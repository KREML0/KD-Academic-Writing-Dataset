1	2978	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, and magazines, being removed from libraries shouldn't be removed. These materials give people a chance to understand how the real world operates. Having certain materials like books and music definitely should not be removed because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book is or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid the type of thing that the book or song is saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M. is, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really, the band is talking about one man's life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. It talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost their legs, and tells how beautiful each and every one of them really is. His book taught me a few things and made me think differently about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk; no matter what, that person is beautiful. As far as movies and magazines have gone within the last few years, I think that they also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think so for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course, we see previews of movies and think that they may not be good, but libraries shouldn't leave them out. Movies are a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarrassed or maybe even get into trouble. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. The same goes for the magazines; they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possibly save your life or perhaps maybe even someone else's life. I don't understand why some libraries would want to ban certain materials that help people understand the things that happen in someone else's life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did. In conclusion, libraries should keep these diverse materials to offer a well - rounded view of the world.
2	2979	2	3	Write a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your views on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials should be removed? I firmly believe they should not. There is no person in charge who should arbitrarily decide to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. There is no valid argument for such removal. Why do I think so? Well, if we start removing materials based on someone's idea of what's appropriate, we limit the access to knowledge and different perspectives. For example, if a student needs a particular book for a school project and it's removed because some find it offensive, that student's educational progress is hindered. Also, we all have different views on what is offensive. What one person finds offensive, another may find thought - provoking. We should respect this diversity. I understand that there are concerns about protecting children, but instead of removing materials from libraries, we can have proper guidance and age - appropriate sections. My e - mail address is @EMAIL1, and I hope through this essay, the newspaper can spread the message that libraries should remain a place of free access to all kinds of materials. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not the solution; rather, education and guidance are the keys to dealing with potentially offensive materials.
3	2980	2	3	Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different opinions of what's good and what's bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my lifetime. I often hear people telling me, 'oh, don't read that book, it's a bad book.' But I ask myself, 'how do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance?' There are indeed some books, music, movies, and magazines out there that are offensive. Yet we still have the curiosity to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books from the libraries, we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think it's offensive? Ask yourself the question again, 'how do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' Don't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own opinion is. In conclusion, libraries should keep a wide range of materials so that people can form their own opinions through personal exploration.
4	2981	2	3	In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive. Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not. Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life. This is even taken to the extreme where people want censorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong. Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries. They find these things to be offensive. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended. The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive. The library is a place for study. It is never intended to offend someone or bring bad to the world. It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library. I have been to the library many times, and in none of those visits have I ever seen anything offensive. Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research. There are certain sections in the library. If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section. I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section. The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not. If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out. Also, if a person complains and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance of getting the materials they need. One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it. If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do is not look at it. The library can be compared to a big computer. One can basically find anything there. Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs. It is a way of learning and researching, and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there. Everyone is going to be offended at some point in their life. If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left. People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone. There does not need to be any censorship in libraries. It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their role as a free - access source of knowledge without the burden of excessive censorship.
5	2982	2	3	In life, you have the 'offensive things'. The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us. No, it is not easy to get over, but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes there are books, magazines, music, and movies that offend us. The only reason why we get offended is because the subject either reflects our personality or our life. It's not the authors' fault; they write what they feel and what is the truth. Okay, so libraries are full of books, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves just because they offend you. Other people may like the book you hate. There are more books in the library you can read. Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library is that it will hurt whoever's company got the book published and also the writers. Writers and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells their books, magazines, movies. They make thousands of copies of their product, which takes money. So, to make their money back, they sell to thousands of bookstores. Most of the offensive material will open the world's eyes. Everybody needs to see what's going on in the world. Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject. Now, the writers' intent isn't to hurt you but to help you. Why can't the world be more open? I know in my own life, I have read books that at first, the book offended me. I would get so mad, I would put the book down and walk away. But then, my eyes would open and finally it hit me. The offensive part out of the book helped me gain a new understanding. The views I used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finally open up, and your life changes. Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes and getting under your skin, you won't ever change. 'Offended' is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it. Some people need to say 'well, this book bugs me'. Stop being so self - centered and get over it. Life is too short to worry and feel offended. Every single book, magazine, movie, and music needs to be left alone. Those materials may reflect other people's life and help others with theirs. Just read another book or watch a different movie. Please do not remove anything from the shelves because it will only do more damage. In conclusion, libraries should preserve all materials to allow for personal growth and a broader understanding of the world.
6	2983	2	3	How would you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? I, along with many other students, would find this discouraging and disastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and a separated population would be born.  Like the beloved Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I would not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like Harry Potter did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity would not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.  If this censorship was to be allowed, who is to say what all could be censored? Who would be the final judge as to what books should be banned? It would all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of separating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe would be wrong. For instance, it would be like a conservative forcing a liberal to not believe in certain social reforms; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship would lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.  Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books would be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world would become similarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality would decrease.  To conclude, censorship would be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how would you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I would feel.
7	2984	2	3	Do you think that you should be able to take certain materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer access. So if you wouldn't mind, sit back, get relaxed in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.  So have you decided what you think about taking them off the shelf of your local library or even your school library. Well, I have come up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example, I bet there are old books in my school library right now that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly outdated.  The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well, just because some people seem that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't become the most popular book in the whole library. The person that likes that book might find that the people that found the book offensive, their stance might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will always have the people that like to complain about something no matter where you go.  I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there were these two guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that were over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys were discussing during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet from the counter these guys were at. So then the guy that was talking about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he asked the librarian where the books were on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.  So that is just to tell you that if you were to take a book, some music, or any other of the things that you can find in a library should just more than likely stay where they are, because the library got those books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magazine, movie, or just need to get on the computer.  Well now that you are probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tell you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neighborhood.  The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example, I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completely off. That is bad that they would have that on their shelf, just because that makes their library look like a trashed up place to go to.  Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a book about someone that was doing drugs and they got caught with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any real trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.  So all in all more than likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have your people that like to complain about every little petty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken too much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelves, just refer back to this essay.
8	2985	2	3	The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.  First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What might be offensive to one person might not be to another. Everyone has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.  The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.  However, some books might not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library might not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.  Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection to uphold the principles of free access to information and individual thought.
9	2986	2	3	All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience. No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive.  Everyone will read a book that they don't like, it's natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way. Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She has gotten into some really horrible situations. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidance in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidance?  Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away. In conclusion, libraries should preserve the diverse range of written materials to ensure that everyone has the chance to discover something meaningful.
10	2987	2	3	A lot of materials today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, age limits, and my views on the censorship of these materials. Here's my idea to fix the problem.  I understand that books and other material might offend certain people, but it might not offend others. That's why I think libraries should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be separate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. It's a great idea because your child wouldn't be open to the bad content.  This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain age to enter the 'bad content' room. I don't think the library staff or their parents want a five - year - old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The age limit could be 18 years of age to enter the room. That seems fair enough. You're old enough to be able to handle the content.  I don't get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people don't mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not.  Separate rooms, age limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very effective. I hope to start seeing that in the future. In conclusion, implementing these measures can strike a balance between protecting sensitive individuals and providing access to diverse content.
11	2988	2	3	Have you ever come across a magazine, book, or movie that you found offensive? What experiences did you have? Here is my opinion on whether those books should be removed or not.  I have noticed that some movies can be offensive to certain people. For example, the @CAPS1 movies and books are about @CAPS2, and some people don't believe in them or simply don't like the movie. So, I kind of see no point in making a movie about something that isn't real. However, some movies are suitable for certain people and their age. The movies rated '@CAPS3' are not meant for kids under a certain age.  Magazines, too, have content that I think can be offensive to others. I don't remember the names of those magazines, but they have sections that speak ill of others. For instance, one of the kids might talk about the president or something similar. So, I think some magazines should be taken off the shelves.  As for books, I don't see a reason to remove them. I don't think books are as offensive as they are graphical. There might be some books that are offensive to people, like those that talk about a poor family or speak badly about them. For example, you might pick up a book and find that it's discussing things you don't want to know.  So, as you can see, I've formed an opinion on whether to keep or remove books, magazines, or movies from the shelves. But I also understand the other side. Some of us like those kinds of movies, books, or magazines and find them very cool or interesting. In the end, it's a complex issue with valid points on both sides, and a balance needs to be struck.
12	2989	2	3	Personally, I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should sell any of the items mentioned if they are found offensive to the public. I believe it offends a large number of people. Citizens, especially senior citizens and children, shouldn't be exposed to inappropriate material. I think to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines, one should be at least eighteen years of age. The economy is already in a bad state. There's a new generation being raised right now, and they shouldn't have memories of seeing offensive movies or reading offensive books and magazines when they look back on their childhood.  I think music has the most influence on a person. If someone constantly listens to foul language and such, it will stay in their mind. I know this from my own experience. I also believe that movies have a great influence on people. For example, a kid watches a movie with a lot of violence. After the movie, he might think, 'It must be okay to kill someone because I saw someone get away with it and not get into trouble.' This is just one example of how a person's mind can change.  In conclusion, I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. However, I think people should be of a certain age for some things. Also, I think anything that citizens find offensive should be placed in a specific area in a store or library. This way, only those who want a particular item can get it without others having to see or listen to offensive content. By doing so, we can respect both the freedom of choice and the well - being of the general public.
13	2990	2	3	A library is a place where you can go to read, write, and relax. Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there. Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship. Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.  First of all, removing classics from the library shelves because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unjustified. If they offend you, simply don't read them. It's that straightforward. Many books offend people because they don't align with their morals or beliefs. A great example is the @PERSON2 series. The @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series is a bestselling one, with over a million copies sold worldwide. However, it doesn't match many people's beliefs, so those people boycott the series.  I remember several years ago, I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the release of the next book in the series. While I was there, a huge storm was brewing. Most people would think it was just a storm, but the people in town who disliked the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party. They said we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to show us that what we were doing was wrong. I know many people don't like the @PERSON2 series because of the witchcraft and wizardry in it, but they shouldn't blame natural occurrences on a book!  Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 shouldn't be banned because of their content. For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was school reading material, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person. Books shouldn't have to meet everyone's personal standards.  Consequently, what Katherine Paterson says is true. If we ban books because we don't agree with them or find them suitable, eventually, there won't be any books left to borrow from the library. However, there could be a compromise. If books with questionable content had a sticker indicating that, it could benefit both sides.  In conclusion, eliminating books is a bad idea because they are so beneficial to all of us, especially children. When I was young, I loved being read to, and as I grew, I always read. In middle school, I always had a book with me. Books allow readers to travel to far - off places and experience life from different perspectives. They are a gateway to another world. We shouldn't take this magic away from children, as it enriches their imagination and understanding of the world.
14	2991	2	3	Yes and no, some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be voted upon by the citizens to be removed from shelves.  I do think that some materials in those categories should be removed if they are offensive to me as well as others. However, it will take a long time to get them removed from stores and other places if other people like them. I don't like how some music is very violent and can corrupt the minds of most teenagers, leading them to start selling drugs in their hometown. But I can't do anything about it because that kind of music is admired by teenagers and some adults. If some people can realize that such things can ruin the lives of teenagers and some adults, there's a chance it can be stopped. Stopping this will save a community from disaster and create better opportunities for those in need.  Here's another example. There's a music artist named @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She has made some great songs in the past year and a half. People have told me that she's part of a group called @CAPS3, where they try to, I think, 're - birth' themselves. My friends wanted me to stop listening to her music. I told them that I don't like the fact that she joined this group, but that doesn't mean I'll stop listening to her music. However, if she makes a song that's offensive to me and my friends, that's when I'll draw the line.  What I'm saying is that if people don't have support when something is highly offensive to them but not to others, it'll be very hard to prove their point in the best way possible. In the end, finding a balance between personal taste and the well - being of the community is crucial.
15	2992	2	3	When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the library staff should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say because they are the ones who use the library.  I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed. For example, some music can be offensive. I'm not saying that all music should be removed from libraries. I'm saying that the offensive music should be taken out. By allowing the community to have a voice in what's on the library shelves, we can ensure that the materials are appropriate and beneficial for everyone. This way, the library can better serve its purpose as a place of knowledge and enjoyment for the whole community.
16	2993	2	3	A lot of students in school have likely come across a book or magazine with profanity that offended them. Some individuals find such things amusing, but for others, it truly bothers them. Not only racial slurs but also profanity can disappoint people. Many parents don't want their children hearing or uttering such words. I firmly believe that if something is offensive, it should be removed from library shelves, and you should share this view too. Regarding movies and music, if they really offend someone, the creators should either change the lyrics or get rid of the work. A good song or great movie shouldn't rely on offending others. One can't create something that mocks another race or depicts the killing of a particular group. When it comes to school libraries, the appropriateness of books depends on the age - group. There shouldn't be any offensive or profane content in elementary or middle - school libraries. Young students aren't old enough or mature enough to encounter such material in books or magazines. So, if a student brings home a class - reading book and the parent dislikes the content, they should have the right to object. And if the content is truly bad, it should be removed from the school. Even high - school students, who are more mature, can be offended by the books they read in school. For instance, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a well - known and good book that many students read. However, a lot of African - American students might be offended by the racial slurs used in it. They feel uncomfortable when fellow students and teachers say those words. Schools and libraries shouldn't force students to read books they're uncomfortable with, nor should libraries stock such books. Take me as an example. Next year, I'll have to read that book, and I'm not looking forward to it. I'm half African - American, and I don't like hearing such offensive language. It'll be an awkward experience for me. I also have friends who felt uncomfortable reading that book. There are even children's books that parents want removed from school libraries. The most challenged book in school libraries is 'Harry Potter'. My librarian told me this. It's a good book, but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards, so they try to get the books out of the library. And they should be able to do so if they don't want their children exposed to such content. In conclusion, if a certain number of people complain about a movie, song, book, or magazine, there shouldn't be a debate. It should be removed. In a school, if students or parents complain in sufficient numbers, the librarian or school shouldn't oppose. Offensive materials should be taken care of by getting rid of them. Parents don't want their kids exposed to inappropriate content, and some people are offended or uncomfortable with certain books or movies. Entertainment should be removed from the world if it offends people.
17	2994	2	3	Do you think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive? This includes magazines, books, movies, and even music. I firmly believe it's not right that the opinions of a few people, based on what they find offensive, should matter. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, people pick these items out themselves, and secondly, when they go to the library, they're looking for something they'll enjoy. The first reason I think certain books, music, movies, and magazines shouldn't be removed from the shelves is that people choose them on their own. No one is likely to pick up a book, magazine, watch a movie, or listen to music that appears, seems, or sounds offensive. Most people don't take being offended lightly. For example, why would someone buy an item that doesn't appeal to them? It just doesn't make sense. The second reason is that when you go to the library, you're on the hunt for an interesting book, a particular type of music, a movie, or a magazine. You'll probably end up with something that catches your eye and suits your taste. So, if a book, music, movie, or magazine looks offensive, simply don't get it. Usually, if something is going to offend you, it'll be quite obvious from its appearance, the way it seems, or even the sound it makes. In my opinion, if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people, they shouldn't be taken off the shelf. When you pick something out at the library or visit the library in search of something enjoyable, you'll clearly be able to tell if something looks, seems, or sounds offensive. Therefore, we should respect the freedom of choice and keep these items on the shelves for those who may find value in them.
18	2995	2	3	If the people who are publishing and writing articles in these magazines feel offended by the controversial things inside the magazine or books, it's understandable. There are always those individuals who will find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these sensitive things. These people are often called 'troublemakers'. They can easily stir up trouble. That's why before I buy a magazine, I always take a look inside first. I check to see if I'm interested in buying that specific book or magazine. If I don't like what I see inside it, then I won't buy it. It's as simple as that. If the content is offensive, it should immediately be removed from the newsstands on the streets of major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, and other well - known locations. In conclusion, offensive content has no place on public newsstands, and we should ensure that the materials available to the public are appropriate and non - offensive.
19	2996	2	3	I think that all the inappropriate books should be taken out of a library. These bad books, along with offensive music, magazines, and movies, aren't what most people want to read or engage with. If a young kid picks up a book and reads it, and there's bad content in it, such as in books, magazines, music, or movies, it can have a negative impact. If the child is too young to distinguish whether the movies or other items in the library are bad, then it's the library's responsibility for allowing them access to such materials. If a parent doesn't know that their child has read a bad book, they'll be left wondering where their child picked up those bad phrases from. There are indeed people who believe that libraries should not have any bad books. There are numerous elements in books that parents don't want their children to read. For example, there are books that discuss sex, and there can be language that is inappropriate for kids. I'm certain that I don't want my kids to be exposed to such bad content as they grow older. Similarly, there's music that parents don't want their children to listen to. There are so - called sex songs, and there are also songs that imply sexual content without directly stating it. I would never want my kids to listen to such terrible songs. I want them to be responsible and avoid such inappropriate music. Movies are another concern. I don't want my kids to watch movies with inappropriate content. Nowadays, so many movies contain bad elements, most of which are related to sex. Lately, a large number of newly - released movies are highly inappropriate. Magazines are also a problem. There are many undesirable things that can be found in magazines, such as porn. I detest the idea of kids being tempted or forced to look at porn. In general, we should get rid of porn and disgusting pictures in magazines. In conclusion, it's essential to protect children from inappropriate content in libraries, and we should take steps to ensure that libraries are filled with suitable materials for all ages.
20	2997	2	3	Dear Newspaper, how would you feel if someone wrote a book about how bad the newspapers are, and then tore you down so badly that no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it. If something is found offensive, should it be available for thousands and thousands of other people to read? I firmly believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, etc., that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a library's bookshelves, let alone even be on the shelves. Now, let's take a moment to think about this. What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an innocent child who could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up adopting the kind of life that the book portrays. If I were a parent, I know for sure that I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they can distinguish right from wrong and have a clear judgment on such matters. From another perspective, what if that one book, which claims that black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands? For this purpose, let's say a drunken, old - fashioned man who happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white man's thoughts, and he could try to put his thoughts into action. He might throw what the book says about black people in a young black woman's face. Then, after seeing the impact it has on her, he could rape and beat her. Only to let her live and make her his own slave for as long as she's alive. Can you imagine this world when only she knows how badly she's hurting? She's the only one who knows how long she will have to deal with the pain before she stops fighting for her life. Just think, all that I've told you about, and the examples I've given, all started with that one single offensive book. These are all valid reasons for those books to be banned from libraries or at least be firmly fixed to the shelves. In conclusion, offensive materials can have far - reaching and dangerous consequences, and we must take steps to protect the public, especially the vulnerable, from their influence.
21	2998	2	3	Dear news people, I am writing to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I firmly believe it is okay for people to write whatever they want because this is a free country where you can do anything that you think you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books however they want, including themes such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on. You get what I'm saying. I think it's okay to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's the person who is picking a book. If they choose to read a book and just because they don't like what the book is about, they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can simply not pick the book up and look for another book. I don't think it's fair that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all. It makes no sense to me, and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I were someone who was against stuff like sex and drugs and I saw it in a book, I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with rather than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fair and it's a waste of time to me if someone has to complain about something so dumb. So, to wrap this thing up, I think people who don't like the way books are written should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waste time and cause a problem. That's my opinion about this problem, and I hope it is yours too.
22	2999	2	3	I think that books, magazines, papers etc. shouldn't be removed from the libraries because some students like to read them. Some students feel that reading a book about their problem will help them get through whatever problem they are having. Students often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those students can get the books and read them to help them solve their problems. If the books etc. are offensive, then the students who think they are shouldn't get them. They can't control what books are in the library. Some students have problems and some of the books can help them. A lot of students I know don't think that a lot of books are offensive. It's either they want to read them or they don't. If students think that books etc. are offensive, they will just have to deal with it. Students like to read all kinds of books and some don't even like to read. For the students who like to read, they can pick whatever book they want that they feel comfortable with. If they think that a book is offensive, they can go past it and find a different book to read. I suppose if you find an offensive book, you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. I'm sure that they won't do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For students to read', and to understand what their life is and how to fix it. You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be on the shelf and what can't be on the shelf. In conclusion, I think that students should deal with it because they can't control it.
23	3000	2	3	Hello, my name is [Name], I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries. If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media. People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like, they are able to put it back on the shelf. People say The [Book 1] and the [Book 2] inspired [Person 2] to kill [Person 1], that is completely speculated. It's all a matter of 'he said she said.' I feel there should be sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un - democratic. There should be a parent supervising children 12 and younger, because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something they're not ready for. There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in libraries, and those are as follows: pornography, non - educational movies, [Specific Offensive Content 1] [Specific Offensive Content 2], and social networks. I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace, but there should be some leeway on books. This is an approved message. Thank you for your time, goodbye.
24	3001	2	3	Books Removed From Shelves? 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement was from [Person 1]. Do you think it is right for young children to look at images that are not appropriate or read something that is talking about sexual content? I do not think any of these materials should be removed from the shelves, but they should be put in a private area where only adults can get to them. I think they should be put in a certain area, away from children, because children will get ideas from the material that they see and think it is okay to act like that. There are some books and movies out there that teenagers and young children see that are about serial killers, and children think it is okay to bring guns to school, and it is not okay. Children are reading these books and thinking it is okay to act like their favorite character or acting like their favorite movie star in a movie. Some of the movies that are out there are about doing stupid stuff, and children and teenagers think it is 'cool' because the person that they look up to is doing that, so they want to try it out also. Children get hurt from doing such things. Whenever a child sees people having sex, they think it is okay to do it too, because those kids in the movies are the same age as they are. I think that movie producers should be aware of what they put out there for children to watch. When you talk about the book [Book Name 1] [Book Name 2], you think what a great book. But would you ever think that it would be taken off of shelves because of one word that was used in it? I think that it should stay on the shelves, but if a parent does not want their child to read it, then they do not have to read it. If parents do not want their child to read something, then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book. I think the books should stay on the shelves, and any material that has any 'bad' content on it should be put in a private section where only adults can get to it. Do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content? Children are getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music. They think it is appropriate to act like such characters, because their favorite movie star is performing in such a way. These books, movies, and magazines need to be put up out of children's reach, so they cannot get anymore bad ideas to do stupid stuff. In conclusion, a proper balance should be maintained to ensure that both access to diverse content and the protection of children are considered.
25	3002	2	3	I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way. So if you're wanting to take every movie off the shelf, then go ahead. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to it. If a book does, don't read it. It's as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. that could offend someone, and here are my reasons why: If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people nowadays, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble. I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever it is they want to listen to. Also, if they find it offensive, then they just shouldn't listen to that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyone is offended in different ways from another. So we can't help it if a little book, song, etc., offends a person. I also think if you give a kid the chance to read a book, and he sees how offensive it might be, it might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book. Also, if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that not everybody is a good person. Children read in a wide variety. Some read their Dr. Seuss books, and others could be reading [Author Name]'s [Book Name]. Depending on the children, they should be able to choose what they read, listen to, or watch. The only flaw I find about children and some magazines is the fact that almost every magazine has at least a half - naked woman or man in it. Children in their elementary school years through about the first year of middle school should not have to see that. My final reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as it does not offend them. What they're reading should not have any effect on others unless they are reading it also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that it's life. They will get offended more than a handful of times in their life. In conclusion, I think that people should be able to read what they want, even the books people find offensive. The offensive things should not be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive, then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also, that not everyone is a good person, and things happen that people don't like, but it's life. Finally, I think people should not have to give up reading, listening to, watching, or looking at things that they find interesting.
26	3003	2	3	The world is full of offensive material, and there is almost nothing we can do about it. These books that we leave behind have a significant influence on the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because they are part of a large variety of knowledge, and the library is not the only place someone will look for such material. On the logical side of this, the more a person knows, the more power one has. However, that doesn't mean that some items such as certain types of music or movies are appropriate for his or her age. Some parents get really offended when they see something slightly inappropriate, but the thing to remember is that those so - called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up. In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have a large mass of information to choose from because there is no perfect little soul, and everyone has amounts of curiosity. For example, things like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be considered dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1, we learn the ways of atoms and make predictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety equipment because of the dangerous environment. The same goes for @CAPS1, where one learns about how to live a healthy life, and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3, we learn better how the world works around us, and with this, we learn things that can be dangerous. With everything that we do, there are positive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strictly entertainment, and those items that have no real value should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place, but if it is some magazine talking about drama, it appears very useless. In this large world, there always was and always will be people or material that are a bad influence. Yet this is all a matter of perception, and everyone has different tolerances and values. With this ongoing problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our abilities, based off of our values.
27	3004	2	3	People are entitled to their own opinion about things. What someone might find offensive, someone else might not. Libraries should be able to put anything that might interest a person or educate someone on their shelves, whether people get offended or not. If we went by what everyone said, we probably wouldn't have anything on the library shelves. People will find something wrong with everything a person can put out; that's just human nature. I have read non - fiction books and seen movies that are based on true stories that have used words and language that some people might find offensive. But how are people going to express their feelings and educate others without offending someone? How are we supposed to teach history without telling the whole story? Slavery and the @PERSON1 were horrible things that happened, and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again. It would be extremely difficult to teach about these horrible events without offending some people. I believe that we should put these materials on our library shelves anyway, and if people do not like it, then they should not check them out or look at them. That's my opinion. What's yours?
28	3005	2	3	I think if people find books offensive, they should not even read that book to begin with. If books are found offensive and taken from shelves, then book shelves would be empty. Then there would be nothing left for people to read. Some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books. If you take them off the shelves, you will be getting rid of the greatest literary material. @PERSON1 @CAPS1, for example, in the book '@CAPS2', it contains content that is offensive to gays and one character gets killed. Such books, despite their offensive elements, often carry important messages and themes that contribute to the richness of literature. Removing them would be a great loss to the literary world and to those who seek knowledge and different perspectives through reading.
29	3006	2	3	A book is more than just words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it truly amazing how someone from one country could write a book, and then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today. There are many problems with entertainment today in my opinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy, which @MONTH1 may not be fit for some people. I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake. I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life. In conclusion, entertainment, despite its flaws, plays a crucial role in our personal growth and understanding of the world.
30	3007	2	3	I don't believe that certain books, music, magazines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive, then that is not my problem. If they offend me, then oh well, that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later, society will find them again, and they will be back on the shelves. No matter how offensive they are, curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book is found offensive by one person or group of people, that doesn't mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with. Anything and everything is educational in its own way. Even if it is offensive, it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said, is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to be removed from the shelves? It depends on a person's personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not, things are offensive to somebody out there, and there is nothing we can do out there to change that. It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offense to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it, nothing should be removed from the shelves. For if one thing must be removed, then you might as well remove everything, as the line of what is offensive is often subjective and varies from person to person.
31	3008	2	3	I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf just because some people find it offensive. After all, everyone has different sensitivities and perspectives. If we start removing items based on offense, then all the books would be off the shelf eventually. Sometimes the really good books are those that are offensive, because they are actually telling you what the author really believes in, challenging our existing views and making us think.   I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school. The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book. Even teachers were reading it, finding value in its content. The school board did not even care though. I think that was completely handled the wrong way. They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody else was enjoying and learning from it. If it offended her, then she should simply not read it.  Music is an outlet for many people. They can express their innermost feelings in a way that is truly amazing. Without music, there would not be as much fun and emotional release in the world. People are always listening to music, whether they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc. It serves as a companion in different moods. If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it. They can easily switch to a genre or a song that suits their taste.  Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time. That is what makes a movie: a hero and a villain. We want the good guys to win, and the movie often makes fun of the bad guys. Inevitably, somebody is always going to get hurt, either emotionally or in terms of their beliefs. But that's part of the storytelling.  When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else. I think of how the artist feels. Why they wrote it that certain way. If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first. Then if I like it, I start singing it. If I do not like it, then I just change the song.  I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended. We need the different opinions in life. If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in any way. I do not want to be the same as everybody else. I love my unique personality. I am different and kind of an outcast, but I am true to myself. And I respect other people's opinions. I wish everyone would do the same. Or at least try to do the same. Thank you for listening to what I had to say.
32	3009	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people generally have enough sense to distinguish what they are interested in and what they are not interested in. They can make their own choices based on their preferences and knowledge. There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is. So, censorship does not really make a significant difference to the individual. Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone else's interference in helping them find what they are looking for.  Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always come across something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in during their exploration. People's interests are their own business, and they should be free from the censorship of others in the surrounding community. For example, I've read a couple of books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it. The overall value and message of the book remain intact. People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies. These flaws do not necessarily detract from the overall appeal. Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in. The individual does not need edited objects or music to enjoy what they choose without being offended. There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something.  In conclusion, censorship is an unnecessary measure as individuals are well - equipped to make their own choices regarding the media they consume. We should respect the diversity of content and let people decide for themselves.
33	3010	2	3	Many people believe that magazines, books, movies, music, posters, plus some other kind of content that parents don't want their children to see should not be removed from the shelves. People have enough common sense to know what they are interested in and what they are not. There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is. For instance, in the context of books about different - colored people, there might be some content that touches on sensitive topics related to skin - color heritage. Some of these books might have descriptions or discussions that some individuals could find offensive.   A lot of local libraries have a wide variety of such materials spread around all over the store. Some of these people that get these books might need to have an open mind about what the book is saying about the skin color. If they don't like what the book has to say, then they should simply put it back on the shelf. Because you can't change the way the author wrote the story, music, movie, or poster. In fact, most of the people that I know who are of different colors are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it themselves. They understand that these are just different perspectives and not meant to be offensive.  Maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book, but that doesn't mean the whole book should be removed. We should allow people to make their own decisions about whether to engage with such content or not. After all, exposure to different ideas, even those that might seem offensive at first, can help us grow and understand the world better.
34	3011	2	3	Would you want your children reading about things that only adults know's what? When you go to a library, you expect to learn about history, science, famous people's achievements, cultures, etc. Libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in your future life. When you first walk into a library, you expect to see people checking out history books, or books that catch your eye just by the title. If we find a book is offensive, or will not help better our children's future, then we should stand up and fight for their own mental development.  We must also think of what the children want to read. They have the right to read whatever they want, as long as it's entertaining to them and they are learning something new. Some books teach them about the world they are growing up in. There are some books that I would not let my own child read, but I know in my heart that she is learning something that I might not be able to teach her. Those types of books are what I call, 'eye - openers'. Those books that can come off seeming offensive, when in the end they are actually, what I call 'reality - checkers', helping to prepare them for what is to come. Not every book will be full of rainbows, pretty colors, or pop - ups. They must know that there are some people they have to be mindful of, and people who are educating them on real - life situations. They have to learn the difference between what's right and what's wrong.  Remember the first book you ever read by yourself? I do. It was called 'Of Courage and Sacrifice'. I read that book when I was ten. Till this day my mother says, 'I tried to stop you from reading that book so many times, it had dangerous wording that a ten - year - old should not be able to read at that young age'. What she did not know was that that book had taught me a lot about the world back then. That knowledge I had obtained then had helped me later on in my life.  Some books are meant to be read while some aren't. If you feel your child should not read a certain book, then read it for yourself, and then tell your child the reason why they can not read the same book you had just read. In this way, we can balance the protection of our children with their need for knowledge and growth.
35	3012	2	3	Libraries have a lot of material to read about. They have children's books all the way to adult books. All of the books vary according to different age groups, ensuring that there is something for everyone. So many people visit the library every day, seeking knowledge, entertainment, or resources for their studies. But the question is, should certain materials be taken off the shelves because they are found offensive? The answer is a resounding no.  When people go to the library, that means they want to learn something, or find something to entertain them. When you go to the library to research something, and they do not have the book you need, or the movie you need, what are you going to do? What happens when you are doing a project over something, and they do not have the book you need? Do you want your children failing in school because the libraries take materials off the shelves? This could seriously hamper their educational progress.  People should not take materials off the shelves because 'they do not like it.' If they think it is offensive, then they should put it back on the shelf and go find something else. They do not have to take it off the shelf because they are against it. Everyone has different beliefs on things, and that's what makes our society diverse.  Libraries have different sections to go find materials at. It varies from kids' books, fiction, and non - fiction. It also sometimes goes by what you are looking for, such as specific topics or authors. No one should take something off the shelf if it is offensive because it was their choice to look at it in the first place. No one can tell you what you can and can't look at when you go to a library. If they do not like what they see, then put it down. It is that easy. If you can not find what you are looking for, then libraries also have computers to look up things, providing an alternative way to access information.  In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of library materials and let individuals make their own choices about what they want to engage with. Removing materials based on personal offense is not a solution and can have negative consequences for the users of the library.
36	3013	2	3	There are numerous types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials may be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own specific type of information and preferred genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; older people like informational books. Everyone is different in their own unique way. The material they choose to read is their own personal choice. How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or inappropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it truly their decision to say that some things offend people? Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someone's music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. There's a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it. Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy. It's essential to respect individual choices and allow the freedom to access diverse materials in the library.
37	3014	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left on the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think exactly the same. Though certain books or magazines may have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgeable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now. If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a clear warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up detailed reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not. People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truly enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more censored rather than tolerated. If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library? In conclusion, libraries should balance the need for access to diverse materials with appropriate safeguards, rather than simply removing potentially offensive items.
38	3015	2	3	One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right, no one would be able to freely express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves. What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the section that they belong. Sections for children's books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the detailed anatomy of the human body does not belong in the children's section. Beyond this basic categorization, the library should leave the rest of the decisions to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdraw the book. The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries. In a free - society, the library should be a place that respects individual choices and upholds the freedom of access to information.
39	3016	2	3	Writing is a powerful way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive. The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible and unhygienic practices of the meat - packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a significant reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it. Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the real - world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what separates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else. Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never. We must preserve the access to all forms of literature to ensure continuous learning and growth.
40	3017	2	3	A book represents a person's beliefs and feelings about a topic. Therefore, censoring books is wrong because it goes against the fundamental freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it may be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. If we do not accept other people's beliefs, we are just as prejudiced as the books we are trying to censor. Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the Holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, then they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just because we are ashamed of something doesn't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to strike again like a hungry alligator. Instead, books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act. While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people may find it offensive. There is a much easier solution than censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can. The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds it offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the @CAPS3. Censoring that book would basically tell the @CAPS4 population that they are wrong. Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decide if they should read it, or not. In a democratic society, we must uphold the freedom of access to diverse ideas and information through uncensored books.
41	3018	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that no book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. People may not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc. For instance, certain novels with complex themes or explicit content might be too much for younger readers. And so, if the libraries have a problem with some of the materials, then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraries keep all types of books and magazines, so what would be their reason to take the material off the shelf? I think that there are different types of people in the world, and everyone's going to want to read something different.  If libraries are going to take the material off the shelf that people don't like, then the material that others like would be gone. For example, if I were to take the 'Harry Potter' series off the shelves, then all the 'Harry Potter' fans would be furious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There is a lot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries aren't going to take them off the shelves.  Some parents aren't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, racy book, but that's what other adults enjoy reading. Those books aren't going to go away, but if parents have problems with it, then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever, and you can't make them go away because you don't want your children to read them.  From experience, I've read a couple of racy books, and they are disturbing for me, being an immature audience. But I'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the shelf. Some books are very vulgar and nasty in the ways they describe fights or wars or abuse, but some people like reading literature like that, so the libraries will keep them. If people have problems with books, then stay away from them and don't read them. It's as simple as that.  In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interests and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgar, then they shouldn't read that book, and if they don't want their children and teenagers to read the book either, then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because that's not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them. Sincerely, @PERSON1.
42	3019	2	3	From many thoughts and arguments, people disagree with the school libraries. The main reason is because of the books, magazines, articles, and internet that contains content very disturbing for children. Such content includes material such as violence, drugs, and nudity. For example, some books might graphically describe drug use or violent acts. In this argument, parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content. Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to.  Today, libraries are not focused enough on the materials that they have on their shelves. That is how children could get the idea of being a 'bad kid' in school. They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs, violence, or nudity in the materials they access. But if the libraries have censored content in the library, then kids might not enjoy it as much as they would if they had uncensored content. In the parents' thoughts, uncensored content should be kept away from children.  The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves. They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library. They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children. It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material.  There are parents who have kids in school, who do not care about what they learn or what they do. Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning every day. Then they can at least teach their children about uncensored content.  Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to. Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child. The fault goes to the parents and the libraries. They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at. In conclusion, by working together, parents and libraries can create a safer and more appropriate learning environment for children.
43	3020	2	3	Do you want your nine - year - old child talking and reading about inappropriate subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my child. I think books that are offensive and inappropriate shouldn't be in elementary school or even middle schools with younger kids or even 12 years olds. And parents should be in control of what their kids watch and listen to.  Honestly, we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs, but we can control who listens to them and watches them. It's the parents that are the only ones who can control their children, no one else.  In libraries, I feel like it's the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect, but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the books young teens are checking out are appropriate enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that 12 year olds shouldn't be reading.  Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have 14 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or magazine. And it should have parents' permission on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be allowed to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.  All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason their kids are immature and rude because they let their children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes, parents and other people do have the right to censor movies and books, etc.  But what about movie theaters you ask? DON'T TAKE YOUR CHILD TO THE MOVIE THEATER YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school go to the movies after school with friends and get in to see rated R movies without parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake IDs so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will go home that night and want to re - enact what they saw in the movie. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen, and I think the parents should grow up and discipline their students. I've seen too many parents letting their children get away with their mouth and attitude. Most of my friends' parents let their children get away with everything.  One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want, and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents, and they either say we don't have enough money or you don't need it, and I just move on with my life. But I don't let books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the educational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world.  In conclusion, parents and relevant authorities need to take more responsibility in ensuring that children and teens are exposed to appropriate content, whether it's in libraries, movie theaters, or other media.
44	3021	2	3	In this millennium, we really shouldn't be too concerned about censorship. People say so much worse in public and do worse things in public. On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. It's the parents' fault if their child gets a hold of a book that has adult content on or in it. So why should we have censorship?  If a CD contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf and starts listening to it, then it's the parents' fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. The same goes for books and other media. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab, then they should be able to listen to it and ask questions about it. If it's about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility.  Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and etc. contain racism in it, then it should be censored, unless it's about history. Kids under the age of teen usually repeat what they hear or read. The same goes for teenagers too actually! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be an age limit to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get a hold of these books and repeating what they hear.  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than 8 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was no where to be seen nor heard. Who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. This was no one's fault, not the library's, not mine. People should take responsibility, control their kids, and if they can't, then leave them at home!  There are also certain people who need books for research and need to take home books for their projects. We shouldn't have censorship and take down all the books that should be kept from kids. Some of us need those kinds of books in order for us to do our research and projects!  No, we shouldn't have censorship in our libraries! I'm not about to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and etc. There could be a way to censor most books, but they would need their own shelf, and there could be an age limit or a pass people could use. That would take too long to do though. So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them! In conclusion, a balanced approach where parents take responsibility and libraries maintain access to a wide range of materials is the best way forward.
45	3022	2	3	Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander wherever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on its content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books may be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.  First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, 15 - year - old boy, growing up in an all - white town. Never in your life have you seen an African American. You go to the library and pick up 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X.' This young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.  Next, libraries are used so often by college students to write papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse - including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non - fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed this book for its explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.  Libraries are open to people of all ages. It is understandable that a twelve - year - old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area.  In conclusion, libraries should strive to provide a diverse collection of books to meet the various needs of their patrons. By maintaining access to a wide range of materials and using appropriate sectioning, libraries can ensure that both educational and imaginative opportunities are available to all, while also being mindful of age - appropriate access.
46	3023	2	3	Book @CAPS1     @CAPS2 I firmly believe that the decision about removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and-or magazines should be an individual's choice. I've always held the view that this is part of our constitutional right.     I read a lot of urban books because that's @CAPS2 I truly enjoy. They relate to where I've been, or where I @MONTH1 potentially be going in my life. Now, they are not the kinds of books I'd read to my grandchildren, but they @MONTH1 choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies.      You @MONTH1 not find pleasure in reading the materials that I enjoy, but that doesn't mean you should ban them. There are numerous books and movies that I don't care for, yet I wouldn't ask for them to be banned. If everyone started @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they don't like, there'd be no need for movies, libraries, or bookstores. Kids wouldn't have a proper future as they wouldn't know where they came from. What's bad to you @MONTH1 not be bad to me, or the next person.     When you enter a library or bookstore, you usually already have an idea of @CAPS2 you're looking for. If there are books that aren't appropriate for kids, they should have their own section clearly marked, 'For @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. We are the @CAPS3 and parents. We should be the ones in control of our kids and @CAPS2 they read and watch. I don't think @CAPS1 the materials would solve the problem because kids these days, if they want them badly enough, will figure out a way to read or watch them anyway.                                                 Ann                                        @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.
47	3024	2	3	Libraries are our invaluable way of knowing what has happened in the past, whether it's all fact or perhaps a bit of fiction.  No matter what type of book it is, it still vividly tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should definitely not be censored.     Taking away one book just because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inappropriate for young readers is completely wrong.  I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can potentially lead to experimentation, but isn't that part of life?  At least once in our existence on earth, we find ourselves curious about something and we try it, just to see what it's like. It's all a valuable learning experience.      History would most likely be the most touchy subject in our libraries mainly because we're ashamed of how we acted thirty plus years ago, like the discrimination in @LOCATION1, the @CAPS1, and now the wars in the Middle East. Some countries don't even teach their own history to students in school because they're embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @CAPS6, why and what happened. Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future, not destroy it.      Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @NUM1. If anything, we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @CAPS4 and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries have been there for like forty years, so it's completely pointless to remove them when they've already educated young minds for over forty years.      I truthfully don't understand why you'd want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker. All that's doing is giving readers less material to read.  In @LOCATION2, elementary educators aren't required to teach their students @CAPS6 to spell, at all. I walked into a third - grade classroom and watched a girl spell @CAPS2 '@CAPS3' thinking that was the correct way to spell @CAPS2. The @ORGANIZATION1's excuse for not having teachers teach @CAPS6 to spell is that they should learn that from reading books every day. Well, guess what @LOCATION2, with the @CAPS4, gaming systems, and iPods, little kids aren't taking to reading like they did ten years ago, and we're going to have a lot of future adults not knowing @CAPS6 to read, and this is what it's going to be like.      '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@CAPS6 should I know, I wasn't taught @CAPS6 to spell in @LOCATION2.'     You see what I mean, so if you're going to take away the ability to spell, you better not take away our books because they're the only things teaching our @ORGANIZATION1's future on @CAPS6 to spell simple words.        Today we have the @CAPS4, gaming systems, iPods, and @CAPS8 to entertain us on a daily basis. No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom; they're just sitting on the couch watching television. And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers, you're not encouraging us to read. You're taking away all of the interesting parts of a book. To be truthful, I'll read and reread a book many times over if it's a good story with some extra excitement. I don't enjoy books that don't have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories, or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring. When I read books like that, they make me feel better about my life and @CAPS6 I interact with others. I've learned @CAPS6 to deal with all of those things from books. Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books, and I'd hate for my children not to be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books.
48	3025	2	3	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if they're offensive, people still have the right to access that information. I base this opinion on the guidelines our country was built on, namely freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture would be the beginning of a flood of books being removed by everyone who has ever disagreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's pause and think about what it means for something to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in our world every day, and books and movies in our libraries are probably quite low down on the offensive totem pole compared to, say, the internet or the news. I'd think so, wouldn't you? Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries are for people to learn and teach; they aren't made to be offensive or rude. In my experience as a @NUM1+ year user of libraries, I've never found anything to be offensive or hurtful to anyone. In conclusion, there are just too many books about too many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and to whom. In conclusion to that, libraries are a place of learning and teaching, and the information inside is meant to be helpful and constructive, not offensive or hurtful. To start removing materials now would eventually lead to the end of libraries, which would be a great loss to our society.
49	3026	2	3	Have you ever been offended? Did you react impulsively, or did you keep an open mind and attempt to understand? People are offended by numerous things every day in life. So, we should expand our perspectives and view these 'offenses' as a normal part of life.     You're at a party, and there's a large bowl full of colorful candy placed right beside the front door. You walk in and pick up a piece. Wait, you don't fancy that piece? What will you do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and discard them, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and select a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that imply for the other party guests? You've limited their choices due to your own self - centered opinion. That candy could have been a favorite among the guests. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' opportunity to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, right?     If you're browsing through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back on the shelf and search for a new one. If you're having difficulty finding the right book, politely ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. You could even go to a different library, but don't meddle with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as seemingly insignificant as a book.     The key point is, if you don't like something, just ignore it. The moment the book, and only the book, starts causing real problems is the moment anyone should step in. But, come on, do you really think a single book could cause a major problem? If your child is having issues, don't you think you should first check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I'd consider as a cause of a problem, if I even thought of it at all. Opinions can cause a great deal of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, don't you agree?
50	3027	2	3	The libraries can contain books that are offensive to both humans and animals. The books that are extremely offensive can contain negative comments just to amuse the readers.      I firmly believe that all books, music, magazines, and so on should be removed from the shelves if they're found to contain offensive and negative things about any human. For example, in political cartoons inside newspapers, @PERSON1 is sometimes compared with a @CAPS1. We, as @CAPS2 @CAPS3, find it extremely offensive when someone in our own race is called a @CAPS1. I take that very personally because, back during the time when black people were not able to do certain things, the whites would refer to blacks as monkeys.      Being offended is not a good thing, and the last place we need offensive stuff is in the libraries. Libraries are supposed to hold positive material on the shelves. Books that offer knowledge to people in need, not things that contain negative depictions of human life. Also, children should be able to pick up a book and not feel offended by it.      One night, my little brother came home with a book that he got from the library. It was about a white dog and a dark - colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep. But one day, the dark - colored dog was left out in the cold while a loving family took in the white dog into their warm home. My brother felt so uncomfortable with that book that he decided to take it back that same night.     Libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person feel sick to their stomach. Offensive things can hurt a person's feelings, and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book. Even though my brother found a book that he disliked, he still continues to go to the library to find excellent books to read. Libraries are great places to visit, but they need to be free of offensive content that can hurt a person's feelings so that everyone can enjoy the learning and reading experience they offer.
51	3028	2	3	Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I firmly disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is precisely what makes our world so individualized. Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the impressionable youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you can clearly see language being blocked out. They take parts out to make the book seem more classy, and also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors would leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things. This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meant to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would our society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1. Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people. This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds. In a world without the stifling grip of censorship, creativity and individuality can truly flourish.
52	3029	2	3	wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movie white men cant jump. yes that movie could have offended me a lot but it didn't personally. I thought it was really funny and I enjoyed it cause it's true. Statistics say black people can jump higher than white people. It's all on how you look at it. You have to have a good sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that. Everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. But it's your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. Life is so much easier when you don't cry over every little thing that someone said to you. See now I have a sense of humor. When I was watching that movie, I was laughing so hard I almost peed myself. I didn't care that it singled out white people. So what? It's funny. To kill a mockingbird was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and I can see why. It had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot. But back then it was a different time. The people in the book weren't saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. He wasn't offending you. If you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. Some things you just have to let go and let them roll off your body. In conclusion, yes we have had a lot of offensive stuff said to us but you can't let it get you down so much. You have to move on. And if you move on you will be a better - adjusted person in the long run, able to handle the diverse and sometimes rough - edged nature of human interaction.
53	3030	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a great way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is really good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same. Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could also be bad things. Some talk about non - fiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us might be curious to read but none of us should really read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a child's story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little bit of common sense and discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library. Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old - fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little children's songs which no matter how annoying most of it is, it's okay for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music. The music of this world is very diverse. The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't, be good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce. There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someone's mind but some are good and educational. So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is. Next time you're in a library, just use your head and exercise some discretion to make the best choices.
54	3031	2	3	Every library has tons of information on just about everything. There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information. There is even some information that some people might take offence to. On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it. I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelves, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa. The subject of race might come into play in some books in libraries. Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race. Some people want books taken out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be an important part of history that people need to be educated about. Some books have words that are very offensive to people because of their skin color, religion, or ethnic race. This is information that people need to know because that's how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today. Libraries have all kinds of information. I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain. Even if some content is offensive to some people it could still be an important part of history that people need to know. By keeping these books, libraries can serve as a platform for understanding the past, learning from it, and working towards a more inclusive future.
55	3032	2	3	In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people. This is because everyone has different views on everything. Another reason is because for learning purposes in schools and etc. As well as authors would not want to be writing books because the bookshelves are empty and their books, movies, magazines are getting rejected. Since most people have different views on everything then, every book or magazine would be taken off the shelf if they were offensive because, therefore, there would not be any book or magazine left on the shelf. This is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive it @MONTH1 not be to another person. Therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive. Another problem with taking 'offensive' books off the shelf is that it would result in people not learning in schools and etc. This is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars, slavery, and politics. If all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this. In conclusion nobody would be being taught why these events happened and why these events are wrong, so people would not have changed, they would keep doing these things because they were not taught not to. This in my opinion would cause a lot of conflict between people and nobody would be educated on these events of history. On the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelves. In this I mean that authors, producers, would not be making movies or writing books because their work just keeps getting rejected. Not only rejected but nobody is going to go through the time and effort to make one of these for it to be rejected because it was offensive. In my opinion it would almost be impossible for these authors/ directors to make an unoffensive book or movie for everyone that is going to read or watch it. In conclusion I have read many books in class every year that offends at least one person, but this person can choose not to finish the movie, book, or magazine if they find it offensive, or they never have to read it again. In conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone. This is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened, and people would not be reading any books in school. As well as authors would not be writing since their books are getting removed and the shelves are empty. By allowing these materials to remain, we preserve the opportunity for growth, learning, and the free exchange of ideas in our society.
56	3033	2	3	Why should we be more careful of what we get at the library? Libraries can have books with knowledge, fun, romance, and action or adventure, but some can be disturbing and gruesome. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornography or gruesome action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneaky and do things behind the parents' backs. The reason is that they think they need to act this way because it's cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is what some of the parents are saying nowadays. Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because nowadays all books have something that is bad for our minds. So why do we need to be more careful with the books we put in our library and the books we take out of our library? It can cause the world to change very fast. Now libraries are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The library is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view, the library is one of my most favorite places to be. Anywhere there are books involved, count me in. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventures that some of us will never get to do. Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them cause us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books, it will help the families to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really is just the books and such that cause our minds to picture things that make us think we need them. Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys' minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad for our minds because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to know what is happening in this world today. They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decorating, on how to decorate your weddings and etc. Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching documentaries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without. So why do we need to be more careful for what we put in libraries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out books, magazines, movies and etc. that are really bad for our minds. So it can help our children to grow up well - behaved and mature. Also one more thing, books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use them right. How do we know we got a good book? We find the right books for us by following our heart and our instincts. By being more cautious about library content, we can ensure a healthier and more positive environment for everyone, especially our children.
57	3034	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate. If we got rid of all of the books from our world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read. If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about. Children should be allowed to read books such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Great Gatsby, and The Catcher in the Rye in order to get a taste of how much times have changed. Stories from grandparents only take a person back about 70 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years. Some families, such as an African - American family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history. It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated. We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations. Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted. Money is not readily available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture. How is a young girl from a small town in Iowa supposed to find out how people in Japan live their life? For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos. I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society. Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well. If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten. Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves. Ever since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style. Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows. There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation. Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality. Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or our world. Now, some parents may have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids. If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally. They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves. Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in our world is beyond me. It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides. It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding. Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful. They represent self - expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source. Without them, we would be and have nothing. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of literary and media content and use parental guidance to ensure a balanced learning experience for the younger generation.
58	3035	2	3	Many people think that offensive material should be removed from the library because children could pick them up and look in them. I do not believe this should be done. They already have a children's section. If a child looks in an inappropriate book outside of the children's section, then it's their fault. I do not think it should inconvenience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that CD, game, book, or movie they were looking for. It is very hard to come across an inappropriate book without looking for it on purpose. It could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inappropriate at all. These are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate. Who knows, we might have to vote on it someday. In making such a decision, we should weigh the importance of free access to information against the potential risks to children, and ensure that any actions taken are reasonable and balanced.
59	3036	2	3	Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as I can remember. Now everyone is supposed to share their opinions on pulling these offensive books off the shelf? What is the difference between someone saying something offensive or writing it? Ok, so maybe you don't want your child reading something unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say something unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldn't want your kids reading, why would it have been published? Publishers do read the books they publish; they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you can't be mature enough to take an article, book, or magazine seriously, then you don't need to be reading it anyway. In the news or radio, you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isn't because of unsensored things. Why don't they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or something. It is never the parents' fault. If people pull unsensored things out of the library, it will serve no purpose, and that's just my opinion. I know that I have no say in it, and that's okay. I can still believe that I am right. Thank you for your time. In the end, we should focus on proper parenting and education rather than simply removing potentially offensive materials from libraries.
60	3037	2	3	When you were a child, how much did you learn from books? Books are filled with great stories of far - away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings. All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive. Children have to learn these things some time in their life, and I think the earlier they learn, the less trouble it will cause them later in life. There are also freedoms in the United States that grant us freedom of speech. Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well? Authors are brilliant people. Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read. We should all respect authors and what they put into their books. This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what he or she chose to put in it. When I was a child, I picked up on everything. I was very inquisitive, as any kid my age would be. I remember wandering around my public library, scanning the rows of books and reading the titles. There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence. However, on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house. There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves! The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books. As I grew older, I began to delve into more adult books such as politics and religion. I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books. Without those books in that library, I would have never been able to research those topics. There is an amendment in our Constitution of the United States that promotes freedom of speech in the United States. This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the rights of anybody else. The definition of a library is a place where people can read and check out books from the library and return them when they please. Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value. Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them. Some books may have material that might not belong in the hands of children. Children need to learn those things sometime in their life. Why not now? Books are what have taught all of us. Please let them keep teaching. By protecting the integrity of library collections, we safeguard the right to knowledge and the ability to form independent thoughts and opinions, which are essential for a healthy and informed society.
61	3038	2	3	Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a specifically designated section made for adult readers only. This way, no children would come across the book anyway. If an offensive book is placed in a school or any other place where the majority of readers are children, then it should be acceptable to take that book off of the shelf. All in all, it should be okay to remove an offensive book from a shelf, but only if the book is offensive to the wrong audience. In conclusion, a balanced approach that considers the appropriate readership is crucial when dealing with offensive books.
62	3039	2	3	I think that everyone's opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library. Do I believe that certain books should be removed from the library? Yes and no. The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are extremely helpful to others for their class and their research for whatever class they need it for. For instance, a specialized historical book can be a valuable resource for a history project. Another reason why I say no is because of the fact that if the book offends you, then simply don't read the book or dwell on what it says; just leave it alone. The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards others that are referring to the people it's talking about, then yes, it needs to be removed before others start using those kinds of hurtful words towards their peers or their elders. If the book contains racial slurs directed at different races, then yes, they need to be removed as soon as possible. If others get a hold of these kinds of books, then everyone would use them against each other, which in result would cause an outbreak of fights, people arguing with each other, and just pure hate between those people using it against the different races. These are my opinions of removing some books that contain hurtful things or meanings in them that can involve violence or call another person out by their name or race. In conclusion, a careful assessment of a book's content and its potential impact is necessary when deciding on its removal.
63	3040	2	3	Should censorship be used on library books? Obviously, if you are talking to an adult, then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be exposed to inappropriate words. But if you ask any student the same question, you will probably get mixed answers. Some might say, 'I don't appreciate hearing or reading those words,' while others might say,'sure, why not? I hear them on television, see them on the internet, and my parents say them, so why can't I read them.' To me personally, I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on the shelves in a middle school's library or lower. For high school and up, I think that it's okay to have them in magazines, books, music, and movies. When I was a child, my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an environment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after a while, it comes out like normal words. So why not have it in the books and movies? It's not like we don't know what the words mean. If they hurt your feelings, then you know not to read, listen, or watch it again. I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's okay for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you. In some cases, cuss words are good for a story. Sometimes when you're reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it until the argument is over, but sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say, 'Hey, something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' The use of such words catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened. Consequently, movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language do have an affect on our youth. A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but that's just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someone's attention. Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting. So again, I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music, or magazine. Choose it because it looks interesting and it's something you might enjoy. In conclusion, while foul language has an impact on youth, censorship should not be the main determinant in media selection.
64	3041	2	3	There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children. There is a lot of material out there, whether it's books, movies, or other things that have a bad influence on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences. First, children watch movies and they see two people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children? Then the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnancies have skyrocketed. High schools are filled with pregnant teens. Anywhere you go, I guarantee you will see a pregnant teen. Some girls even get pregnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. There's a way; don't let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted. Secondly, there are books, movies, and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well, the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is okay and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's okay to do things like that. There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become serial killers or go on a shooting spree at school. Is that not enough evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong? We need to take immediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone. Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch TV or play video games. Their laziness causes obesity. There are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid overweight for many reasons. Children being obese causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self - esteem. The child then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases, the child tries to commit suicide because other children are teasing them in school every day. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see what's happening before it's too late. In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophes, there has to be change. There are many harmful and bad influences out there today that can determine the children's futures. There is still time for change, so let's do something about it. Let's try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influential video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day, get up, go outside, and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for the better.
65	3042	2	3	I truly think that books should not be censored. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that don't offend at least one person or a group of people. Books are an important part of the learning system. If a certain book offends you, then you simply have to move on. That's that simple. There is no need to over - react to words on paper. Besides, there are more important issues at the moment. While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or guardians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see, if people can live with that, then we can definitely handle an offensive book. Censorship causes blindness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book, then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book. If a book offends you that much, then listen up, just move on! Just because a book is offensive to you doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone. Sometimes a history book could be considered offensive, so we censor it, and then we won't learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them. The point is, if a person can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper. In conclusion, censorship of books is not a viable solution as it can prevent learning and is an over - reaction to potential offense.
66	3043	2	3	This is what's wrong with today's society. We are far too soft. We're overly worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person who doesn't care about other people's feelings, to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's a completely different story. I show a great deal of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I couldn't care less about their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life. Maybe we should stop constantly worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race. Has anybody ever thought of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from life's normalcies. They've got to learn at some point. Life isn't all lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it can really kick you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc., won't and isn't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Every time I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made-up word that really means we care about other people's feelings more than we do our own. In the end, we should embrace the realness of life and stop being so overly cautious about what others might think.
67	3044	2	3	I don't believe in the censorship of libraries. After all, we're in @CAPS1, a free country, and we have the right to have access to the material we want from libraries. It doesn't matter if it's age-appropriate or not. If you don't want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie, then it's your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them. Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that comes with living here. If we allowed anyone to censor a library, then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote clearly shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf, we wouldn't have any books left. Censorship would just be the start. It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know, which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1. We wouldn't be free. Censorship of libraries would take away our rights, which is why I oppose it. In conclusion, we must safeguard the freedom of access to library materials to maintain the essence of our free society.
68	3045	2	3	Should books, magazines, music, movies, and so on be censored for certain age levels? No, they shouldn't. Books can be extremely educational. Sometimes, you can hardly find a book without some so - called 'bad things' in them. Even if they do contain such elements, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country. Books can't be censored from children. Why, you ask? Because the main reason people read books is to learn. To learn about love, math, history, and much more. These books are written by adults, not just for adults, but for everyone to read. I read lots of books, and every book that I read, I learn something new. Back in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cursing was quite common in books. But it wasn't just for the sake of cursing; it was to show the full dialogue of the character. It also set the mood of the era, and the place where the story is being held. For example, in war books, the characters curse a lot. The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was, '@CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would really act. The man would curse quite a bit. Not literally, but when the author writes what someone would truly say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book. As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is indeed true. It's true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in. Right? I myself strongly believe that everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that. So should books in a library be censored? No, definitely not. It's the best way for people to learn what life is really like. Sometimes, you can learn a great deal without reading a book with curse words, sex, or violence. People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age. But it won't; it will only show them how not to act. And it can only create a better - informed person. In summary, we should let books be a true reflection of life and not censor them.
69	3046	2	3	I believe if the books, music, movies, magazines and so on are offensive and bad, they should be removed, mainly because of younger children. Younger children should not be exposed to that kind of stuff if it's inappropriate or not relevant to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and such that are bad and offensive, I would suggest having a special room or some sort of area where they can be kept and where only adults can access them. Movies and magazines are my biggest concerns. There are more inappropriate elements in them than in books or music. Books and music may have bad language, but very rarely have bad images or other such disturbing content. If there happens to be a book, music, movie, or magazine that you or any other person thinks is inappropriate or offensive, then you or that person should have the permission to take it off the shelf and show it at the main desk, and let the staff know what you think about it. I feel that they should separate the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. They should still allow the presence of censored books, music, movies, and magazines because adults can handle that kind of material while younger children can't. So, by keeping everything separate, there shouldn't be any problems. In the end, proper separation and censorship management in libraries can ensure a safe and appropriate reading environment for all.
70	3047	2	3	Many people are very firm about their thoughts when they believe in something very strongly. In other people's eyes, you'll @MONTH1 find some who disagree and some who agree with you, often due to having similar life experiences. All of people's opinions are shaped by life experiences and the many tragedies they have been a part of. You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with are nothing compared to what others are going through, and that you should enjoy every moment you can. Opinions are often changed about many different things. Being a homosexual is one of the many topics that people debate about most frequently. In my opinion, it doesn't really matter whether you're homosexual or not. You have to understand that everyone is different in their own way. Acceptance is the key to making everyone get along at some point, but unfortunately, people still struggle with homophobia. Another big debate that many people have is between female and male opinions. It seems as if they don't get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other. It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agrees with you @PERCENT1, unless they're pretending to be something they're not. From life experiences like parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives' disputes, you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to be a gift and should be cherished every day. All in all, I believe that most books are based on reality and other people's visions of the world and what they see. I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get their point across. It helps others get a clear picture of who they are and what they go through. In conclusion, we should respect different opinions and try to understand the diverse experiences that shape them.
71	3048	2	3	I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes perfect sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books, especially those in @MONTH1, seem bad at first glance, but when you think about it there is always a valuable lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine. Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On numerous occasions he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to handle. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book. When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was extremely curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning. After several hours of sitting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally managed to talk him into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he completely lost track of time. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried. He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had no other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him in the left side of his car. After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well. Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in each book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in real - life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things. Even what to do and what not to do. If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read. This shows that books, regardless of their content, can have a positive impact on our lives and should be available in libraries.
72	3049	2	3	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, I firmly think they should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people. Some can be a bad influence on younger kids. Some can be offensive to someone's race or religion. It could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do. Some materials should be removed because of the kind of influence they have on younger kids. Some books can have extremely violent language and actions in the book. Most magazines have inappropriate articles that kids should not be reading or even looking at. The music nowadays is very explicit and definitely does not need to be in the hands of kids. Some parents don't even care about the music but it is one of the biggest influential things out there. So that's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. There are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religions. Hip @CAPS1 is one of the most explicit kinds of music and is very offensive to all kinds of religions and some races of people. Movies are the same as music in this regard. Magazines have certain articles that are blatantly racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions. A lot of magazines have stories about celebrities that are very bad, sad, and private. In the past there have been some celebrities that sued some magazines and newspapers that put the wrong story out or something too private out. Those are just some ways and reasons why certain books, movies, music and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No one truly knows how people feel about themselves or things around them. We should be more cautious about what is made available in public spaces to avoid causing harm and offense.
73	3050	2	3	NO, I don't think music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be moved from libraries because what's a library with only books? Even though you have to read quietly and be seated, you can have music while on the computer and you can watch and check out movies you particularly like. And the magazines can keep you updated with the newest fashion, new looks, or something that's going on in our community. Music is what you want to listen to when you come to the library. It smoothes up the vibe and if you are in a bad mood, that music you like can calm you down and put you in a better one. It relaxes you. You can be on the computer and still listen to music. While reading a good book you can be listening to music. Movies are a great source when in the library. You can watch movies while in the library and check some out to take home and watch. You can watch all types of movies. Movies you really like and it also can be movies you need for a project or even educational movies. If you want to learn about nature, animals, or even a @CAPS1 person from the @DATE1, it's always good to have a movie in the library. Magazines in a library are very helpful. Because while you might be waiting on something or it could be while you're on the computer, you can sit and grab a magazine. In the library, there's a variety of magazines you can read like sports, fashion, nature, cartoon, animals and etc. So magazines are very helpful in a library. That's why I say no, because it shouldn't be removed from libraries because you can do lots of great things in the library besides just reading a book and getting on a computer. Movies, magazines, and music are helpful in a library too. Who just wants to get on a computer and read a book? '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. These additional forms of media enhance the library experience and make it a more diverse and useful place for everyone.
74	3051	2	3	The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they are deemed to be offensive. There are many ways to approach this question. Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without fully understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work. Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access. I believe it is the responsibility of the parent to determine such restrictions. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided. I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author. My creations are expressions that I give for the world to enjoy and think about. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets. There are a couple of complications that will arise in censorship on libraries. What guidelines do you have in determining excluding the offensive materials? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine what's offensive and what's not. In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability to acquire whatever material they want from a library. It is an institution that allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live. Its ability to do such should not be compromised as it is a fundamental part of the library's role in society.
75	3052	2	3	In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover. It was rather large, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for it. The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensely. Although, there were some parts of the book that had me completely confused. There were scenes involving women that I did not understand, and many new words. Eventually, I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book. He read the passage, and his eyes went wide. I never finished that book. There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, but, as my dad obviously thought, it probably should have been a little too much for that time in my life. If it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a little chat with that library. Now that I am old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocence because of it. There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries. Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems absurd considering my experience. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing; it should not be from some fiction book. I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries. The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, movies have up to @NUM1 ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references. Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves. As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book. Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocence for a little bit longer, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth. I would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect today's children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world. By implementing proper censorship, libraries can become safer and more suitable environments for children to explore knowledge.
76	3053	2	3	Have you ever noticed how much bad materials, such as inappropriate movies, vulgar books, trashy magazines, offensive music, or even some questionable content on @CAPS1, are out there for children to get a hold of? It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show? I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.   In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, it's going to bring out some violence between some people. Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels. That is how @CAPS3 even came to be. So take away something from people, they are going to stand up and fight for it. There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completely.   If you take away all the bad materials, it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech. Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid of it. It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by. If we do take away all the offensive materials, we should take away everything. So what is the point? We all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone. In taking away all the offensive materials, you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.   Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was. If you're a parent, it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is. So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it. It will still be around. It is just something in our world that we have to live with. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the right of freedom of speech while guiding children to make proper choices.
77	3054	2	3	Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? @CAPS2, which can include various forms of media like controversial books, edgy music, or thought - provoking movies, is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into:   If one person finds a @CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should @CAPS2 be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some people's opinions. This is because they know people like @CAPS2 and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find @CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have @CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item.   If the library removes the offensive item, they @MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they @MONTH1 lose a customer. So they are faced with a dilemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' @CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they @MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They @MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they @MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they @MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if @CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love @CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy @CAPS2 at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' @CAPS3 is they just don't want to acknowledge other people's choices, feelings, opinions, etc.   So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for @CAPS2 to be removed? Say nothing? @CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision. We should strive for a balanced approach that respects everyone's rights and preferences in the library environment.
78	3055	2	3	If you were offended by a book in the library, would you want it taken off the shelf? I wouldn't. There is no point in removing it. There are a lot of books that can offend people, and that one book isn't just towards you. The same goes for movies and music.   Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people. Some people @MONTH1 not find the same thing offensive like you do because everyone doesn't think alike. If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them, then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today. This is a free country and we have the right to speak and write about whatever we want to get out.   Movies are another way of getting your emotions out or expressing yourself. People find most movies offensive, but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it. We are able to express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies. No one or no race is the center of attention in movies. People @MONTH1 feel as if they are, but that's a personal thing people @MONTH1 go through.   Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people. Music @MONTH1 be found most offensive nowadays, but music is also a way of getting emotions and freedom of speech out. I've never felt offended because of a song I've heard or anything. People are going to say what they feel and want.   Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world. People either gotta get used to it or stay offended. Books, music, movies, or magazines won't be pulled because of emotions. I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things. We should embrace this diversity of expression and not let our personal sensitivities limit the creative output of others.
79	3056	2	3	Many books and material in libraries are sometimes offensive to certain people, but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves of libraries. Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable interest for another person. If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away, then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like, like science. If it is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special section, be available behind the counter, or available only at specific libraries.   Throughout the libraries of the world, there are two general sections, adult, kid, and entertainment sections. In these sections, there are many topics and many views of certain things. Sometimes it is very offensive and it is almost 'hidden' from view and you have to spend all day looking for it. It should be that controversial topics should be kept in a closed - off section of the library and can be accessed by the staff so that way none of the public can worry.   Like cigarettes at a store, some things should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchful eye over it. These subjects include sex, racism, porn, politics, and other material like the ones listed. With these items behind the counter, people will not know about it and it will be hidden from view, but still accessible with special order or request. This would help the public.   Some material, when reached to a specific town, can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community. Some material should be denied from entering small towns and the specified material can only be acquired at large libraries or specific book stores. With material far away, people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community. This is why some material should only have permitted access under watchful guard. By implementing such measures, we can balance the need for access to information and the protection of the public from offensive content.
80	3057	2	3	I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way I look at it is that everyone has their own beliefs, rights, and their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike.   As an example, some people are against blacks and others are not. Everyone thinks differently and has their own opinions. Therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever they want.   Not everyone is going to like what you like, listen to, and believe everything you do. Don't read it if it offends you, but just because it offends you doesn't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it. We should respect the diversity of opinions and choices in a free society, and not let personal sensitivities lead to the removal of materials that others value.
81	3058	2	3	All throughout the world there are libraries. Libraries have all different kinds of materials, like books, magazines, and newspapers, stacked upon shelves. Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not. I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, I understand some of this material might be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this. If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, etc., I think they should be able to keep them. Just because some people do not like that material does not mean everyone won't like it. Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions. Isn't that what makes the world go around? Adults might have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library. I understand their concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material. If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries, I think there should be a blocked - off room where kids can't go. That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not. We go to school for a vast amount of reasons. Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent. While we are at school, not only are we learning things like math and evolution, but we are also learning what's going on in the world around us. If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies. We, as children and teenagers, see and hear about this every day. Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it? There is a lot of different kinds of material in libraries. Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate. I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it. I think as long as it's blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their freedom in stocking materials, and with proper segregation, the concerns of both material lovers and parents can be addressed.
82	3059	2	3	Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are offensive to people's beliefs, their religion, their race, and just their ways of life. Therefore, I do not believe that books in libraries should be censored. I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was discriminating someone else's beliefs but not yours. Would that still be okay with you to take those books off of the shelves? Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age - appropriate. If you do not want your child learning about them, do not let them get it. You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book. There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive. Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything. The things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world. So if anything, the books that might be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says. As far as movies, they are already rated on a decent scale. If it is not age - appropriate, then do not watch it, or let your children. The same applies for video games and music. Censor them from your children, and do not get them censored from the whole world. That is my opinion about censoring things from libraries. Just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes, does not mean that someone else in the world does not. Out of all the things that need to be censored, the library is not one of them. Of all the places, taking things off of the library shelves is not going to do justice to what really needs to be done. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place of free access, and personal censorship at the individual level is a more reasonable approach.
83	3060	2	3	Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being what may be offensive to you might not be to someone else. In this society we live in, we shouldn't go based on one's opinion because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History shows that many different people found different things to be offensive. For example, some people think that books that have content about gays shouldn't be in libraries, but many feel otherwise. That's a good example of how people have different opinions. The next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others about many different things. The libraries, being a place to study and learn, should have a wide variety of different things even if some take offense to it. In fact, some books teach us that we shouldn't get offended because that's what one person feels, and as long as you've got someone who loves you, it doesn't matter. The last reason being if we all just removed things we don't like, the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give their own point of view. If you dislike it, don't take offense to it and try to remove it from the shelves. The country has a government where they take everybody's opinion. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue. We shouldn't just remove the school because someone doesn't like it. In conclusion, certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it might not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed things we dislike, the world wouldn't be the way it is. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the value of all materials in libraries.
84	3061	2	3	Dear Katherine Paterson, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I honestly don't think that's necessary because not everybody might find those materials offensive. If a couple of people think that a certain book or something is offensive, then don't read it or pay attention to it. Don't take something from someone that they like. I think that if there were people that found a certain topic interesting and there were also people who found it offensive, that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it. Either way, I think that they shouldn't remove those materials, unless everyone agrees that it's offensive. That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic, just because one person found it offensive. Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that, then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that, I see no reason why you should take away something that some people might enjoy. Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food. Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else. That's just their opinion on things and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it. Well, those are my thoughts on whether or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive. My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you, don't read it or have anything to do with it. Other than that, you shouldn't take materials away from people unless everyone agrees on it. In conclusion, the decision to remove offensive materials should be based on a broad consensus, and individual preferences should not dictate the access of others. Sincerely, @PERSON2.
85	3062	2	3	Many people have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. It depends on one's beliefs and morals. I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries. I think that people should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe. It also depends on a person's age and maturity level. Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. The situation is different for each person. It's hard to judge certain materials because some people might find it acceptable while others might not. There would be controversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable and what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to people. If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out. I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. For example, materials can be categorized by maturity level. That's what movie ratings are for. Materials should be organized so that people can easily see if they would be offensive or not. For example, all the kids' movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate. It should be obvious to people who would find it offensive and who wouldn't. People should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. That being said, certain things can be done so that people would know if something would be offensive or not. In conclusion, while maintaining the freedom of access in libraries, proper categorization can help balance the diverse views of people.
86	3063	2	3	How would you feel if you painstakingly wrote a story about your life, and then someone found it offensive, so they promptly took the book off of the shelves? I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a highly controversial problem for the following reasons: it is fundamentally wrong to take away freedoms, people hold different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are actually trying to make people aware of potential dangers. One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is; it blatantly takes away our freedom of speech. In @LOCATION1, we firmly have the right to speak our minds freely. If everything we read was heavily censored, there would practically be nothing worthwhile to read. The precious liberties and freedoms of @CAPS1 citizens should not be callously taken away because of something that is merely thought to be inappropriate. Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is; different people have completely diverse opinions on things. One person might strongly feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might sincerely think the book is highly informational and extremely helpful. No one can reasonably base censorship on one single belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone whole - heartedly approves of. A third reason why censorship should not be enforced as much is; it takes away the crucial awareness of the dangers in everyday life. Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a truly good thing. Even though the story @MONTH1 have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influential, and effectively convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person. Although stories or magazine articles that @MONTH1 be seen as vulgar are often looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be completely abolished.
87	3064	2	3	I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand, I do not believe that anything racist should be on library shelves. Teens these days earnestly want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually closely relate to, and the same thing goes for a movie, music, and a magazine. You simply can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movies or any of that kind of stuff, so that wouldn't be something I'd pick out to watch. On the other hand, I don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because I don't like it. Also, something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, I don't think that it should be removed from shelves just because of the title. Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it, but I don't think it should be removed because that's what a lot of people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about things they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to, hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music, but a @NUM1 - year - old doesn't want to go around listening to Barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand, others @MONTH1 not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because it's bad for you. If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like, they would be really frustrated and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather foolish. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to conform to a single standard.
88	3065	2	3	From my own careful observations, I do not believe that any materials should be removed from libraries. All students have the fundamental right to read and learn about different subjects. Even if that includes some of them being potentially offensive. Some subjects might be considered offensive, like the Holocaust for example. If we didn't thoroughly learn about what happened during that horrific time, it could possibly happen again without us even being aware that it has happened before. But it is the students' choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is considered offensive. In conclusion, I do not believe that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves. People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well - rounded individual. By having access to a wide range of materials, students can develop critical thinking skills and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
89	3066	2	3	I do think that there should be a censorship not just in libraries, but everywhere. Personally, I think that the way that the libraries have the books arranged is appropriate. If the parents do not want their children going anywhere that is not suitable for them, they should keep a close eye on them. As for the parents, they know the area that interests them. Therefore, the parents should guide their children to the relevant sections. Censorship can help create a more suitable environment for everyone, especially for the younger and more impressionable minds. It ensures that the materials available are in line with the general moral and ethical standards of the community. In this way, libraries can continue to serve as a valuable source of knowledge while also protecting the well - being of their patrons.
90	3067	2	3	How would you feel if you were at your local library and you unexpectedly found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone, and anyone could casually see the material. Libraries should make sure there isn't anything offensive in their materials before they carefully put them on the shelf. Everyone has easy access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people precisely know what is offensive and what isn't? Libraries shouldn't have such easily accessible offensive material. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a clear warning on it or be placed on a high shelf. Libraries should be acutely aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not. Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them, but sometimes they can quickly pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might curiously grab it and see what's in it. Most libraries have a children's section where you can generally trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the children's section, so there shouldn't be offensive material in libraries or at least within children's reach. Lastly, libraries choose what they put on the shelves and they never precisely know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff, then anyone can see it, and it could put a negative thought in some people's heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material, but there are others who can't. Those that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offensive material in libraries. In @CAPS1, libraries should not supply offensive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff, there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it, and you don't know how it will affect them. If there is going to be offensive material in your library, there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter. If there is something offensive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day libraries will completely eliminate them to create a more suitable and positive environment for all patrons.
91	3068	2	3	I believe that if there are offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the libraries, which might contain inappropriate language, explicit content, or controversial themes, I think they should be taken off the shelf. After all, people should not want their children reading or looking at things they should not be looking at. Today I'm going against the views on the censorship in the libraries. I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the building for our children to read. The materials that the libraries have that are offensive should be put up in another area for older people. Not for the children who go to the libraries. I'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on their shelves for our young people and our children. And what types of books should be in the children's part in the libraries on the shelf. We should have rights to take off books on the children's side. And have rights to put offensive materials on the side for older people who like books, music, movies, and magazines but not for young children to read. The point I'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children should learn. And what they should know as a young person. They should not grow up too fast like some people are. We need to make it better for our young children so they can do the same for themselves and for their children some day. This way, we can create a more suitable and healthy reading environment for our children.
92	3069	2	3	If you walk into a store and see a book you don't like or a magazine you couldn't care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the library's books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you don't like it don't buy it or look. When I was in the eighth grade, I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There were a lot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others, we would leisurely walk around and do some shopping. There were a lot of people in this city and it was always packed. Now with that being said, there were a lot of different stores and there were some, in my opinion at the time, that I thought were very inappropriate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didn't belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store it was. Our actions simply involved politely nodding our heads goodbye at the cashier and walking out, continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. The reason being is that that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there, other people walked into that store and liked what they saw. If we would have removed those items, they wouldn't have got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like, meaning I'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that. If you walk into a store and see something you do not like, you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not, you just can't do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you. You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like to. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive, other people might like. That goes for the opposite too; what other people find offensive, you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops. So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks into the same store and takes something off the shelf that they thought was offensive. Now there are two things gone from the shelf, but you actually liked what they took off the shelf and you're upset that they took that off. This will cause a lot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it, one person doesn't. If you don't like what you see in a store, then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you. These are some of my opinions about this category. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores' products. Always be aware of what you're getting yourself into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause a lot of lost jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said. By respecting the diversity of store offerings, we can maintain a more harmonious shopping environment.
93	3070	2	3	Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for. These resources can cover a wide range of knowledge and interests, from history and science to literature and art. I don't think that libraries include anything offensive. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution. It shouldn't be removed because not everyone @MONTH1 find it offensive. I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books and things for you to do there. I've actually gained a lot of knowledge at the libraries I've been to because I found so many books that were just amazing. These books have broadened my horizons and deepened my understanding of the world. Never have I run into something that was offensive to me or anyone else. Everyone is different though; we all have a different view on things and we all are unique. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone, then maybe it should be removed, but like I said earlier, if it's not offensive to everyone, then it shouldn't be removed. I personally think libraries hold so many unique things that if something were offensive to people, then I'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, I find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to', I would say, 'well, that @MONTH1 be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldn't be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it. Now, from my experience, there are a lot of things that people find offensive, but personally, I think it would be outside of a library. We should respect the diversity of materials in libraries to ensure that everyone can find something useful and interesting.
94	3071	2	3	Definitely not, they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be exposed to offensive material sometime in their life, so there is no real reason to censor materials. These materials are made to entertain someone, and some are entertained by offensive material. I honestly don't think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be taken out. If any material offends you, you don't have to acknowledge it; you can always check out different material. If you censor material, then you are going against the first amendment, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored. What happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, that's what. Books are made by the author writing down his ideas and creating a plot. Some will think his ideas are offensive, but not all will. Whether people think it's offensive or not, people still enjoy those books. Anyone can create material and share their ideas. Those ideas could still be offensive, but it doesn't matter because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it. If you ban any type of material, you're prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all you're doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment and being a hypocrite. Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music, you're also censoring out their ideas. Music is an expression of life, and censoring that would be like censoring emotion. Censorship of the movies, music, and books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture. All I'm saying is that censorship is destroying America and hurting our progression in culture. We should uphold the principles of free expression to foster a more vibrant and diverse cultural environment.
95	3072	2	3	Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelves? Well, if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive, then there wouldn't be anything there to read. If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you, then don't read it; grab a new one. Throughout this article, you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraries shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic. Movies, books, magazines, and music can be offensive. If you think about it though, if you get offended, then don't read, listen, or watch it. You just simply have to grab a new book. Now the question comes, what if it's the best book or movie out there? If that's the case, then watch it, but just know it's your own choice to. If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves, then grab one that really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. If he/she doesn't see a problem with it, tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it. After you get done with that, ask him/her for a stack of the books, etc., that offend you. That's when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her. The libraries, on the other hand, if you're getting bombarded with people coming in and saying this book offends me, I can't believe this is on your shelves, what if a little kid got a hold of this...! Managers or owners, if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie, what do you do? In my opinion, I'd read or watch maybe the first two or three, but after that, I'd start playing it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office. Now you've got to think, man, if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive, then you really got to take action. If you take books away from the libraries, then you lose sales. I've been to a library where everything was categorized so people know what they're looking through before they start reading, which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves. My belief on the topic is that you go into a library knowing what's in a library, books! Now if you go in there and there's a book or movie that a lot of people complained about, then I'd see them making an effort to get rid of it. But if you're the only one, then I highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it. You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you; they're not singling you out. If it's that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off, then take it back and grab a new one. If that book or movie is their best - seller, they're not going to destroy it because of one single person. So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing what it's about, then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it; it's your choice not theirs. This article took a lot of different sides, which is good in a way because it's not just about one single topic. However, if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it, then go to a different library. Maybe that library won't have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about, and if there is, maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you. So if you read this article and get offended by it, then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems. Thanks for reading. By approaching the issue of offensive materials in libraries rationally, we can strike a balance between individual sensitivities and the overall availability of resources.
96	3073	2	3	What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion, I firmly believe that forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the very essence of the people who created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar - coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the opportunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual.   With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and the heartfelt dedication that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self - expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is therapeutic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was deemed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken aback? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art, there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, 'Who deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today, there will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type?   Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored, how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down - time reading to one person might be the very thing that strikes a world - changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their lifetime and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored, individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion - based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the organization's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the specific group and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succession from the location. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the organization, it created a hatred and false sense of the group in the children's eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child who is only a few years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship, we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it.   The biggest thing about censorship is the cover - up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publicly display a controversial topic, no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art, should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library might decide to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually, the world will have no art left because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarantee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar - coated or portrayed as perfect because that is not life. Everyone will struggle at some point, and it's works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them, or in my case, art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual who they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public; it will just destroy an opportunity to grow.   Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public because they are not the public. Every person holds their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art, you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue, our planet will become a place full of mindless zombies with no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruining the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality from the world. Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. The struggles of one person might be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow.
97	3074	2	3	Several years ago, a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The specific book, her child was about to read for his English class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth - grader to read. She was within her rights to be a little nervous about the book, as there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the curriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because, even though the appropriateness of one scene might have been in question, the rest of the book taught lessons that were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the importance of right and wrong, and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong.   Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the harshness of the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something along the lines of understanding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inappropriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view might one day lead to the solution of problems in our world today, such as the crisis in the location involving the specific groups.   I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike, we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, YouTube. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video, there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or disliked said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site, it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch.   Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly become very boring. During the women's suffrage movement, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now, after many years, it is seen as a commonplace thing, and it is now a legal right for women to vote. This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves, we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant.   All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freedom of speech in the First Amendment. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech?
98	3075	2	3	The old saying one should never judge a book by its cover comes into literal meaning with this particular subject. Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is. One person might look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others might not have the same point of view. However, in my personal opinion, books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lying between the pages. With over a billion different points of view residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select people find inappropriate be removed?   Every person has their own life story and rough experiences. Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever. While reading a book, a viewer might skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them. For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim. I do not believe victims of abuse, no matter what degree, should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure. However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person.   Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who cannot yet handle that topic. At a young age, I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story. Mid - way through, I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped. As a sixth - grader, I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject. For weeks, I walked the halls scared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read. Books with mature topics should be separated from those for younger children because the description in a book might leave a child with emotional scars.   Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book might contain would help this issue tremendously. If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material. If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they might be about to view. By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world a lot of harm.   If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, there won't be many books left to read. Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently. By monitoring and labeling books, bookworms will be able to make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them. So, in conclusion, don't take away the wonders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.
99	3076	2	3	Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all, a person doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also, if the librarian should know what's appropriate for the library, and items like the ones that offend people should not even be in a public area.   A person doesn't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study, and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library as a resource should not find themselves in a situation where they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie, or magazine because of what the author says in the writing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.   Also, the librarian is in charge of the items he wants to display in his library. If the librarian feels that a book is okay to be displayed, he can display it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study, the librarian should keep it in an area where people that want the book can ask for it.   Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offensive literature, music, movies, etc. in libraries. Nowadays, people are allowed to donate items of literature or entertainment to libraries, but I think that people should make sure that the items they are donating are okay to be displayed.   So, yes, I believe that offensive materials should be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places where you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be in charge of what he or she wants to display. And last, stuff like that should not even be in a public area. By removing offensive materials, libraries can maintain a positive and inclusive environment for all visitors, ensuring that
100	3077	2	3	It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time.     My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' by @PERSON1. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the @LOCATION4 during the earlier years of the @LOCATION1. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern @LOCATION1; one could say this book steriotypes people in the @LOCATION4. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-@CAPS6 could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the @LOCATION1 and the rest of the world. I grew from reading @PERSON1's masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the @LOCATION1 has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed.     Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; @CAPS9 or @CAPS10'ite, @LOCATION2, @CAPS11, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION5, @CAPS12. Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth.     In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be. It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.
101	3078	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Most of the people create books that are inappropriate or offensive, and sometimes these books are based on the author's life or some experiences they have lived through. However, the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't think that these are real experiences of a person and can be a source of inspiration for the future of more people. People sometimes like to be the best and can create problems with others, and that makes them happy, which is a sad thing because it's bad behavior. Also, they can go so far as to do things so bad that they end up in jail. These are some of the experiences that people share in these materials, but others misinterpret them. Well, that's their problem; they can do whatever they want. I know that life is not easy, but thanks to that material, we can have a better life and also defend ourselves. Also, I don't think that those books or magazines need to be removed because that's what helps us to have a better life and also in the future. They need to stay on the shelves, and if people find them offensive, they can just avoid them. More people like those materials and think they are helpful for them and for me. I don't think that there will be truly bad or inappropriate materials in a place where a lot of people go, not only adults but also children. And that would be even more inappropriate for kids. People are aware of what's going on, and some others know too. The world can sometimes be dangerous, but it also helps us to grow up, which is a good thing. We have the choice if we want to read or access that information. I remember one time when I read a book that was kind of sad, but it helped me to understand our life better. It was about two boys. The book had a lot of bad words and talked about some really tough things, but that also explained the story better and we learned more from it. That's how some of these materials can help us with life. One of the books, magazines, music, movies, etc., that we can create is our own life story because we go through a lot of difficult times, and that can be an inappropriate book of our life. People like me are grateful to those who publish their experiences and at the same time help us. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of materials available and not rush to remove them just because they might be offensive to some.
102	3079	2	3	I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media should be allowed to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask ourselves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as the history of slavery, the development of automobiles, and other important aspects? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just downright boring? Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We may have the right to take down the books, but there is no good reason to do so. It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of information that our children should know about, such as the history of slavery and the lives of famous people. What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other than the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about it; if we took all of the books that were considered inappropriate off the shelves of the library, there wouldn't be many books left. Every book out there has something that some people might consider bad, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids' books. Who would want to go to the library and sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell you who doesn't want to do that. Nobody. It's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are really old and have different preferences, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids, and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books away, they can't. We don't need to take any books out of the libraries. There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books because there wouldn't be any good ones left. We are just taking away something that is really important to us, and without those books, there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days of our world, and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do, so why take them? In conclusion, keeping these diverse materials in libraries is essential for the growth and knowledge of our society.
103	3080	2	3	I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic. I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of a large percentage of the books I've read because... well, I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my time. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is a shame because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring, and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen. Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then, you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel when reading a great book). These are the books I remember. These 'life - changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as inappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book might talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently, it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed from the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer. Books all go through a long, drawn - out process before they are shelf - ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time and effort that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief. All books serve a purpose and should remain firmly on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of books and not let a few people's sensitivities limit the access to valuable literature.
104	3081	2	3	What do you want your child being exposed to? In my own opinion, I believe that offensive materials shouldn't be taken off the shelves because kids generally know what books are appropriate and inappropriate for them. This is why the library has a separate 'kids' selection away from the 'adult' selection. They are aware of their boundaries, and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything inappropriate. The library is a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out. Also, offensive materials are not just found in libraries; they can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, TV, and in video games. Anywhere you go, children are more likely to see inappropriate actions that take place. So as a parent, it's your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible. The only way a child can be exposed to this kind of content is if their parents are unattentive and irresponsible. Someday, your kids will ask questions about the kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students. Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature and clean manner. I know a lot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot to violent video games, music about drugs, alcohol, and sex. It really bothers me because when I was their age, I had no idea what these things even were or meant. It's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know these materials have a label on them saying 'Explicit Content', 'Parental Advisory' or something similar. Every time I hear a child say something about this awesome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence, etc., the children tend to get younger and younger every time. I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unnecessary stuff. In conclusion, parents should take more responsibility in guiding their children's exposure to different materials, and we should not rush to remove offensive materials from public places as long as proper guidance is in place.
105	3082	2	3	NEWSPAPER. Today, I'm going to tell you what I think about offensive materials in libraries. Offensive materials such as books, magazines, music, movies are found in libraries, and to some people, this is a concern. But to others, they can think it's perfectly okay to have them in a public place. Thinking something is offensive is just an opinion, and every person has a different perspective on things. The first thing I have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away. Some people can find these items very educational, and they might be able to relate to that book that other people would say is offensive. And if offensive materials are really bothering some people and the libraries are getting a lot of complaints, they should just make a section in the library just for the offensive books, movies, etc. So people won't have to look at those offensive materials. Another thing is that libraries are a public place, and they should have a wide range of books, movies, etc. Because not everyone likes the same thing. People have different interests and outlooks on different things. So people should just accept the things that they might not be into because other people might be really interested in that. And don't always just think about yourself; look at the big picture. So there are some of my thoughts and feelings on what I think about offensive materials in libraries. And I hope that you can see my point that I'm trying to get across. In conclusion, libraries should strive to balance the diverse needs and sensitivities of their patrons while still providing access to a wide range of materials.
106	3083	2	3	Do you believe that certain things, like books, magazines, movies, and music, need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see? No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have any uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might encounter. The staff shouldn't let the children enter the area where the uncensored materials are without a parent present. It's not anyone's fault in a sense, but the media staff that works in the library shouldn't allow the younger kids to go in that area where those things are unless their guardian is with them. Unless they specifically allow them in the area with the books, movies, magazines, etc. The kids should have a certain part of the library where they can access appropriate books. There's a lot of books that children shouldn't be able to read, but they read them anyway without adults' permission. And yes, there are some books that are appropriate for both the little ones and the big kids. Things like this are offensive to the parents. The staff just lets them read and see things like that, and the parents wonder why and how their children are learning such things. Certain things should be clearly posted to indicate what kids shouldn't be able to see, read, or do. And yes, I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read and see things they're not supposed to see. They know those things are not appropriate for them, so why would they let them watch, do, or see stuff like that? My conclusion is that yes, I think certain things that aren't supposed to be accessible for young children to see are in the wrong place. It's not right to let them see things like that. So that's why I'm writing this essay to the newspaper, arguing about what's right regarding allowing them to see uncensored things they're not supposed to see.
107	3084	2	3	Do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive? From my point of view, yes, because libraries are public, which means they are open to any and everyone. Kids could come across a photo that may not be appropriate for them. People of different religions could hear foul language, and it could give some libraries a bad image. I can relate to this because I have also heard some things that I'm not proud of, such as foul language. That affected me because when I heard it, I went around people who were positive in my life and said it to them. Of course, this could affect a child in a negative way. Kids grow up trying to be as positive as they can, at least that's what parents teach them. And if they get hooked on things they see, they will try to imitate it. From my experience, it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline. But if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects, they will learn the hard way. This is a reason I wish censorship was in our local libraries. Also, people of different religions could find it offensive. We have different consumers that walk in and out of the library every day. So when they enter, they should find it peaceful, not the opposite. For example, a Muslim could walk into the library and hear others listening to music filled with nothing but profanity. Now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and can say the library has no restrictions. At times, it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words, but the library needs to know its limits. Then, the library having a bad image is a big problem. When something gets a bad reputation, sooner or later it will not be there anymore. Meaning consumers will stop going to that library, and one thing could lead to another. For example, when you leave the library, the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library. But if problems constantly happen there, they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library. Then those numbers add up, and finally, it's gone. Now, if these offensive books are not removed, this is what can happen. Children will imitate what they see or hear, and complaints will be filed against that library. If I had a problem with the restriction levels at the library, I would just stop going. And if that library can't help it, at least have the courtesy to mark the sections of the library. This will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read.
108	3085	2	3	I believe that certain things such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf. The reason I think that they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them. If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library. I don't get offended by anything. When I am going through the library, I have seen people get offended by some of the things that they have on the shelves. Reading things and getting offended is a totally different thing. People that read things and get offended by it should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not. The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriate. It might not be good for the eyes of people. For instance, there could be some explicit images or vulgar language that might be disturbing. I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them. So that way, no one is making a big deal about what is on the shelves. This would create a more consistent and fair environment for all library - goers.
109	3086	2	3	Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be looking at or saying the things contained in those books. Some of the books could offend some people without them even realizing it. For example, there could be books with inappropriate language or themes that might not sit well with certain individuals. Parents need to watch what their kids read and watch on a daily basis. Kids need to know why they shouldn't watch those shows or read those books. Maybe if parents would closely monitor their kids, they would behave better than they currently do. Some of the books could offend people when they don't know it. No little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies. That is why I think those books should be taken out of all libraries. By removing these inappropriate books, we can create a safer and more suitable environment for children in libraries.
110	3087	2	3	AS WE ALL KNOW, ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN A LOCAL, BOOK STORAGE FACILITY, COMMONLY REFERED TO AS A LIBRARY. ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE IS IN THIS LITTLE AREA, BUT, IS SOME OF THAT INFORMATION INAPPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO BE IN A PUBLIC PLACE? MANY LIBRARIES often possess on their shelves books and magazines and even music containing explicit material, and how could you avoid it? In a modern world, there's going to be language and personal attributes that would be found offensive to old people and viewers of public broadcasting. YES, I AGREE SOME MATERIAL CAN AND SHOULD BE IN SEPARATE AREAS FROM MAINSTREAM MATERIAL, BUT ON A WHOLE, WHO CARES? I MEAN, MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE DON'T. I KNOW I DON'T. CENSORSHIP IS STUPID, BECAUSE MOST OF THE STUFF IN LIBRARIES, IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT YET, YOU WILL SOON, NO MATTER WHAT CENSORSHIP STEPS ARE TAKEN BY LIBRARY OFFICIALS. Trying to censor library materials is a futile effort as people will eventually be exposed to this information through other means. So, instead of focusing on censorship, libraries could better serve the public by providing clear guidance on the nature of different materials.
111	3088	2	3	I believe libraries should have a comprehensive collection of all types of books, diverse music, various movies, and different magazines. I firmly believe that if libraries had a limited selection, a large number of people would not frequent the library. For instance, if I needed a specific book for school and the library did not have it, I wouldn't know where else to go. A library should offer a wide variety of books; otherwise, what's the point of a library? Although some books might be too explicit for a child to read. For music, I think a library should have a restricted collection. I hold this view because a lot of music contains cursing. I don't think everyone wants to hear that kind of music in a library. I also don't think a person should be allowed to listen to music in the library as it's supposed to be a quiet place. However, those who listen to that type of music might be disappointed. Some music might be unsuitable for some children's ears. Regarding movies, I think there should be an age limit for children. It's simple: kids should only be able to watch kid - friendly movies. Teenagers should be allowed to watch both kid movies and teen - appropriate movies. Adults should be able to watch all movies. That's how it should be. For magazines, they should have every kind, from those for children to those for adults, but in distinct sections. For example, all children's magazines should be placed with the children's books, and all adult magazines should be with the adult reading materials. Some magazines are too explicit, but the library should ensure they stay in the adult section. Some books are offensive, but they are still books, and a library's purpose is to provide books. In my opinion, all kinds of books should be in the library regardless. I've never come across a nasty or explicit book. So, if anything is explicit, keep it in the adults - only section. Every book should have a place in the library.
112	3089	2	3	We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by a continuous stream of beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen television shows and movies on @ORGANIZATION1 that are treated the same way. Books and magazines are also censored in the same manner, either by blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with asterisks. A large number of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think it's not a big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway. If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published exactly as you had originally written it? Most of those creative people would, and they get angry when their work is edited. They desire their work to be heard as intended, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful parts causes the message not to be understood as clearly as it would be with those specific words. This can also lead to the original message being completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different from what it was originally supposed to convey. However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies or hear harsh words in music? Most parents would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand. Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things. In conclusion, censorship should just be ignored. Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines. Censoring things can distort the original message being presented and anger many authors and musicians. There are countless harsh things in the world; it's impossible to just edit them all out.
113	3090	2	3	They were talking about the idea of thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf. But if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - a work I detest - then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf. But then, they would have no books left on the bookshelf for any of them to read. They think that they should obtain some books that are not considered offensive. This is what they should do about books that are found offensive. If kids were reading books that the author found offensive, they should get rid of them. The books that are found offensive should not be read at all. Offensive books are really bad for you to read. Offensive books should not be anywhere near you. If you are going to read a book, do not choose one that is offensive. Non - offensive books like @CAPS1, those sorts of books are not very offensive. If books were not offensive, people would read them very frequently. If people were to read books very often, there would not be enough @CAPS1 time to do anything else. We do not deserve offensive books that have bad content in them. People deserve to have better, non - offensive books. Every day we read books, but do we know if they are offensive? If we did not know that the books we are reading were offensive, then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying. If we say stuff right out of the offensive book, we would get in severe trouble. Getting in trouble can mean facing some serious punishment. When you get punished, it could cause you to lose something, like your privileges, for a certain amount of @CAPS1. In conclusion, you understand what you can and cannot read. You also understand what to do with offensive books. You know that non - offensive books can make you learn something. You can also understand what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books. And that you can end up losing something, such as your freedom to do certain activities, for a certain amount of @CAPS1.
114	3091	2	3	"The way that books, music, etc. are made is basically tailored for specific age groups. For example, if a particular book contains profanity that some people find offensive, then they should simply ignore that book and move on to another one that is more suitable for them rather than starting a controversy over just one book. Some items will have labels like ""parental guidance"" to indicate that only a particular age group can access them. From my personal experience, this system is okay, but if it gets out of hand, I just leave it and go to the next thing. Although removing the books from the general collection might not help much because some people would like to have that book which they might not find anywhere else. The librarians can place that particular book in the older - age section of the library and keep the kids' books in the younger - age section. So, hopefully, this arrangement might help solve the problem and allow people to enjoy books, music, magazines, etc. according to their appropriate age groups."
115	3092	2	3	Do you think there should be any books, movies, magazines, etc. taken off the shelves? Well, if so, then you should read my newspaper article. I don't think there are any books, etc. that I would take off the shelves. There are many books, etc. that kids should not read, but you can tell your kids not to read them. Or, if they start to read them, you can take the book away from them. There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you, as a caregiver, can stop them from reading them. They will always try to find a way to get what they want. So, taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good because they'll find the book, movie, etc. somehow. The only way to ensure they don't access inappropriate materials is to keep a close eye on your kids and make sure they don't do the things you don't want them to do. In conclusion, taking books off the shelf wouldn't help anyone. Instead, just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you don't want them to be around. By being vigilant and guiding them, you can protect them from inappropriate content without limiting the availability of materials for others.
116	3093	2	3	If I owned or worked at a library, I would have a diverse collection of books, music, movies, and magazines that, to many people, are offensive. These items can offer different perspectives and experiences. However, I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the children's area of the library. This is to ensure that young minds are not exposed to inappropriate content. But I would have them in the adult area, where individuals can make their own informed decisions.   @CAPS5 might ask why I would keep that type of books, music, or movies. Well, because adults and older teenagers should be able to handle and act like adults when reading the book, watching the movie, or listening to music. They have the maturity to process and understand the content. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town, then I will completely remove the item from the shelf. It's that simple.  If parents get mad and angry because of these books, movies, and music, they should take responsibility. Don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them. Pick out a children's book like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, don't pick out a book from @PERSON1. Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color. Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4.  My question is, '@CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive?' @CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music. People live in different worlds even though we all live in one.  In my opinion, offensive books, music, and movies should stay in libraries. Just little and younger kids should not read, watch, or listen to them. This way, libraries can maintain their role as a place of diverse knowledge and freedom of choice while also protecting the well - being of younger patrons.
117	3094	2	3	Books, music, movies, and much more, being removed off of the shelf because no one liked them and some find them offensive does not mean to get rid of them. These items can hold unique value and perspectives. Many people enjoy them, and they could be used for school research or topics for a class. For instance, a controversial book might provide in - depth insights into a historical event that is crucial for a research paper.  First of all, I know for a fact that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother many other people. It was clearly our choice to buy the music, book, or movie. We all have different opinions on what 'good' music or movies are. I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of it because of the foul language or racial slurs, but it is our money and our decision to buy it. Many teens take the music thing out of control and turn it up so loud that it will let @LOCATION1 hear it. With all the words and comments they make in the music, I can see why adults don't want us to buy it. In respect for others, I think we can turn down the radio, don't make comments to movies, and don't be immature with the books.  Second, all the research and studying we have to do in school, it would be pointless to not be able to have books or magazines to do our research with. Nowadays, the students get to pick what they want to do a topic over. If they want to do that topic bad enough, then I am pretty sure they have the material to look up the information on that subject.  I do realize that it gets out of control with the music, movies, magazines, and books, but we know when to settle down and grow up. Teens who are going to be immature about it do not deserve to have all those things. We just have to learn to use it with respect. Just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school, believe it or not. By keeping these items, we can ensure that students have access to a wide range of resources for their educational needs.
118	3095	2	3	Yes, because what if a @NUM1 - year - old could find a book that is offensive as it talks about his race in a bad way. This could have a negative impact on the child's self - esteem and perception of the world. Now, if a man walks in and finds an offensive book about his race, he @MONTH1 take the situation to a new level. Maybe he @MONTH1 demand it to be taken off the shelf or something else. This shows that offensive content can cause real - world problems and discomfort.  If a woman walks in with her son or daughter and finds a dirty, nasty book about sex, drugs, guns, and knives. This is clearly inappropriate for young eyes.  So, yes, an offensive book should be taken off a shelf if the book or books are in a public library. The main reason the books should be taken off the shelf is that if it's a public library, a lot of kids and their parents come to read, do research, and do homework. A public library should be a safe and appropriate environment for all its patrons.  And that is why a public library should take an offensive book off their shelf to maintain a positive and suitable atmosphere for everyone.
119	3096	2	3	I believe that they need to keep everything and gain more. There is so much to learn about in the world. The more information you have, the better equipped you are to understand different aspects of life. I for one think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information. Although you can not trust everything in one magazine, you can still find many facts about what you are wanting to learn about. For example, a science magazine might have the latest research findings on a particular topic.  On the other hand, children should not be able to reach or see some of this. Some information could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about. The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids won't get in it, and we can still learn and find out new things. Not everything should be hidden. The more you know could just save the world. By having a proper system in place to manage access to information, we can ensure that both children and adults can benefit from the available resources.
120	3097	2	3	I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are a lot of parents that don't follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say screw the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, it's the parents' right to tell/show their kid about things, not the government.  I think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affect them directly, and I think we should. @CAPS5 have to follow whatever rules until they're @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3? I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I don't. Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.  For all I know, there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerful than the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that it's possible for something like this to happen.  Video games, they are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like '@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murderers.' @CAPS4 makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that.  I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all their life, and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they can't even handle @CAPS4. It's sad really to not be able to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. Just because they have been kept away from all that all their life.  I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad, and never watch/read @CAPS4? Where did they hear @CAPS4 from? I believe @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self. I can see the headlines now, '@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murderers.' Then they would have some made - up percentage on how many @CAPS5 turn into a murderer that watch @CAPS6 movie compared to @CAPS5 that don't.  What I am really saying is that I try not to let other people's beliefs get in my head and change my own beliefs. Even by me writing this @MONTH1 have caused someone to change their beliefs, and I really @CAPS1 hope I haven't. We should strive for a more open and logical approach to the issue of censorship, allowing individuals to make informed decisions for themselves.
121	3098	2	3	Do I believe that some books, movies, magazines, or etc., should be removed due to the fact some people might find them offensive? NO, I firmly believe that everyone should have the chance to see them, rather than just the people who did and thought they were offensive. Someone could really like a particular item, or a whole group of people could. Even if some people find an object offensive, someone else might need that object for something like school work.   Let's say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries because people find it offensive. Then a local school has a project on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now, due to somebody else's dislike of the books, these kids don't get to use those books to do their research. It simply wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just because some other people find them offensive. The library is a public place that everyone has the right to go to and borrow stuff from. So, no, I don't believe that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or etc., due to the fact that some other people find them offensive. It's important to preserve the freedom of access to a wide range of materials for all patrons.
122	3099	2	3	Twilight, Harry Potter, or even The Vampire Diaries series are books that many guardians do not allow their children to read due to their beliefs on what is real and what is not. Magic, spells, and vampires – many of us know are not real, but others do not believe in what it is that is being taught to the younger readers. My personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people having diverse interests, more variety in the available materials, and different reading or viewing materials being accessible. But there would be certain circumstances where I would have to put my foot down and censor things such as sex and drugs, just because that is not suitable for young children to be reading at that young of age.  The reason why I would have a low tolerance of the censorship is because different people like different things. If someone was an athlete, they might not find a book about cooking and cleaning very appealing. As if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either. Just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my stand - point on the censorship of certain articles. Different beliefs of certain people are understandable, but just because you don't believe it doesn't mean that everyone else is going to right there not believing it with you. Don't ruin it for the others who enjoy the interesting fact of a male vampire falling in love with a normal human girl just like you and me.  Another reason why my stance on censorship in libraries is lenient is because it would give my library more variety. If there were twenty different Harry Potter books on the shelves, many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please. Also, if you didn't know what kind of book you wanted to check out, you could look around and get a mystery, drama, comical, or even a horror book. Having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more. I know that when my library had a series of books that I found interesting, I was back in there after I finished each one.  Also, having different reading or viewing materials on hand is important in a library due to the fact that some books these days are now turned into films, which makes people more eager to finish that book in less than a week so that on the weekend they can watch the movie. Most people say that the movies are never better than the original book itself, but an opinion is easier to be based off of reading the book and then watching the movie, not just by stopping after reading the book.  In conclusion, my low - tolerance approach to censorship in libraries is based on the need to accommodate different people's interests, provide a wide variety of materials, and support the connection between reading and viewing. We should respect the diverse preferences of library users and not impose overly strict censorship standards.
123	3100	2	3	I strongly disagree. I think that materials should not be removed from the library. After all, all the materials are part of the library and are meant for the school and for us too. All the materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and CDs, should not be removed from the library. I have my own reasons why materials should not be removed from the shelf. Sometimes, when I don't find any interesting things to do, I go to my tiny library at home and pick any book that I like. But when I don't like or don't find any interesting book at home, I go to the library to find some interesting books.  However, when the libraries or the school have offensive books, magazines, movies, etc., it's a problem. That offensive stuff should be removed from the library because it's not good for the children. For example, when they want to read a book, like a cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want, they are going to get mad. And what about the parents? If they need to find some information about a book or they just want to read and they find offensive stuff, some parents are going to get mad. Not all parents, right, but some will, and they maybe won't come back again.  I've never experienced something like this in my life because in my school and the library that I go to, they don't have anything offensive or inappropriate. That's why I respect the people who work at the library and at the school because they respect us too. That's why I never go to places that I don't know. Suppose I go to a library that I don't know and I bring my parent and my little brother. If this library has offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad at me. They are going to say that I don't have respect and that I brought my brother to an inappropriate place. They are going to be mad at me for bringing my family to an offensive place, and it's not my fault, right?  In conclusion, while I believe in the importance of having a wide range of materials in the library, offensive materials should be removed to ensure a positive experience for both children and parents.
124	3101	2	3	No, I do not think that books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magazines, movies, and music should be monitored by age. The reason why is because younger children should not be reading, listening, or watching material that is intended for adults or teenagers.  The way these types of things can be monitored is by using the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth clearly printed on it. If there is a certain book, magazine, movie, or music that the child wants, a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librarian knows that the parent is of age and can make an appropriate decision about the child's access to the material.  Teenagers should also be monitored. Even though they are almost adults, some parents may not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents do not want them reading certain things, there should be stickers on their cards indicating restricted access.  In conclusion, rather than removing materials, age - based monitoring is a more reasonable approach. It allows for a balance between providing access to a wide range of materials and protecting younger users from inappropriate content. This way, we can ensure that everyone can enjoy the library's resources in a safe and appropriate manner.
125	3102	2	3	Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now, think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song.  I wholeheartedly agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children's areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as 'Playboy' do not reach their shelves.  Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands, such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consequences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think?  In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. By maintaining censorship, we can create a more respectful and appropriate environment in libraries. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment for all library users, especially the younger ones who are still developing their values and beliefs.
126	3103	2	3	I feel as though we are allowing kids these days to act as they please and do whatever they desire. We are inadvertently making them think that we don't care about what they are involved in, but that's far from the truth. We need to establish clear boundaries for what kids should and shouldn't be able to do. We need to show them that we are aware of what they're doing.  I think that there should be an age policy for libraries. If there are any books that contain any types of adult content, they should be placed in the adult section. If you ever wish to check out books, movies, or magazines from that section, you would have to be eighteen or older. If that's too much to ask for, then you should at least have the parents sign a consent form.  Books, movies, and magazines with any type of adult content can be hazardous to children, whether it affects their actions or behaviors. It can impact their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things. We need to show them that we care.  I know from personal experiences that being exposed to this kind of content can drastically change people, not over time but quickly. Nowadays, the media is portraying that money, alcohol, fame, and drugs are good things. This is what we are including in our movies, books, and magazines, and it's being instilled in the minds of children. We are giving them the impression that it's okay, but it most certainly isn't.  These are all the reasons why we should implement censorships and restrictions on libraries. We are allowing the children of today to grow up too fast and introducing them to things way too early. In a way, we are brainwashing them on how to live a destructive life through adult - oriented things. By taking these necessary steps, we can better protect our children and guide them towards a healthier and more positive future.
127	3104	2	3	The media is destroying our youth! This is a statement we hear on a daily basis. Teachers are constantly telling us this, while parents and grandparents are sharing how much different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as explicit about sex and violence. They go on to mention how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is acceptable. Because of these accounts, we tend to think that the media is responsible for the wrongdoings in the world today.  The truth is that it isn't the media's fault; it is the parents. It is the parents' responsibility to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these parents do their jobs correctly, then the youth today will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that there should not be any censorships. When there is censorship, people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes against their beliefs, and violate our God - given right to freedom of speech.  Censorship will destroy the knowledge available today. We have witnessed censorship in our history. When we look back, we see that the Nazis' censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We despised it when they had book burnings and destroyed the customs, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it? We could potentially be destroying someone's way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrow's masterpiece. In censoring, we would be destroying history. By destroying history, we would be destroying the brilliance that is learning.  If we allow censorship, anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any Christian if they would allow their children to read the Muslim book of faith, the Quran, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a Muslim if they would let their children read the Bible. The point is that if there is censorship, we would be destroying other people's beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.  Also, in censorship, we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow people to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinions and theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would have to say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech, we will not be able to stop those people who took those rights from taking more.  Of course, there will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like. There will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we don't want to see. If you don't want to see, don't look. Just don't close everyone else's eyes because you don't like what you see. We must safeguard our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech, as they are the cornerstones of a free and progressive society.
128	3105	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be a major concern. There are materials in libraries that some people find offensive. To address this problem, not everything should be censored. Why can't those who find it offensive simply avoid it? I believe it should be an individual's choice whether to read something or not. If they find it offensive, they should simply put it down.  The book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has offended many people. I have read it and was not offended. I found it to be very interesting and educational. Many people think the book should be censored. But if it is censored, the story would be completely altered, and it would lose its essence. I would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in America's history.  If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were removed from the shelves, and all the books offensive to another were taken away, what would be left? Maybe just little kids' books about kittens? Well, that's hardly sufficient.  I am strongly against censorship. I believe that if a material is offensive to you, then you shouldn't read it or listen to it. But don't ruin it for the rest of us. By respecting each other's choices and the diversity of literature, we can maintain a rich and inclusive library environment.
129	3106	2	3	The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, accessible to anyone willing to spend time exploring the rows and rows of information. It includes children's books, novels for young adults, encyclopedias, biographies, music, and movies, offering us a vast array of opportunities to discover something new. However, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can be accidentally encountered while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine with inappropriate content like this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries.  I would like to begin by stating that I have a serious issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race. Imagine if an African American woman brought her daughter of 10 years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of Martin Luther King Jr., she found a book making fun of African Americans and calling them inappropriate names. Children should not have to make such a discovery in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found, not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious emotional and mental damage to a child. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately!  Another issue I have is with sexual content in libraries. I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am referring to a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost - naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can go to a sex store nearby and satisfy their need for sexual reading. That type of book, however, should not be in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge.  Lastly, I would like to express my feelings about offensive religious comments in libraries. Every person in the United States is entitled to their own choice of religion. They can practice it freely, which is unfortunately not the case for others in different countries. If we have the uncommon right of freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions? A Jewish woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is a waste and stupid. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries!  Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand that there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship. Many people fear that once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty. Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen. This is not what I want to happen. I simply want the people of this community to consider what is easily accessible to our children. The least we can do, as parents, is to remove books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments from the libraries. By doing so, we can create a safer and more positive learning environment for everyone.
130	3107	2	3	Two of the many privileges that we have as Americans are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work may be perceived as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others may not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.  These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others may or may not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.  Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.  I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ignorant of the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries, then people, especially children, could start to think that a certain idea, that may be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, 'Those who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.  By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If these works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different. This type of literature provides useful information: it allows people to see how a large number of people thought life should have been years ago, and it teaches the people of today that it actually was how people should not be living. By keeping these materials accessible, we can ensure that future generations are well - informed and less likely to repeat the mistakes of the past.
131	3108	2	3	Libraries are well - known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about. Whether that material is a well - bound book, an engaging movie, or an interesting magazine, libraries offer a vast array of resources. Anyone can use the library, and it is a truly valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves? In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I wholeheartedly agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible.
132	3109	2	3	Katherine Paterson stated this quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I whole - heartedly agree. I feel that some of the books we have in our local libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give students and young children the wrong impact on life or their environment around them. Nowadays, what children see is sometimes what they do. So if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. An observation when I look at kids in my community playing is that they follow one another. When they're playing tag and hide - and - seek, it's evident. So movies, books, music, and magazines play a big part in the way they behave. My own experience with offensive books would be that there are books that are made by a certain author. In these books, they use cruel language, use women's body parts as symbols, and many more rude things. My little sister came across one of these books. When she asked me about it, it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading. So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book, to get any images out of her head that I felt she shouldn't have. Another experience I've seen was with my little cousin. He was looking at a magazine out of the library. The magazine was offensive to women. It was a Playboy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you've ever heard of these magazines, but I think it is very wrong that they use women's bodies for men to view. I also feel that those types of magazines should not be in a library. I believe it gives children, mainly young men, the wrong thoughts about women. My overall thoughts on censorship in libraries are that not everyone is going to feel the same way I do. There are parents that allow their children to read, listen, and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say I don't feel that is the way to go about things, because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things. I hope you take my personal experience with you and help your children read, listen, and watch age - appropriate books, music, movies, and magazines.
133	3110	2	3	Do I think that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries? No, because people might need to know a certain information, certain lessons are taught in different sources, and all sources are valuable assets. Now, you just might need certain information, and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn. For example, if I were to go in a library and need a book on religion, I would need a book or movie to teach me on that particular subject. Or even when it comes to sex - related information, I would need a magazine or movie to watch to know new information. There are different lessons taught in different aspects. For example, some people learn by example, through movies, music, and magazines. If it were to be me looking for a source on music theory, I might need one of those things to get what I need. Finally, those things are assets. Don't get me wrong; we don't need them on a daily basis in an obvious way, but in a sense we sort of do. We use search engines for everything, every day. So what do you think? In conclusion, I believe we need those sources because someone might need certain information, there are different lessons learned and taught in different things, and lastly, all sources are valuable assets.
134	3111	2	3	The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not a good thing to do. My view on the subject is that, if this begins, there will only be empty shelves in libraries across the country. Once the removing of books starts, there will be hardly any left. We use books every day. For students, we use them to learn and for entertainment during some classes. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults, some of them like to read in their free time. I think it's wrong to remove a book off of the shelf just because a few or a bunch of people think it's inappropriate. If it is, the libraries should have a section for those books that doesn't let the little kids go in that section. But there is a problem for this idea: what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nationwide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to remove or put into a special section in the libraries across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library. Another solution to this matter is that the libraries across the nation have another labeling system like the Dewey Decimal System but use both. This new system could contain information like reviews from critics about the book, or what happened during the book. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to be engrossed in for the next week or so. The books, music, magazines found in libraries should be left there for a reason. Somebody wrote or composed them for a reason, so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books, read informative magazines, and listen to good music.
135	3112	2	3	Libraries should never remove any material just because it might be found offensive. Something that is offensive to one person might not be to another. If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place. People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion. But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values. Though people's opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person. So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions. As a student, I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored. I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to. But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogatory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things. In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library, then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it. But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them. Libraries should remain a haven of free access to diverse materials for all.
136	3113	2	3	I don't believe books should be taken off of the shelves for being offensive. Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another. People, regardless of the month (@MONTH1), have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book. I understand that parents want to protect children. Parents should have in - depth conversations with their children and explain to them in detail why they don't want them reading that specific book. Parents might also just let their children read it and then patiently explain why they don't approve. I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve years old, I started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played. My mother was really concerned about the lyrical content of the songs I would listen to. She firmly refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it. I went to my friends' houses and listened to explicit music and watched rated (@CAPS1) movies. She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went. I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music, the parents should explain the reasons clearly and let them make the decision. I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child. Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer, they actually push them away. That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable with each other. In conclusion, open communication between parents and children is the key to handling the issue of offensive media, rather than strict censorship.
137	3114	2	3	Many people go to libraries; such as children, parents, and grandparents. I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community - loving place is to find peace and quiet. Some don't even go there for the books. They will engage in listening to music, flipping through magazines, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet. Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them? These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned. First of all, the libraries will lose customers. There is a large majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or (@CAPS1&@CAPS2). It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual innuendo. Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while. Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have headphones on, which isn't disruptive to others in or around the library. Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them. If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it. You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children's books you can look through. Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books. I have been to my public library many times and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes. So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes a good amount (@CAPS3) of looking, not just a quick little scan. Finally, freedom. Isn't that what (@CAPS4) is all about? The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch. I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is (@CAPS5), (@LOCATION1), (@LOCATION1@NUM1), or (@CAPS1). It also includes the not - so - nice content that will be present in the movie. So you have total freedom to purchase (check out) any of those rated movies. Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy. As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies. There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone. Libraries will lose customers, people don't have to choose the less appropriate things, and us (@CAPS7) have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch. So save yourself some time and just keep the few so - called 'offensive' materials in the library.
138	3115	2	3	There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it, wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found something that is offensive interesting, you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed. Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person, you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries, then nobody could be getting their work done. Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the (@PERSON1) interesting, they (@MONTH1) might want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject, then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects. There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music, then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music, then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job. I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removing books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else. In conclusion, maintaining access to these so - called offensive materials is beneficial for both individuals' learning and the creative industry.
139	3116	2	3	I think that if there are books, music (@CAPS1), movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if it's offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar. I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by taxpayers' dollars and if we find the offensive to vulgar movies, books, music and magazines, then they should come off the shelf. Kids can read or see or listen to these vulgar things and think it's ok or cool to say or do these things. They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example, pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example, they can see pictures of men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example. We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn. It is important that only appropriate material is allowed to be seen by people. In conclusion, protecting children from offensive materials in libraries is a responsibility that we should take seriously, and removing such materials is a reasonable step.
140	3117	2	3	Going into a (@CAPS1), everyone has their own opinions as to what they should see on the shelves, and what should be put out on the shelves for everyone to see including children of all ages. Some people (@MONTH1) might agree that there should only be things that are age - appropriate for everyone, others disagree. In my opinion when I'm looking at this topic, I think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group, but there should also be a kids' section. If parents are so concerned about what types of books their children might see at a library, then they could just put them in the children's section to view those. There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety of types of books out. When it comes to looking at magazines, movies, and music, I still have the same opinion to a certain aspect. There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelves, because it's not like people can listen to it by looking at the (@CAPS2). But my opinion on the magazines, and movies could vary. There is a certain extent for movies, and magazines. I think they should all be allowed on the shelves, minus any pornography. The reason I think like this is because, kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelves at a library. Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at, and pay attention to them. But when it does come to the pornography, that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library. There is somewhere to draw the line, in any situation and that's where I think it should be drawn at a library. In conclusion, libraries should offer a diverse collection while keeping in mind the appropriateness of materials, especially in a public environment.
141	3118	2	3	All libraries are not good because some people go to the library and use the computer to access websites that children might find. The people need the computer for job applications, and the library owner may want them to get a card. That is unacceptable in some terms. All kinds of kids can learn from the library and do their work if needed. There's so much they can do that they could stay there all week. All people, from little children to adults, can still learn today in the @NUM1 century. You can learn about your ancestry or about car crashes or about anything that's going on in the world. For example, you can learn about Japanese or Chinese cultures. You can do so much from the library or from the books that are there. It's up to the family to get to know more about themselves through the library. In conclusion, libraries offer great learning opportunities, but there are also some issues that need to be addressed.
142	3119	2	3	There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinions of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but it's likely that it's something that the author feels passionate about, and the author could be offended if his opinion was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world, media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media. There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type of culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors' best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world, and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically. This is a very two - sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before, and just removing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited. Libraries are already decreasing severely in their relevance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them, and it's not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other resources, like the internet, again. With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinion and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves. In conclusion, dealing with offensive media requires a balanced approach from both authors and readers, and censoring libraries alone is not a practical solution.
143	3120	2	3	What is offensive to you? See, your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you. There are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive. The world wouldn't be any different if we were to pull all of these offensive materials off the shelves. There wouldn't be anything left because everyone has their own opinion about something and everyone has different inferences about what's offensive to them. I believe that offensive material shouldn't be removed from the shelf. Everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf. There is always something wrong with something. It might be the way someone has said something or the way they meant it by. There is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say. Either they take it the wrong way or they just think it's wrong. Everyone has their own opinion about everything. The same goes for when someone asks you what's offensive to you. Someone else might say that what you find offensive is nowhere near offensive to them. For instance, my grandpa loves all types of music and his life revolves around music. My grandma doesn't like some of his music because she says 'it doesn't sit right with me,' meaning that she doesn't believe in some things that the music is trying to persuade people to do. My grandpa really doesn't pay attention to the lyrics as much as my grandma does because he doesn't see music in that kind of way. My grandpa likes a lot of music because of their rhythm and beat. They always kind of get into disagreements about the music they want to listen to because my grandma finds something in the music that's offensive to her beliefs, but my grandpa doesn't. It doesn't affect him as much as her. If you were to go around and ask people what's offensive to them, there would be so many different answers, and you could never sum it all down to one answer. With only a couple of people feeling offensive to some things, but the majority finding it different, that would ruin it for everyone almost. Then that would almost be everything gone because there's always that one person that takes it the wrong way and has to feel offended. So I still believe that offensive materials shouldn't be pulled off shelves. In conclusion, due to the highly subjective nature of offensiveness, removing offensive materials from shelves is not a feasible solution.
144	3121	2	3	I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still - developing children from reading books that might offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that might hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controversial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) might make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage. To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is appropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did. As a newspaper company, you obviously know about our rights of freedom. We, as citizens, have rights. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my rights that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their rights as citizens. I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf because someone found it 'inappropriate,' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them. However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controversial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public. In conclusion, a book rating system can balance the rights of authors and the protection of readers, especially children, and is a more reasonable approach than simply removing books from shelves.
145	3122	2	3	Why should offensive materials be removed? Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that it doesn't even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement, and a part of it said 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work that I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Personally, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content. Many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, etc. For example, I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a Disney magazine, and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half - naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines. To me, this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want their child learning about sex at a young age? Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also selling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip - hop and rap is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame because they are only creating what people want and what is selling. Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music. They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to the majority of the society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material? In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I don't think removing it would do any good, because people will just find another source to get it. Like Katherine said, there won't be any books left if it's all taken off. In conclusion, while there is a case for removing offensive materials from public libraries, a complete removal may not be practical or effective.
146	3123	2	3	I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are a large number of children who have access to inappropriate materials at the library. However, some of these materials could actually be useful. There was a specific time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home excitedly to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive. It was not only awkward but also embarrassing for both of us. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'. Although there are indeed some materials that should not be in the library, there are also some materials that some people might consider offensive but are actually in the library for educational purposes. Some people think topics like gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There might be some people who would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or due to a problem in their personal lives. Somebody might have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman who might be thinking about receiving an abortion. What is offensive to some might not be offensive to others. I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it could be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals, and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library censorship is crucial to meet the diverse needs of all library users.
147	3124	2	3	Have you ever been offended by a movie, a well - known book, a popular song, or a trendy magazine? Did you have a clear choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of great interest to people is whether these items that are offensive should be taken off the shelves. I firmly don't think they should. I am quite sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, a classic book, or a glossy magazine, and all of them could give a vivid example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again, and if they did, it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, simply don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, clearly don't let them. You can make that firm decision. No one is forcing you to watch or read any of that. I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I consciously choose to read them. No one forced the act on me. Some of you might ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then calmly take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even patiently explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature. There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be almost bare. You have a definite choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive, just don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It might be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. In conclusion, removing offensive items from shelves is not a practical solution as individual views vary widely.
148	3125	2	3	Libraries have tons of books ranging from light - hearted comedy all the way to intense, violent stories. Some people enjoy reading books about war and the harsh realities of violence, while others find it extremely offensive. No matter what the book is about, people have the clear choice to read them or not. So, why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They definitely shouldn't! Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offensive to someone were taken off the shelf, there would be hardly any books left. People usually walk into the library, and most of the time, books are clearly labeled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normally don't go to the section that they don't like. There is absolutely no reason to go to the section that they don't like because they won't be reading a book from there since they don't like it. They would just cause unnecessary problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not, so why bother even worrying about what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what they have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book, that is their personal business, but other parents might want their child to see what all is out there and develop their child's views on various subjects. Everyone has different views and ideas. If every one was the same, the world would be incredibly boring, and there would be nothing interesting to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music, there is always something new to talk about because not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to the vast differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are. So, if the books are not there for children to try and read, they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes might not be that a another child likes or even an adult likes, but that is completely normal as people are not the same. If everyone took the books or music off the shelf that they found offensive, there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most of the time opposites, like comedy and sad books. Most people who would like comedy wouldn't like sad books and vice - versa. Therefore, they would take the other off the shelf, so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best - selling books, people wonder why or how so many sold, but that's just how it is. People out there like the book, so if one person didn't like it, all those people would never have known what that book is about and might have missed a chance to change their life. Books can be very impactful in people's lives, and if they never read that book, the positive change would never have been made to their life. The world goes round because of differences, and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas. Everyone cannot be the same; it just would not work. In conclusion, the diversity of library materials enriches our lives and should be maintained.
149	3126	2	3	Real life is rated @CAPS1, so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that a book is too graphically detailed, a movie too violently intense, or that music too aggressively explicit, then it's their own choice to remove it or not. It is indeed true that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers. Explicit content is all around us, not only in the media and literature. The never - ending game of shielding this generation's teenagers and children is already a lost battle. In this current point in time, the main focus of a lot of movies, popular music, and trendy books is something violent, aggressively explicit, inappropriate, or shockingly explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is completely pointless. There will always be violence and crime in today's world, along with excessive swear words and vulgar language all around. It's understandable that some parents don't want their children reading, watching, or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of. But even if the kids are protected at home, out in the world, sometimes the parents won't be there to monitor. Libraries are public places, and a significant percent of the audience would be upset, frustrated, or angry if the books, music, or movies they liked were no longer available due to the censorship. It might seem as if viewing, reading, or listening to something violent or explicit would have a negative effect on the listener. However, on the streets, at school, at the park, and in many other places, children and teens will be exposed to this type of explicit language. So, attempting to censor it in their reading and viewing material is just a waste of time. In my experience, I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies, and consuming more explicit material, and they have not been negatively affected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when I was nine. So, parents can give their kids somewhat of an age limit, but at one point, trying to censor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual diseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inappropriate material, explicit content, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images. Real life is rated @CAPS1, so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicitness and violence in the world is an endless and futile battle. Certain things might go over the line, but others are just re - enactments and previews of what's really going on in this world. Why would you hide the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating, and music often has an explicit content label, so people should know what's appropriate for themselves. The first swear word a child hears probably wasn't in a song or movie and was probably heard somewhere in the real world. In conclusion, we should accept that real - life exposure is inevitable and focus on educating rather than censoring.
150	3127	2	3	There are many books in the library that clearly shouldn't be there. From books about blatant racism, extreme violence, or explicit pornography, I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library. A library in a school is a great way to help students with important projects, well - written essays, or just for pure reading enjoyment. If my child was in elementary or even middle school, I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornography, in which the library is a better place to find a book than the internet that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school, I think it's really nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it so much easier to work on projects. Also in libraries, there are a large number of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country, they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion, a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be extremely excellent to help them find out some useful tips. Magazines can also have some inappropriate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines, I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, delicious food, and interesting people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers, they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a large number of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library. In conclusion, I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon - based educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it. If something offends you, go have a calm talk with the librarian; they would probably be happy to take it off the shelf. In this way, the library can better serve the different needs of its users.
151	3128	2	3	Books can be good things, but are they always good? They teach us valuable knowledge, entertain us with engaging stories, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things. When a book is inappropriate for the specific reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library. Music is the same way. The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone. Some books may be offensive in religious ways. A person may believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some disrespectful way. Some may say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said every time I walked by it. Books may even be inappropriate for little kids. It may have language in it that the parents don't like. People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the child's parents are like. They could think a word is bad when you think it's fine. Everyone is different. Furthermore, a book may contain images not suitable for children. It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books. Some religions believe that some types of music is the devil's music. I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream - o is the devil's music. She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that God wouldn't like it. Other people's parents may feel the same way. Magazines may also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way. Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them. They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it may not be suitable for everyone. Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely.
152	3129	2	3	Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too? Your cousin believing in one thing, means you have to believe in it also? No, not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate. Objects containing so - called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere; in stores, in schools, inside, outside, they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about, that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it, well I say we don't. Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good - intended? What if something you liked, was of an offence to another, does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion. I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one, it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they may see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong - willed, strong - opinionated person and to me that is all wrong. Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like, that is another person, anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us, so why lessen their equivalence because it's not the same way I feel? We may not all agree with their way of life, we may not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another, so why should an item? A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a CD off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate, but what if your vision of appropriate is another's eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate, especially in the world we live in today. If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile, and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like, and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives, have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all of a sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too. So just because I agree with everything I said, are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not, but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing its pathetic value it has earned, and we may not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fascination with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is, because it is what you live in and it is what you have, because without it nothing would be anything. Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things.
153	3130	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. People live around offensiveness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee using terms that are offensive to African Americans to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the Holocaust cannot view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it. People live around offensiveness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they may hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanities in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profane language and behavior when they go to school and work around other children who might have offensive behaviors. Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work - related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student cannot get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the student's ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rent a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson. Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. First of all, trying to censor a novel might obscure the message or theme. Secondly, people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. Lastly, censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research. If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read.
154	3131	2	3	Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down the aisles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it? Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things. Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, then they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent. Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libraries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child. In the end, parents hold the key to protecting their children from inappropriate content, and taking on the responsibility of proper guidance is essential for a child's healthy development.
155	3132	2	3	Brian Johnson 12 12/12/12 America 15                                    Censorship in Libraries          Should there be censorship in Libraries? If this is a public public library no, but if it is a school library, yes. I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines.          First I'm going to tell you about the books. I think the books in a public public library should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty. Then also sex - ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say. I don't think they should matter if it's a nasty love book or a Stephen King book, all that matters is that they are reading. War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and it's not a great place to be. Now in a school library yes because no parent would want their eight - year - old daughter reading about how to make drugs. I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum.           Next I'll talk about the movies they should have available in the library. I don't think anything over PG - 13 at a public public level. Except like sex - ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, it's got to be PG - 13. In school I think it should be G - PG movies. In those grades they really don't watch educational films, it's all for fun films, so there's no reason for there to be anything worse than G - PG.          Last I'm going to tell you about magazines. In public public libraries I don't think the magazines are a big issue. Just as long as there's not porn and stuff like that. At the school level again I think they should be censored, kids that age shouldn't be reading Playboy. They just need to have learning and for - fun magazines.          Should there be censorship in libraries? No at the public public level and yes at the school level. Public public libraries, the books shouldn't be censored, they should be freely available. In both cases, movies and magazines shouldn't be a problem in public public libraries and should be censored in school libraries. By having a balanced approach to censorship, libraries can better serve the different needs of the public and students.
156	3133	2	3	To begin with, I firmly believe that everyone should deeply admire libraries. I feel this way because there was a time in history when we didn't even have books, let alone well - organized libraries from which we could borrow books. A library is a haven that offers a peaceful and calm environment. People often come to the library not only to collect good books but also to surf the internet, discover new music, and simply relax.   So, to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that if there are items on the shelf that, upon @MONTH1 inspection, come off as offensive to people, they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment where things are constantly offending you. If offensive things are present, it will likely make individuals stop coming to the library. This, in turn, will cause the library to lose a significant amount of business due to the lack of patronage.   The library should be a place that exudes love, peace, and harmony. It should be a place where people feel free and can relieve themselves of any stress. By seeing or hearing something that is highly offensive, it will bring confusion to the library atmosphere. This also makes the librarian's job much more difficult than it should be. They will have to work extra hard to address the difficulties that patrons seem to be having with the library.   Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music have no place in a library. An example of offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, which is filled with all sorts of profanity. This includes music that degrades women in a very disrespectful manner and the kind that makes violence seem cool.   This kind of music will come off as offensive to many men and women. Think about it: who wants to listen to music that makes women feel worthless, or music that is always talking about killing, fighting, and gangs? People would prefer to hear more soothing and relaxing music that can lift their spirits no matter what mood they're in. The library should carefully select the music they offer so that everyone can be well - satisfied.   In conclusion, as stated earlier, the library is a wonderful place to hang out and relax. It should never be a place with offensive items; if such items are present, they should be removed. This would reduce confusion and encourage more people to continue visiting the library because they know it's a truly nice place.
157	3134	2	3	Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor materials in the library. They might believe that some of the material could be offensive or bad for the youth and other patrons of the library. People might think it @MONTH1 would be better to take the bad and offensive items off the shelf. However, I have a different opinion on the subject. I don't think anything should be censored in the library, whether it's books, movies, music, magazines, etc.  The real question is why this material should be censored or removed. The answer is that it shouldn't be. The library is a place where you can go to obtain information on just about anything you desire. If these items are censored or taken off the shelves, the available resources will be limited and may not be helpful to the people searching for information. Another major problem with censoring or removing these materials is that people might miss out on a great deal of knowledge that they've never encountered before, even if it might seem bad or offensive. Such knowledge includes topics like slavery, the @CAPS1 taking over the @CAPS2, and a lot of our world history. I feel strongly that people should know about the world's past.  Now, what happens if the items are removed from the library shelves? What are we going to do with the thousands of books that can no longer be read because they're considered offensive? We can't just get rid of them so easily. A lot of the so - called offensive stuff is true or based on a true story, such as @ORGANIZATION1 park getting arrested because she refused to give up a seat to a white person. So, removing these books would be pointless because wherever we put them, people will still go there to get the material they want to know about.  The most important thing about this issue is who wants these books censored or removed and why they want to do so. Okay, some books are bad and offensive, but you have to look at it this way. People have their own choice regarding what they want to read, watch, or listen to. So, just because some people don't like the material in a library doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way. It's the people's choice, not the opinion of a couple of individuals.  So, at the end, I think that books and other items in a library should not be censored or taken off the shelves. I believe that people have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want. I see it as a matter of people's opinions clashing, and it should be up to the individual's choice, not a few people's opinions.
158	3135	2	3	Okay, to me, people are overly moral in the modern world. I was taught that if you have a problem, you should keep it to yourself. Most people know that censorship is a significant issue, but it doesn't have to be. I know that some things are a bit risqué, but getting this kind of content out there more quickly would be a better solution. You're probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'? Let's talk about children and this content. If you introduce it to them earlier and in a subtle way, children won't feel the need to find out what it is at a later age. If they were to discover it on their own later, the consequences could be severe, such as fines, misdemeanors, loss of respect, damage to reputation, and even some time in jail.   Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general. They are much more impressionable at a younger age than when they are older. Taking such content off our shelves will only create an illusion of a nicer community. I know what you're thinking, why not do that? But if more people in your community seem nice on the surface because of censorship, when a real threat comes, who's going to help? The @CAPS1? Who knows. It takes a while for a squad car to reach a location, and it takes even longer if you're in a city. In that time, someone could have died, been robbed, and the criminal could have escaped.   So, if we let this content stay on the shelves and so on, people will gain the knowledge to understand that using this information to help others can be beneficial. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, if you take this content away from us, people will become weaker and less informed. If you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good. In conclusion, we should embrace the presence of such content in a controlled way to ensure that people are well - equipped to face the real world.
159	3136	2	3	Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you think kids shouldn't be reading or watching? I have, and I've heard of many such books. There's also music out there that is only suitable for adults. There are some parents who are very strict about what their kids watch, hear, read, or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to let my children read, watch, or hear that kind of inappropriate stuff.  When you think about the music, books, or movies that should be kept out of children's reach, what should they be? I think the movies, books, and even music that contain bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from children. Bad language is not appropriate for kids to hear, especially when they are under the age of ten, and it's still not good for them even when they're a bit older. When you hear a bad song playing when there are little kids around, you should quickly turn the station to a different one. If little kids hear this kind of language, they'll likely start saying it at a young age.  Another type of book, song, or music that should be taken off the shelf is the one that has violence. If kids watch, hear, or read about violence, they are very likely to start being violent themselves after being exposed to it. When you're walking around, you shouldn't have to be scared to walk by yourself for fear of getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watching something that you don't think is right for them, you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is extremely bad for little kids to engage with at a young age.  Books, movies, or music about bullying should also be removed. Bullying is never the answer to anything, even though many people might wrongly think it is. If you think it's good for little kids to be learning about bullying, you're completely wrong! It's a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you're caught doing it.  Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think should be removed are the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Children should not be exposed to bad language through reading or hearing. They also should not be watching anything related to violence. Lastly, they should not be reading anything about bullying. In conclusion, protecting children from such harmful content is crucial for their healthy development.
160	3137	2	3	Some books in libraries can offend others. So, the question is, should they be removed? That's the point I'm going to discuss today. Maintaining public self - control is a top priority. So, why do publishers keep releasing and authors keep publishing books that might offend certain groups?  Graphic and gory books usually disgust people. These books should all contain a warning symbol for people with weak stomachs and those who simply can't handle such content. So, in this regard, I'm okay with them. People need to accept that the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and that gruesome things exist. In this situation, if you can't handle it, you should avoid it.  However, offensive material related to races, religions, and other personal aspects is a different concern. This kind of material can certainly inflame groups and may even lead to protests or boycotts. Authors, in some cases, need to carefully review their material and make sure it won't cause any disruption. Young authors should know that inflaming the public is not a good thing. This can not only make the public upset but may also lead to the author getting fired.  False statements or inaccurate statements in books can arouse public curiosity and even lead to conspiracy theories. Not only will it cause a stir in the press, but just like the race/religion issue, it can result in the author being fired. This is definitely not what the author wants. So, making sure the work is based on truth and not hypothetical is an important step. These are great steps towards having a positive influence on the public.  So, in conclusion, authors have a lot of responsibilities. They have to deal with race issues, religion, false statements, and so on. These are some of the things authors should try to avoid. The best outcome an author can hope for is for the public to recommend the book and for it to have a positive impact on the press. By being more careful and responsible, authors can create works that are well - received and beneficial to society.
161	3138	2	3	In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's well - informed decision to read what they prefer. There is no clear - cut and appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should remain undetermined as to what makes a book offensive. In a public library, many children, for whom the books are often censored, are accompanied by their parents. Parents should make an independent and responsible choice on what they can allow their children to read. Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is truly ridiculous. If an author spent time and effort creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not be put on a list of no - nos. If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is refrain from reading it. Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her from reading it. In my experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exposed to them every day on television and the internet. So trying to shield your child from the bad things may seem like a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. The libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books. To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it. If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up.
162	3139	2	3	Honestly there's a lot of books and magazines that need to be taken off the shelf. I can vividly remember in the sixth grade going to the school's library and picking up a book that not only told me what weed was, but it also told me how to grow it! Also, a lot of books refer to drugs and sex these days, and I absolutely hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it has been a while since I've checked one out, had enough references to sex that I could honestly say I thought I was reading a porn magazine. Our schools really need to watch what they put on their shelves. I mean, come on, sixth - graders shouldn't even be aware of what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! Maybe that's why kids get interested in drugs and alcohol at such an early age. The book I read didn't have any negative statements about the weed. What makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs? Like I said before, a lot of books in schools and public libraries have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you, and where you can buy the stuff to make them! Ok, I know I'm in high school, but you shouldn't have books that seem like porn magazines. The book I read had pictures of positions in it! It broke everything down into details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that, my friends, is not alright. It's just sad. It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I don't want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alone them reading about it at all. Just take the books off the schools and public libraries' shelves. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do, it's by accident like my encounters were.
163	3140	2	3	I think that removing books from a library that are considered offensive shouldn't be allowed. First off, people have different tastes in the books they read. I also think that the books that the library carries are educational. They might be offensive to some people, but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us. Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you don't want your child to read those, then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can. So I think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, as everyone likes something different. One reason why I think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different tastes in the books they read. Some people like scary books, some people like romantic ones, so everyone doesn't all like the same thing. Everyone might be offended by something, but people shouldn't let it bother them. My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational. They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history. So I don't think that people should really be too offended by the books that people read. Another reason is that if you don't want your child or anyone looking at the books or other materials that might look offensive to you, then don't let them read them. Everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like, then you're just offending them too. That's why people that enjoy going to the library shouldn't take things so offensively, so we don't have to censor things at the library. So that's why I think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different tastes in the books that they read, the books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books, then don't let them read them. People need to understand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are, they are just trying to state their own opinion.
164	3141	2	3	To be honest, when I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone. Anywhere I go, I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesn't matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equally. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people, it should be removed for good. It doesn't matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters, and in my opinion, everyone deserves the same. I believe that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is a certain way, they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree when I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't consist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Innocent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present. Right now, people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated, and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are. In conclusion, I believe that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are, and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others. Everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care, not hatred.
165	3142	2	3	Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just a few of the different types of books out there, as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us. But, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with their parent/guardian. I believe that even though there are some books, magazines, and music not intended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive. Everyone once in their life had to at least experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply cannot hide from those things but yet face them. We adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive, unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us. If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they can sit and read their favorite books as well, with you by their side where you can watch their every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see. Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn their heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they can read and things they can't. Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and may not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you and expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library.
166	3143	2	3	To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive, I firmly believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This particular book or piece of music might be offensive, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. People have the complete freedom to read, listen to, or watch anything that is appropriate to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to choose what they should do with what might offend others.  Also, from my own experience, I have read a book about African Americans in the stages of our history where they were slaves and were hung for their punishment. It might offend some that their local library has a book on such a terrible topic, but it is found that it is part of history, and others might find it interesting to go back and learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are racist or trying to offend you; they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them, but the libraries cannot make all happy. If you choose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that might offend someone, then it shouldn't be removed. If you would like to read, watch, or listen to anything that might offend someone, then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it.  Therefore, I conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive, they should remain on the shelves. Everyone might have their own opinion or have their own ideals that offend them, but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benefit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide whether or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsible and have to remove anything open to the people that might just be part of our background.
167	3144	2	3	Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isn't usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over - used. Not everyone has the same views and morals; what might be considered appropriate for some people might be viewed differently by other cultures or religions.  In my personal opinion, if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it, etc. Obviously, if the content was published in the first place, it appeals to some audience. No one is forcing people to read or watch things; that is why there is something called viewer's discretion. If everything that was considered offensive to a certain individual or group were censored, there would be no America. In America, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is contradictory to that amendment.  For example, the censorship of using the word 'God' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesn't apply to my beliefs. Although the program 'The Jersey Shore Of New Jersey' portrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs. Even though I find this offensive and stereotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it.  I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for one's children to be subjected to it, that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive, just keep yourself and your children away from it. In conclusion, we should be more discerning about when and what to censor, respecting the freedom of speech while also being mindful of different sensibilities.
168	3145	2	3	Censorship in libraries is not necessary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a unique experience that can help a child learn. If the guardian of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive, then the guardian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials, some kids might refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get into. Censoring books at a library is pointless; you take away options and the experience to learn from certain books.  Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries, you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves is another learning experience taken away.  If there is a book that a child's guardian disapproves of, keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they want, unless a guardian forbids. It is not up to libraries whether a book is offensive or bad. That is solely based on the reader's opinion, and everyone's opinion is different. So again, if a guardian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material, they can forbid their child by themselves.  When libraries begin to censor books, they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids might just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a different kind of book; leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories might seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea because more kids might actually read.  All in all, libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a different story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books help teach a moral or get a point across. Also, some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion, libraries should maintain an open - access policy to reading materials, allowing children to make their own choices under parental guidance.
169	3146	2	3	Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion, no, I don't think that any books should be banned from a public library.  The authors of books have freedom of speech, so yeah, some books might offend people, but if it offends them, they should try to stay away from those books or magazines. I think that if certain books get banned from the library, then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will ban them as well.  In my personal opinion, no, I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library. The reason being is that you can't judge a book by its cover. You don't know if the book is going to offend you until you read it. After you read it or you're in the middle of reading it and it offends you, you should take it back to the library and get a new one.  Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion, no, I don't think that books should be banned from the public library. Because a lot of books that do offend people are the ones that teach us about history. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of expression in literature and let readers make their own decisions about what to read.
170	3147	2	3	IN MY OPINION, I THINK THAT SOME BOOKS PROBABLY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF SOME OF THE BOOKS ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE. SOME OF THE MOVIES AND BOOKS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE CAN BE PRETTY BAD AND SAY NASTY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.  SOME MUSIC CAN BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE TOO BECAUSE IT CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT NOT ALL MUSIC IS BAD. IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO. IF IT SAYS NASTY THINGS, BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TO. However, we also need to be careful not to over - censor. There should be a balance between protecting people from offensive content and allowing for creative expression. In conclusion, while some offensive media might need to be removed, we should approach the issue with caution and a clear understanding of the boundaries of acceptable content.
171	3148	2	3	I believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. We should be able to put anything in books, magazines, music, movies, and so on. This fundamental right allows for the free expression of ideas, no matter how unconventional or controversial they may seem. The other reason why we shouldn't take these materials off the shelf is that we, as individuals, should be able to determine if the book is suitable for our age or our viewings, depending on our own points of view.  My first reason is the First Amendment, which is freedom of speech. The reason why I say that is because we should be able to put whatever we want in our books to express our feelings in any way, shape, or form. Also, if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books, it will go further than that. It will reach a point where the First Amendment will effectively cease to exist.  In conclusion, I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the First Amendment. I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is that it's another way to express yourself or your point of view. Censorship limits our ability to freely explore different perspectives and stifles creativity and intellectual growth.
172	3149	2	3	"You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book contains words that are not appropriate for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not suitable for the young mind to see. Or when you watch a movie or listen to music and the content from them shocks you and makes you wish they would bleep those words. I think it's better to have offensive items such as books, music, movies, magazines, and so on removed from the shelves because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children. Children learn from the world around them, and stuff like this will make the child think that's how they're supposed to act and talk.  Here are two examples of why they should be removed from the shelves: music and magazines. First, when it comes to music, children tend to imitate the actions they see and the words they hear. One good example is rap music. Their songs often have cuss words in them. Believe me when I tell you that I constantly hear kids at my school saying cuss words like the n - and f - word and many more. I also see some boys showing their underwear because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and makes me wonder why their parents are letting their children do this.  Second, with magazines, some of the images they use on their covers and pages are not meant to be seen by children. For example, when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from a magazine, I found a magazine on the table that showed three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits. I thought, ""What in the world is this doing at my school?"" They shouldn't have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school? I'm sure parents would be furious if they found out that their children had access to something like that at school.  In conclusion, this is why offensive items should be removed from the shelves so that children don't see them. Protecting the innocent minds of children from inappropriate content is of utmost importance."
173	3150	2	3	Freedom of the press is a right that not many countries have. America is known as the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of the press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist, and their important messages would remain unknown. Censoring the right to write freely about one's outlook on the world, the government, or anything else means taking away imagination and, in some cases, statistics and events related to the past.  Before today's technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge. The process to make and publish a book was time - consuming, so it was an honor to receive one of the few copies produced. People have a natural craving for information; they like to learn and advance. If all books that are considered 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away, and the enjoyment of reading would be lost.  In the brilliant novel, @CAPS1 @NUM1, a man living in a dystopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediately taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children find it entertaining, and adults do nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered, he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge that the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and destruction, just as in the novel.  Having the right to know about your country's history or what is going on in your current government is critical in schools and colleges. Parents often take offense to the authors that schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are too single - minded and wrong. However, students need books to grow and learn. If every person chose one book to take off the shelf permanently, there would be no more books. Eventually, all information would come from what one knew before the books were banished and would, in time, be gone for good.  Books are a history in themselves. No one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavery or the possibility of a complete government takeover. In order to avoid hearing of this, one could simply choose a more fictional novel to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, but they can exaggerate certain events. Without the actual book or the citation it came from, one could completely alter the public's view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.  Writing is a gift that few have naturally, and to be able to show off one's talent is a privilege. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrelevant. If we strip all forms of music, movies, and magazines of the truth, what does that leave? People always stretch the truth or tell a 'white lie,' but most information is factual. The freedom to write and create books, music, and movies is not just about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong, and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades.
174	3151	2	3	The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries sometimes censor some material because of violence or inappropriate content. However, children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want because it's their life. The writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard to create these forms of entertainment for the public.  The materials considered 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be helpful to others. Reading material can assist a young person in dealing with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it's possible that the book he/she is reading @MONTH1 could help them in the thinking process about what they should do. The books, movies, and music have been created by extremely hard - working individuals, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive?  One of the many times I went to the library, I was looking for a book I had read before, but I could not find it. I couldn't find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This really hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. Some books that are considered 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too self - centered. They only care about themselves.  The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book, then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not remove it from the shelves. Freedom of the @CAPS1 states that anybody has the right to write whatever they want to write. If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves, then we're going to reach a point where there are no books on any shelf. This would be a great loss to society as it would limit our access to diverse ideas and knowledge.
175	3152	2	3	I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelf due to something offensive. Libraries are a very important aspect of life for most people nowadays. Mainly because where I live, our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby. For me and my friends, the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home. The library has the internet and older books with information on the city.  Living in the society we have now, not every household can afford a computer with internet. I myself live in one of those households. The library is a great, quiet place to get your work done. It also provides the internet that people can't afford and need for everyday life. Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper but online.  As a @NUM1 grade student, we have to do a lot of projects that require old books on the city and history. If they remove certain books from the shelf, I @MONTH1 will not be able to find important information that I need. Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them. However, if everyone found something offensive in a book, movie, or magazine, does that mean it should be removed? If that happened, there would be a very limited supply of books.  I have a friend who is of Mexican descent, and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive. But to me, I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history. This proves that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 may not be offensive and might be very important to another.  In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelf due to offensive content. I believe it is wrong. Every person is different and finds different things offensive, but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 might need it. Censoring books based on individual sensitivities restricts access to knowledge and prevents a well - rounded understanding of the world.
176	3153	2	3	Everyone has a fundamental right to read, listen, or watch what they desire. However, sometimes it's not entirely within their control. For instance, rated-@CAPS1 movies are restricted, and most children under @NUM1 are prohibited from watching them. This restriction is either due to a law or a rule set by parents. Music, in my view, is different. Some songs can have a negative influence on children, especially those related to violence or containing cussing. Such songs convey the wrong message to kids. Libraries should not stock those kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view things that others find 'offensive', they should do so on their own time. Not everyone has the same sense of humor, so what some people @MONTH1 find amusing might offend others. Even if libraries have materials that could offend someone, it's ultimately the reader's choice to pick a book. Sometimes, it @MONTH1 be better for children to read these articles independently, as it can save parents the time of explaining later. They might ask numerous questions that parents may not be able to answer. For example, when my brother watched a rated-@CAPS1 movie. In his younger years, he was extremely curious and constantly asked a lot of questions. Sometimes, my mother didn't know how to respond and would change the subject. Well, we all know the common question '@CAPS3 do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer it, but if she did, she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to realize that what he was being told wasn't accurate. Finally, one day, he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happened to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet glad to finally find the answer my mom wouldn't give. In this situation, I'm somewhat neutral. I don't object to removing things that might offend others from library shelves, but on the other hand, it might not be a good idea to have 'offensive' materials in libraries where children can access them. Perhaps it's what makes things less boring and more interesting to readers. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just @MONTH1 be beneficial to have these types of books, whether they state facts or express opinions. Everyone has the right to voice their opinions, and there's nothing wrong with presenting informational facts in articles or movies. The drawback of having 'offensive' things in libraries @MONTH1 not be a wise decision if it's where most children get their books. Parents can always have a say in what their children read or watch. Some parents might not want to deal with all the questions children ask and prefer to give them something that can explain things better. Other parents don't want their children to see or know about anything 'offensive' until they're old enough to understand and be mature about it. So, in some cases, it might be a bad idea to have materials meant only for adults on library shelves where a child might get hold of them. The quotation 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own valid point. The quotation essentially means that if a parent doesn't want their child to read something 'offensive', but the parent reads it, then their children have a right to know. Once a child takes such a book off the shelf and learns about it, they may stop asking questions.
177	3154	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that it is unjust to remove offensive and non - offensive books from library shelves just because one or two students dislike them or don't want to see others reading them. Some things, although offensive, are suitable for reading and learning. It is acceptable for these materials to remain on the shelves if they serve a good purpose, such as for educational learning rather than just for entertainment. It is crucial for readers to be exposed to a wide range of reading materials. They should not only be exposed to clean and normal materials but also be introduced to foreign writing. If we were to remove every item that was slightly offensive or not entirely suitable for readers, would there be many books that could hold people's attention? In conclusion, I strongly advocate that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in certain cases and can keep readers engaged. So, please keep these items on the shelves!
178	3155	2	3	The censorship in libraries should be appropriate for each age group. Children between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 should be capable of reading books with profanity. They should be mature enough to read through a book that contains name - calling and profanity without laughing or taking offense. On the other hand, children who are @NUM3 should not have books with a lot of such profound language in their libraries. They are young and not yet prepared to accept that some people use such words for expressing feelings or name - calling. They should be exposed to very little of this kind of language, and as they grow older, they will gradually get used to it. There should definitely be a point of censorship in the libraries they frequent. For children younger than @NUM4 years of age, they should not read or see things with profanity or bad scenes unless their parents allow it. While we can't control what parents let their children do, we can implement appropriate censorship in schools and public libraries. In conclusion, appropriate age - based censorship in libraries is essential to ensure that children are exposed to suitable reading materials according to their maturity levels.
179	3156	2	3	I am a citizen of the @LOCATION1, and I think that the current censorship on library materials is not ideal but can be improved. There should be an age limit on certain books, magazines, etc. in the library. Some materials are not suitable for younger children due to their lack of maturity. I recall taking my little sister to the public library, and she picked up a book and started asking me about words that she shouldn't be hearing at her age. On the other hand, those books @MONTH1 be necessary. Some people need these types of books and magazines for research papers and similar purposes. As a young adult, I believe that other children my age can read different things and distinguish right from wrong. It also depends on the parents or guardians of the children. If parents feel that they don't want their children to read inappropriate materials, they should accompany them to the library. However, some children don't have mature parents or guardians to guide them on what to read, and that's when the library should take action on book censorship. As I mentioned before, the censorship on books, movies, music, magazines, etc. in the library is okay but could be a bit better. There should be a specific age for children to read or view certain things. We can't simply remove all inappropriate books from the library because some people actually need them. That's why I think it would be helpful if the library set an age limit or marked certain materials as suitable only for mature audiences. In conclusion, a more refined censorship system in libraries, considering both the needs of users and the protection of children, is necessary.
180	3157	2	3	If something is considered offensive, it should definitely be removed from library shelves. When parents send or take their children to a library, they don't expect their children to be able to access inappropriate materials. Some items @MONTH1 offend someone's beliefs and are simply rude. Public libraries are, as the name suggests, public spaces. Everything in them will be seen by a large number of people. No one should have to worry about being offended when entering a place of learning and knowledge. Parents don't want their children to pick up rude materials at the library. Even if a child doesn't check out a book or magazine, there's no way to stop their impressionable minds from flipping through the pages. They might read something that their parents didn't plan to teach them for a while. Many modern books contain crude text and humor. If a younger individual isn't mature enough to understand a topic, he or she @MONTH1 form the wrong impression or ideas about it. If a kid is rummaging through the adult section of the library, they might be exposed to information they're not ready for. Offensive language @MONTH1 be present in the books, and the young person might see it and try to use those words or phrases. If a child reads something about sex, they might be curious or confused and ask their parents about it. The parents, on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age. At that point, there's no going back, and parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds. Parents have the right to restrict minors and children from certain materials, but if the books are freely available, who will censor what each person looks at? Libraries need to seriously consider what's on their shelves, regardless of the form of information. People @MONTH1 think that just because a story is in a book, it can't be real. Some reckless scenarios are shown in movies, and these movies are watched by people of all ages. If an impressionable teenager watches a movie with offensive language or violent scenes, they might act on what they've seen. Since the public library is a public place, the materials it offers should not be offensive. People of all kinds visit libraries. No one should ever leave a library feeling offended, and no parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up. Libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way. In conclusion, libraries must take proactive steps to ensure that the materials on their shelves are appropriate for all visitors, especially children, and do not cause offense.
181	3158	2	3	I feel that they shouldn't be removed because there might be somebody else in @MONTH1 who likes that movie, book, music, or magazine. Just because we might not like it doesn't mean there isn't somebody out there who does. Everything should be in the library since there are different people and not everybody likes the same things. The library is supposed to have everything. So, if we decide to take something off the shelf just because one or a couple more people don't like something or what's being displayed, it wouldn't be right. I've been to the library looking for a movie or a book that I like or want to see, and it wasn't there. I got really mad about that. So, I feel as if it's not right nor fair. Everybody should have their right to whatever it is that they read or like to watch. Even though there are certain books or movies out there that children shouldn't touch, I still feel as if they shouldn't remove anything off the shelves. In conclusion, maintaining a diverse collection in libraries respects the varied interests of all patrons and upholds the spirit of free access to knowledge.
182	3159	2	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I think we should have these certain materials in the libraries. Why I think these materials should stay is because, for @CAPS3, let's say it's a certain movie, song, book, or whatever - just that one thing you've been looking for ages and couldn't find it in any other store. You just happen to go to the library, even though you know it's probably not there, but you're just looking, and you end up finding whatever it is you were looking for. And what if you wanted to look for a mystery book and only the library had that book you were looking for? I can think of a lot of reasons why we need certain materials. Well, I guess that about sums that up for me. And in conclusion, put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? Would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay? You should fight for the materials to stay so that everyone has the chance to discover what they're searching for in the library.
183	3160	2	3	"What is your opinion on reading materials? Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read? Every library has different choices. They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home. I have read many different things in my lifetime so far. I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there. Most books, even if they say one to two choice words, it turns into an adult book. I think it should be up to the reader to decide if they can handle a book or not. Everyone reacts to things differently. Let's take people in my age group, for example. Some of the boys are still immature and think it is funny to act out. Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books. Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature but working their way up the scale. They would be able to handle something in the adult material category. The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle. If we take people's choice away, what are they going to have? You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library and say, ""Hey mommy and daddy, pick me out a book because I'm not eighteen and cannot pick one."" I would not like that. Being one who reads a lot, I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book. Therefore, I would not be able to read as much. I mean, what do you think? Which side would you choose? Everything is a personal opinion. It is all about what you as a reader are comfortable with. Do you want to decide for yourself or have someone with you every step of the way? Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schedule to go to the library. Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read. Why stop someone from getting smarter? A child will only learn more by challenging themselves. Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book that they got to pick out. In conclusion, respecting readers' choices empowers them to grow intellectually and enjoy the freedom of reading."
184	3161	2	3	I believe that libraries shouldn't be censored just because people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this because everyone takes offense to something. If people can't find what they're looking for, then why go to the library? Also, everybody likes different things. I'll support my view in the following paragraphs. Have you ever read or seen something that you or others took offense to? Normally, when someone takes offense to something, they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people were to take away things that offended them in libraries, what would be left on the shelves? Dust? Because there are many things that people find offensive, and everyone is different. This is one reason I support no censorship because there would be nothing left. Also, everyone tends to like many different things. I might like something in @MONTH1 that you could possibly hate. Should it not be allowed in a library because you don't like it? No, because something you like could be taken away by someone else. So, if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like, this would be another situation where nothing would be left. I think that if we combined everyone's things that they hate, it would most likely be everything. These two points bring me to my last reason. If people can't find what they want because it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet, and libraries would become empty like their shelves. Then it was a waste of money to build the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. That's wasted tax dollars we could have used for something better. After reading all my reasons and opinions, I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries. Because everyone is offended by something, everyone likes different things, and no one would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. Some people in @MONTH1 might disagree with me because they're one of those people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what they're for - allow people to read, research, and watch what they want. By avoiding censorship, libraries can fulfill their role as a place of diverse access and knowledge.
185	3162	2	3	Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1. It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music, or movies. Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting. Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, the school system, and especially the readers. In the @ORGANIZATION1, every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic they want. School systems are taking away that right by not allowing certain books in their schools. Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all. The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals. It is not fair to the writer to be discriminated against, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting. The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself. If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights. In general, school systems and teachers are power - hungry leaders of the student body of a school. They make rules just to display their power over students and take away many of their rights. If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of everything being censored. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional. The last major group of people affected by censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students. Censoring a book is taking away that person's ability to learn about and understand a certain topic that was censored. Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the school's beliefs and ideals. In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but especially in school, must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers. Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers. The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occurring in schools around the country every day to safeguard the rights of all involved.
186	3163	2	3	What is this world coming to? We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. As a daughter and a teenager myself, I've personally had the experience of stumbling upon and reading some of these offensive books and magazines. The excessive use of sex, drugs, and violence to create a story has truly destroyed the minds of our youth. I strongly feel this disturbing and destructive material should be promptly removed from the shelves of libraries.  I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read. I whole - heartedly agree that reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling. However, offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and severely distort their way of thinking. The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become. I feel they will eventually let curiosity get the better of them, leading them down a dangerous path.  Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all part of growing up, but I firmly disagree. Trying any one of these harmful activities portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger. It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.  To better prove my point, think of your favorite book. Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her? Well, it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model. They might save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night - life filled with vices in the story as well. This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.  I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries. This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth. It leads them to believe everyone, including their heroes in books and movies, does these things. Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for, and by removing such offensive materials, we can help protect the innocent minds of our youth.
187	3164	2	3	People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook their younger child has on a lot of topics. But really, the kids won't remember half of what they read or see, so does it really matter? Well, according to some people, it does, which I can understand. But I will have to go with the side that it doesn't matter too. Because it's not like they're not going to find out about bad language or sex eventually. So I say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, TV shows, etc.  The fact of the matter is that people or parents get too offended or complain because their little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or because some of the material in the show or magazines is too offensive towards people with disabilities, races, etc. When really, all of this is just humor; none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors' works aren't to be shunned upon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it.  Through all of this, you should know by now that I don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just because little kids' parents are ashamed of what their kid read. Because, like I already said, they're gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books, what kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read? I'm pretty sure I don't want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home all the time. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of literary and media content and let people choose what they want to consume based on their own maturity and interests.
188	3165	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,  My name is @PERSON1. I am a student here at @LOCATION1, and it has come to my attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library. I think this is completely wrong. If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with hardly any books to read.  I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read. I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make my own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading. If I feel I should read books that others might find offensive, then why does that concern you? Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to.  Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting. If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be extremely hard to sit through it. If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do.  If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways. This is a @ORGANIZATION1. Kids cuss all the time and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read. If you're looking to make children more innocent, then taking all of our books out of the library is definitely not the way to go about it. In short, the library should remain a place of free access to diverse literature, and the decision to read offensive books should be left to the individual reader.
189	3166	2	3	Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience. Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it may not be something that they are supposed to be reading. When an author writes a children's book, it is clearly meant for a child to read, not an adult. Also, when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the author is talking about and can act maturely while reading it. Although some novels may not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not the way to fix that, and it is a big mistake.  As humans, we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press. Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about. If they choose to write about subjects that are not appropriate for all age groups, they still have the right to have their books in libraries. Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are. If you take those books away because you're scared that a child might get a hold of one, then you're taking away what certain people enjoy reading.  Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors. They have a children's section made primarily for children, an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read, and a teen section for everyone in between. By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books. Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it may be, and cutting out certain books all together.  If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want. If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things, then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive. Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like. If a person is under that age, then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out.  Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered. Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material, so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries. By maintaining the current system of age - appropriate sections and parental guidance, we can ensure that libraries remain a place of free and diverse access to knowledge.
190	3167	2	3	I think that all offensive materials should be removed from libraries so everyone can read a book, listen to music, and watch movies without being offended. They should have their own separate section for that kind of material.  Movies that are bad should be taken off the regular shelves. They should have a dedicated section just for those movies. The section should be locked up so children can't easily get those movies. This way, only those who are of an appropriate age and have the right to access such content can do so. I think that this would be fair for everyone.  Music that is bad should be taken off the regular shelves as well. They should have a section just for that kind of music. The section should be locked up so children can't get that kind of music. By doing this, we can prevent young and impressionable minds from being exposed to inappropriate lyrics and themes. I think that this would be fair for everyone.  Magazines that are bad should be taken off the regular shelves. These magazines should have a section just for them. They should be locked up. This will ensure that only those who are mature enough to handle the content can access it. I think that this would be fair for everyone.  Books that are bad should be taken off the regular shelves. They should have a section just for these books. These books should be locked up so children can't get them. This measure will protect the innocence of children and allow adults to make their own choices about what to read. I think that this would be fair for everyone.  This is what I think should be done with this offensive materials. If this was done, everyone would have a suitable book to read, a magazine to look at, music to listen to, and a movie to watch. By separating offensive materials and restricting access to them, we can create a more inclusive and safe environment in libraries for all patrons.
191	3168	2	3	Picture this: you come home one day after a long and tiring day at work. Before you even enter the house, you're greeted by the loud, blaring music coming from your child's room. As you step closer, the rhythmic banging bass becomes more distinct, and you start to make out the lyrics. You then realize that it isn't just any ordinary music; it's completely unedited, explicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who in their right mind would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't. Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, TV shows, movies, on the internet, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material. Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off - limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping children's minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general. By implementing reasonable censorship, we can help protect the innocence of our youth and guide them towards a more positive and healthy development.
192	3169	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views. A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightenment. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on a particular religion but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? This goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another. Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inappropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not allowed to roam the library without an adult. This is a very prominent rule because it sets boundaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is key that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults. Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries because they are found offensive because this is censorship and it takes away our rights. We must uphold the freedom of access to information and ensure that libraries fulfill their true purpose of providing a wide range of resources for all.
193	3170	2	3	I don't think we should take books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelf just because we think they are offensive to us. If you think something is offensive, don't get it. I know I would not get something that I think is offensive to me. There are lots of books in the world that I don't like. One of them is horror books. I hate them with all of my heart. The scary stories and gory details just give me the creeps. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is some self - help books because there are lots of stories in them that we don't really need to read. So I think that it is a waste of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is some ancient language books because they are hard to read them in the original ancient language. There are lots of music out there I don't like. One of them is heavy metal. I don't know why I dislike heavy metal but I do. The loud and aggressive sounds just don't appeal to me. The next type is some modern pop - rock. The singers in today's modern pop - rock, I think, are no good. Their voices lack soul and the lyrics are often shallow. The last type of music is some of today's rap. I think some of today's rap uses too many bad words. There are lots of movies out there I don't like. The first one is Inception. I did not get the whole plot of that movie. The complex dream - within - dream concept was just too confusing for me. The next one is Children of the Corn. There was no way I could find out why the children were killing the people over some strange prophecy in that town. The last movie that I did not like was all the Twilight movies. I just did not like them, okay? I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are things people like but I don't like them. There are things that my friend likes but I don't like. There are things I like and they don't like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you don't like. But you can't get rid of the things you dislike in the world. We should respect the diverse tastes and preferences of others and allow everyone to have access to the things they enjoy.
194	3171	2	3	Our founding fathers created amendments for the people. One of the greatest is the freedom of speech. Censorship of offensive materials is unnecessary. Books, music, movies, and magazines may have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them. Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing. People have the right to say how they feel by any medium. Censorship of anything makes a child more immature. Book burning is a horrible action by any person. People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas. In the book Fahrenheit 451, firemen would burn any book seen within a home. Almost every single book in the world is not factual, unless it is non - fiction. The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government. That basically means every kind of book out there. The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games. Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment. Also, the things we read every day are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more. Libraries have no right to censor books. Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation. Why should it change now? Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out. They may have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard. Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs. Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies. I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the Harry Potter series because of the use of sorcery. She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft. I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it. When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious. After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they just saw. The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist. Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body. Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't mean the child should watch porn. Censorship has always been taken the wrong way. People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about. We should not get rid of the obscenity at all. We should have an understanding of the bad things in life. Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind. Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed. Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter. By respecting the freedom of speech and dealing with offensive content through education rather than censorship, we can foster a more informed and mature society.
195	3172	2	3	Should books, magazines, movies, and music be put in higher reaches of children, or should they be left in plain sight? Is it fair to not be capable to see a movie, magazine, or even read a book because others in the area believe it's offensive in their view? If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel it's only for their eyes to see it, then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason for this is because it's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed due to others' opinions. If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and release them to stands for them to be sold. If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track. There are many chances for school projects that may require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get it is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website may be inappropriate. For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over a specific historical event about a particular topic for a grade. The due date comes and he/she doesn't have the information and gets a failing grade for the homework he/she was assigned. The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information. He/she starts explaining themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked. The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' 'It's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.' The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' 'That's good, at least it's better than getting a failing grade on the assignment,' said the student. The submission date comes, and the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands it to the teacher. At the end of class it gets graded and the grade on it turns out to be a passing grade. The student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start. This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves. Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will end up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault. If only a few citizens have opinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them. Even if it's for the safety of the children they may have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of except for that one particular person. We should respect the rights of all to access information and not let the views of a few limit the educational and entertainment opportunities of others.
196	3173	2	3	Bad @CAPS1 in @DATE1's @CAPS2. Libraries are a wonderful place to explore a vast array of knowledge, from the long - standing history of the Earth to the potential future scenarios. However, I firmly believe that certain items should not be present on library shelves. Some books can deeply offend specific groups of people. Even movies and music have the potential to be offensive. The music of @DATE1, in particular, is a significant concern as the lyrics often contain highly offensive content. Movies, while not always a huge problem, can also be offensive at times. There are multiple reasons for movies to be offensive. If they are offensive, why are they in libraries? Well, libraries seem to prioritize making money and thus don't seem to care about offensive products. For example, a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie that is inaccurate and poorly made can be extremely offensive to real - life @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 veterans. These veterans might then demand the movie be removed from the shelves. I've seen both great and bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movies. My grandpa, a veteran, was so upset after seeing a bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie that he cursed at the @CAPS15 and almost threw the remote at it. Then there's the issue with @DATE1's music. I don't think stores, including libraries, should sell albums of @DATE1's rap artists as they mainly talk about drugs, sex, and girls. It's just pointless. The same goes for some country singers who sing about getting drunk and having sex. Most of @DATE1's music is a waste of time. When I listen to it, I find it stupid and senseless. Books can also be offensive, depending on the writer. Books with excessive cursing can be offensive to religious groups that are forbidden to curse or read curse words. Why are such books on library shelves? It all boils down to money. The more books people buy, the more money libraries make. I once read a book about someone killing cats, which I found extremely offensive as I love cats. I was so mad that I threw the book down, took it to the library, and complained. Overall, libraries should be more careful about what they put on the shelves. If they stock inappropriate items, they might face a lawsuit. But if they avoid offensive items, they can steer clear of legal troubles.
197	3174	2	3	I do believe that some places have magazines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelves. Just imagine, if you have children, would you want them to get hold of a magazine with nude men or women in it? People claim they can control their kids in stores, but we often see kids wandering off, trying to do as they please and going to places they shouldn't, like the magazine section. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magazine with nude women in it? That's not appropriate for kids and is completely unnecessary. The same applies to movies. Suppose you rent a movie from a rental place and it has nudity or cursing. Do you want that around your kids? I certainly wouldn't, because kids tend to imitate what they see. I have little cousins, and I've seen them cuss back at their parents many times. When the parents ask where they heard those words, it's usually from TV or movies. So, do you really think it's necessary to have all this inappropriate content accessible to people of all ages? It's not. All such bad stuff should be removed from the shelves and destroyed. I shouldn't have to see it, and neither should anyone else. It's gross, nasty, and inappropriate for children. We should get rid of it all to do everyone a favor.
198	3175	2	3	Libraries offer a wide variety of selections, including books, music, and magazines. However, the question arises: are all these materials suitable for all @CAPS1 visitors? In this essay, I'll explain why I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be removed from the regular shelves and placed in a separate section of public @CAPS2. If a small child enters a public @CAPS1 and picks up a book about abortions, they likely won't understand it as most small children can't read. But what if a fifth - grader picks up the same book? They can read it without difficulty. However, should a fifth - grader be allowed to access a book about abortions at such a young age? I don't think so. Fifth - graders should read age - appropriate books. This is one reason why I believe offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the @CAPS1. When I think of a @CAPS1, I envision a quiet place for reading or studying. Although some libraries allow visitors to listen to music, whether on a computer, iPod, or cell phone, there should be a sound limit. Most people assume libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people often don't follow the rules and aren't aware of how their actions affect others. It's extremely distracting to go to a @CAPS1 to study and have the person next to you blasting a heavy - metal rock song on their iPod. This is another reason for moving offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material to a separate area. I also view a @CAPS1 as a community place where you can feel safe and parents don't need to accompany you. Most libraries have magazines for entertainment, aiming to keep visitors happy. However, not all magazines are rated @CAPS10; some contain highly inappropriate material. Children should read age - appropriate magazines, teenagers should read teen - oriented ones, and adults should read adult magazines. But adult magazines shouldn't feature people with little clothing or sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines. I think inappropriate magazines should be removed altogether, not just given their own section, as anyone can look at the pictures. I sincerely hope you can understand my perspective. It's not against public libraries but about the material inside. If I owned a public @CAPS1, I'd have rooms for different age groups. For example, a room for @NUM1+ and a room for @NUM2+ for books that might be questionable for younger children. I'd also have a music - only room so people can listen to whatever they like. This way, the rest of the @CAPS1 can be a quiet place for studying and reading. I believe all @CAPS1s should be like this to make the world a better place.
199	3176	2	3	Hello, my name is @CAPS1, and I think that the censorship of books, newspapers, and magazines is a complex issue. Some adventure or romance books might have parts that seem in need of censorship, but that's how the author crafted the story to grab the reader's attention right from the start. I believe that sometimes magazines should be censored as they often promote bad habits among people across the @LOCATION1 and around the world. In my opinion, many magazines need to be censored. Some have made efforts to be less inappropriate, which is a good start, but others seem to focus on increasing sales by including controversial content. However, I feel that books should remain on the shelves. Some readers are drawn to the so - called 'censored' parts of a story. I'm not an avid reader myself, but based on what I know about other people, I suggest that we censor some things, but not everything in books. People write books based on their life experiences or imagination. We can't control what they think and write. For some readers, a book's story is fascinating, while others might want it removed from their local library or home. It all depends on the reader. If I had the power, I would censor certain things, but not in books. It was the author's idea to include certain elements, but some things could be left unsaid. Some readers appreciate it, while others don't. It's up to the reader to choose whether to read a book. If it's not appealing, they can simply put it back on the shelf. I firmly believe that some magazines should be censored. Every day, when you enter a grocery store or library, you see swimsuit models and 'sexual appeal' in magazines. It's not right for little kids to see this when they're looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or a book about their favorite animal. Another reason to censor magazines is due to religious views. As more people become @CAPS4 and strive to be in line with @CAPS5, they may take offense to some disturbing images in magazines. As a @CAPS6, I take offense to magazines that promote an idealized and often inappropriate image. In conclusion, while books should generally remain as they are, many magazines need to be censored to protect the sensibilities of different readers, especially children and those with religious beliefs.
200	3177	2	3	The way I see it, movies or books shouldn't be removed from the shelves. It should be our own right to choose whether to take a movie or not. Also, music, such as country or sad music, is different from movies and books. You can't simply take music off the radio. No matter what you do, like shutting it off, turning it down, or changing the channel, in today's world, there will always be content on the radio that you don't want to hear and some that you do. That's my opinion on movies and music. Also, if there was a way to keep offensive movies away, I probably would support it. There are good movies and bad ones. One particularly offensive movie is (Shylo), which shows an old man hitting a dog. This can be extremely offensive to someone who has experienced beatings in their upbringing. In conclusion, while we should have the freedom to access movies and music, offensive content should be carefully considered, and steps should be taken to limit its exposure, especially when it can cause distress to certain individuals.
201	3178	2	3	We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. This freedom allows us to explore different ideas and cultures. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you? It would surely be a great loss. Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material. We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to. I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me. We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects individual freedom while protecting the well - being of younger audiences is the best way to handle censored materials in libraries.
202	3179	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no I do not. It is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completely remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it, they should be able to express their unique perspectives. I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express their thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. Sometimes stories cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Whether those words be good or bad, I feel like without them the book that is being read is not all of what it could have been. In my opinion, censorship takes away from certain values or qualities the book could have had with the original context still in it. And to me that is not fair. It's not fair to the author who poured their heart into the work. And it is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book and wants to experience the full story. I know from my personal experiences with reading books that 'yes' I have read books that have had bad language in them. But just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completely taken off the shelf. For example, the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than I have any other book that I have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being censored or taken off the shelf for that matter. All I am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. Because that is getting away from what the overall message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No I do not. Neither should you. In conclusion, we should respect the creative freedom of authors and give readers the opportunity to engage with un - censored works.
203	3180	2	3	Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. These issues are often reflected in certain books, movies, music, and magazines. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict. We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer in the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter what precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too young to see them, like under the age of @NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though. @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occasional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. @ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world - wide phenomenon. Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song. He is being introduced to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated. I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconsciously) to participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with what it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up too fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed to create a safer and more appropriate environment for all library users.
204	3181	2	3	The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropriate, another person may find obscene and vulgar. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, may insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person. A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f - bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just - in - case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house. To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public. No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut - off as to how inappropriate or vulgar something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, separate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect. Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves would be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove. A religious family that believes @PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelves of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose. The graphic novels I find inappropriate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropriate, instead of the world. Although not everything is appropriate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to censor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be removed from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessible manner. This way, both the freedom of access and the protection of different sensibilities can be balanced.
205	3182	2	3	There are many different people in this world, who have many different opinions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Just because one person does not particularly like horror movies, that does not mean that movie stores should remove horror films from their shelves. As creepy as it may sound, there are many people in the world who are slasher film freaks. They live and breathe scary movies. I myself like just about everything out there. I will read any book or listen to any type of music, it actually widens my taste in certain materials. I feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were @CAPS2 The @CAPS3. and you would like to share your childhood stories with your children. BUT unfortunately, bookstores took @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsense. Many people like many different things. There is no reason to only sell what you like. Otherwise your business will fail. In a marketplace of ideas and entertainment, diversity is key. By offering a wide range of products, businesses can attract a larger customer base and thrive. So, it is essential to keep all kinds of media on the shelves to meet the varied interests of consumers.
206	3183	2	3	What is considered offensive? If we took books, music, movies, and magazines that people found offensive off the shelves, there would be nothing left. Everyone is different, which means they all get offended in different ways. By taking all this off the shelves, we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world. Things we learn about in school, such as slavery, wars, and some politics, can offend many people. But if we were to take the related materials off the shelves at school and libraries, children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alcohol? Many parents do not talk to their children about the uses of controlled substances. So, without these sources, they may never know the harm that these substances can do to someone's body. Everyone takes something offensive, but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So, who is to say what offends people and what does not? If that's the case, shouldn't we take all books, movies, music, and magazines away from children's schools and libraries? Adults get offended too, so would we take all of their resources away, also including the newspaper? By taking away what one might call offensive, we would land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, nothing at all because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive. Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone might get offended by talking about one's race, another might get offended by talking about certain topics, and someone might even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat. Everyone looks at everything differently. So, why try and control us all as one? All people think differently and they know what they want to read, hear, and watch all by themselves. They don't need someone to tell them. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of people's sensitivities and not over - censor in an attempt to please everyone.
207	3184	2	3	Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, such as schools and TV shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intended for young children should not be censored. If you were to censor everything because some people find it offensive, then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community. Censoring books, movies, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a waste of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explained the principles of a particular field because a person found it offensive, then we would never make advancements in technology. Censoring items like books is just plainly idiotic and ignorant. Studying material is our only way to advance in science, and if we can't get the right books to study because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive, then we will never make breakthroughs in technology. Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really aren't good parents. If they really were concerned with those topics, then they shouldn't buy their children the movies or the books that they find offensive. It seems that some parents want to claim they want to censor those items because they find it offensive. But not all parents feel the same way. Some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their children are mature enough to handle things like these. As a child, I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up without censorship. I watched movies and read books that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all meant. I see why parents want to censor their kids from topics like those, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topics and see if they are mature enough to handle it. Censorship is great for children's TV shows. But when you start to censor someone's ideas because you find them offensive and wrong, then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and deserve the right to not have their work censored because a small group finds it offensive. Censorship is a great tool, if used right. In conclusion, censorship should be carefully applied, mainly for protecting young children, while respecting the freedom of access to knowledge for others.
208	3185	2	3	Book Censorship? Should books be censored? This is a national problem about the contents of books. It is a big deal. What one parent feels is very offensive, another might feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn. If you ask me that question, I would say, 'Yes, I believe the books should, but to a national scale and not a community one.' By this, I mean a book with things like references to nudity or other things of vulgar nature, not just because it has a bad word in it that a parent feels to be inappropriate for their child. I believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry. Also, I believe that it is the parents' job to regulate what their children read. If they believe the book is vulgar or inappropriate but the system doesn't, then they need to prevent their children from reading it without taking it off the shelf. It is the parents' job to regulate the reading of their children, not the contents of the bookshelf. Like in Katherine Paterson's statement, 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' By this, I believe she means that if we all took a book off the shelves for our children, there would be no books because what is not offensive to you might be very offensive to another parent. So, the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids. Yes, I believe in a government censorship program but to an extent. It is the parents' job to regulate the readings of their children, but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf. In conclusion, a balanced approach with national - level guidance and parental responsibility is the key to handling book censorship.
209	3186	2	3	No, I would not think it would be the right thing to do. To just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them. It's not only one person's decision. People, or some people, would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf because it's offensive to them. Just because one person finds that book or books offensive doesn't mean that they should have the right to just throw the book away. There could be many people out there that really like that book or those books, and they wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore. All because one person or a few other people don't like the book. Yes, there are books out there that a lot of people don't like, but that still doesn't give one person the right to throw the book out, all because they don't like that book or that series of a book. No one should have the right to just take a book that they don't like out of a library and throw it out because they don't like it. There could be a smart little boy or girl that likes that book, and because that one person threw it away because they don't like it, now that little boy or girl won't get to read their favorite book. That's why I don't think books that someone thinks is offensive should be taken out of a library. Because there's always someone out there that likes that one book that you might want to throw away. If you think the book is that offensive to you, just stay away from that area of the library and don't think about that book. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse reading preferences of different people and not let the views of a few dictate the availability of books in a library.
210	3187	2	3	The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie, etc., everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many people's point of views, it shouldn't be available to the public. I personally believe that if something is seen as vulgar and offensive, it shouldn't be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this, and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well, and something so negative could change the mindset of the child. We all want to bring our kids up right, and letting them have availability to negative material is uncalled for. It's not only kids either that are affected; adults also are affected by the media. Adults can get fooled too, believe me. I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I believe that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things. Some students might not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student. I believe that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough, I stand for whoever it is that did it. Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child. There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of their abilities. In conclusion, it is crucial to filter out offensive media content, especially when it comes to protecting the innocent minds of children and ensuring a positive influence on all viewers.
211	3188	2	3	I think that they should remove certain inappropriate books, and take away more potentially harmful stuff from the kids nowadays, because they are getting worse and worse almost like every single day. I think they should move the age limit from @NUM1 to @NUM2, so at least they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want. But they should go through and do a self - check on everything that they put out in the stores. They should also have clearly demarcated different parts in a library so that the little ones don't accidentally get to the adult section, such as adult books that have explicit content about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that category. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff than my parents, and it's because nowadays kids pick up on stuff a lot more easily. So I say we, as in the @LOCATION1 citizens, need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of. When I was growing - up, I didn't know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because every single day they are coming out with something new that can affect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in today's life, like in elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in their heads at a really young age, they will remember it. I'm not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but at least the percentage of the population involved in such things will go down, and parents will be a lot happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to their kids about sex, making up stories so that their kids won't know. They need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? They should be more aware of the real life as it is out there. So all the parents out there should not lie to their kids about the sex life. So that's what my personal input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.
212	3189	2	3	Books have been an integral part of every single person's life as soon as they learn to read. First, our parents lovingly read us books to gently lull us to sleep. Then, our teachers read us books to effectively teach us things or to keep us quietly preoccupied. Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read books for classes. There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be receipts, orders, or recipes. Reading is something that we simply cannot get away from. This leads me to say that authors write books for an audience and write the book as best they can to attract the attention of the audience. I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on. I think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book. There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive. Also, there are advantages to reading books that @MONTH1 show something different that that person @MONTH1 have experienced before. First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive. Everyone has an opinion, and just because one person does not like the book, it should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else. If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book. Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not either. That is just part of humans having their own opinions. On a different note, I think that children's books are a little bit different. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children. I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children. For young children, I think that parents should just carefully read the book first and judge whether or not they think their child should read it. Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up some detailed things about the book. The internet is a great source for in - depth reviews and ratings of books. Therefore, I believe that censorship for children's books is a responsibility of the parent. Lastly, I think books are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently. When I read a book, think about the scheme, vividly imagine the characters, and react to the events, I come up with my own opinion of the book. My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinion of the book. But we both gained something by reading the book. In conclusion, I think that books should be censored by parents and that is it. I think that reading books is a very positive thing. So no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read. Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about. It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf.
213	3190	2	3	I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive. Many people have their own unique taste in what they like to read, write, and do. Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelves so people can do what they enjoy best. Books and magazines @MONTH1 be offensive, but they @MONTH1 also strongly entice the reader. I personally love books about drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things. In fact, my favorite book is banned from my school library. If they took all inappropriate books out of the library, what would I read? Not everything can be just peachy - keen all the time. It's not like that in real life, so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isn't true? I know I wouldn't want to read that. Just like books and magazines, everyone has their own taste in music. Some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock. If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf, that would make people angry. That's like not playing a song on the radio that's offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degrading to women. If it can be played on the radio, why can't it be in a library? They're going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway. Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects. Many people are interested in these movies. If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre, why can't you check it out of a library? Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent. What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf? Fail? I know I would become angry if that would happen to me. Keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelves. People will eventually see them, hear them, and watch them even if it's not in the library. Even if you take out offensive materials, they're still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do.
214	3191	2	3	When have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so blatantly offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf? Have you ever read a book half - way through and seriously questioned why you are reading it? Why would you read a book that you know you're not going to like? If someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the exact same right as them. I thought everyone was treated by equal rights. When I ever do read, I always carefully read the back of the book or what's called the summary of the story so I can see if I'm going to like it or not. If I know a book is going to offend me, or a magazine, or even a movie, most likely I'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them. Obviously, the author doesn't like censorship or she wouldn't be arguing about it. It's obviously something that bothers her, and everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs. I respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard predicaments. I can say I'm not really a regular reader who always goes to libraries and reads books. But I can tell you if I ever did go to a library and I found a book on the shelf that offends me, it's probably going to offend someone else. So why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I think if it's going to offend someone in particular, it's probably going to bother someone else. I'm not saying everyone is alike, but most people believe in things that other people believe in. People can have the same agreements and disagreements. I do have to agree with @PERSON1 because she is right. You would be amazed at the amount and different things people can get offended by. I have tons of experiences of movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me. But I didn't let it pull me down or anything. For example, I quickly stopped watching the movie, and I stopped reading the book that bothered me. You can't wear your emotions on your shoulders, but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe. @CAPS1't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions. If certain things offend you, @CAPS1't let them bother you. Just stop doing what you're doing and move on to something else. Like I said, I have had a lot of experiences of offensive things I have read and watched. Like awhile back, I watched a movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do. It was just because of the time era and it was also because he was black. That's the kind of stuff that really upsets me. Because we are all the same. We @MONTH1 look different and see things different. But our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air. I have always gone by the saying, '@CAPS1't ever judge a book by its cover until you read it.' So whatever people @MONTH1 think, I believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in. @CAPS1't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel. I agree with Katherine Paterson.
215	3192	2	3	When I go to a library, I @MONTH1 often find some stuff that is offensive to me. But if something is offensive to me, the person beside me @MONTH1 not necessarily think the same thing is offensive to him or her. When people try to put strict boundaries on what is offensive and what is not, they simply cannot. There is a wide variety of people that all have different opinions based on their unique histories. What I think is offensive @MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded in other people's eyes. The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set, clear - cut definition. I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. There needs to be reasonable limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups. For example, you would not want a kindergartener to be able to easily check out a @CAPS1 movie. Some censoring has to be done to protect people. But it all comes down to common sense. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive, but if we use our common sense, the problem @MONTH1 be gradually solved.
216	3193	2	3	Certain people believe that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off of the shelves of libraries. I firmly think that offensive books, music, and media should not be removed from the shelves. It is a person's own right to view certain offensive things if they choose to do so. It is also not another person's right to decide what other people can and cannot observe. If certain offensive items like music and books were removed from library shelves, people's knowledge would be restricted to only what the library or the government wants them to know, and that is clearly not right. It is someone's personal decision whether or not they look at, listen to, or read offensive things. People shouldn't be sheltered by society and only know what is intended for them to know. If libraries eliminated offensive media, people would be unable to form their own opinions and ideas. In some cases, reading and being aware of certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world. One such case is how people should know about the Holocaust in the @DATE1. I'm sure reading about the Holocaust is very offensive to numerous people, but even though this history is disturbing and offensive, people should know about it so that history does not repeat itself. The government and society do not have the right to decide what people take in. For example, what if all of a certain type of music was eliminated from libraries, the internet, and TV; it would gradually fade out of existence. Certain things like reading about the times before racial equality and such things as slavery are very offensive for people to read about. But these things must be read, heard, and passed down through history so it isn't forgotten. The knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries. Yes, offensive things shouldn't be celebrated or regarded as good, but people should know. People in the world can't just know the good things or only what their society wants them to know; they also have to know about the bad things and offensive things that happen and have happened as well. In conclusion, keeping offensive materials in libraries is essential for a well - informed and free - thinking society.
217	3194	2	3	Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote, I think she was trying to convey that if someone picks up a book or a magazine, reads it, and then puts it back, and perhaps they @MONTH1 find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they @MONTH1 not find it offensive, then you have two different viewpoints on a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but to another it @MONTH1 not be. Different viewpoints really affect how to censor books. Because people are so different, their differences in how they feel about a book could influence what should happen to that book. I don't believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a large number of different people, then yes, they should be removed. But if it's only bothering one or two people while there are other people who agree that it's not offensive, then don't get rid of it just because of a couple of people. Take a vote, maybe, to see how many people agree and disagree on keeping or getting rid of it, and then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it based on that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remembers an experience from it, and then someone else reads it and feels offended by something, it's not fair to the other person to get rid of it. It's especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences. So, don't remove books just because a few people might find it offensive. Take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people decide on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what different views you @MONTH1 find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their views on the book and then debate on whether or not to keep it. In conclusion, a democratic approach through voting is the most just way to handle the issue of offensive materials in libraries.
218	3195	2	3	Library Censorship. Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain. As Americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as American citizens. Personally, I hate rap. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percentage of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed? One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series, by @PERSON1. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growing up by depending on @CAPS1, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a @CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life - changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive? Although some wish they could eliminate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are supposed to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive. In conclusion, libraries should uphold the principles of freedom of access and expression while also respecting individual sensitivities through proper categorization.
219	3196	2	3	Censorship in books is one of the main concerns in @LOCATION1. If it was up to me to remove a book from a shelf, I would not do it. In my personal opinion, I think that we as @CAPS1's should just read over the problems and quit complaining about it. Yes, we do have some books that people seem to not like, such as 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1'. But the only reason that it has been pulled off the shelves of libraries and schools is because it uses the word 'nigger', and I find it to be rather idiotic that people would overreact to that word when they themselves were not even around to know the real meaning of it. Censorship in music is another big concern for people in @LOCATION1. The lyrics used in most songs I find to be 'disturbing' or are trying to get people and young kids to commit acts of crime and other illegal acts. Music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are what's making kids do stupid stuff. The music talks about sex, drug usage, and murder. I don't think that I would go as far as to pull it off the shelf, but I would make the sellers put them in a 'can only purchase if @NUM1' section. Most of the crime we have today people blame on music. To my observation about these subjects, I have seen people read a book that uses profound language in it and be okay with it. They don't overreact to it, so therefore it shouldn't be removed from shelves. Regarding the rap music, sure, in a way it should be pulled off the shelves and never be sold again. But I have seen people who listen to it and never smoke, never kill, and never harm another person. From my own experience, I listen to some of these gore - obsessed bands and read books with profound language and got over it. These things should be overlooked and forgotten. This is just a common - sense thing, but there are a lot of things that should be pulled off shelves, and it has to do with movies and magazines. Some movies have always been a problem to society. I have witnessed that some movies show just a little bit too much nudity in it, which I think is not a good thing that our younger children should see, whether it's at the theater or on TV. These things should be pulled. My observation about magazines is that I have personally heard one of my best friends say that 'I want to look as skinny as this girl does on this magazine because I'm too fat'. There are a lot of magazines that should not be shown or read because it does say that skinny is better, and so many girls and women are starving themselves to look like the person on the cover of a magazine, and it's ridiculous to see that happen. If it was my choice, I would ban these materials from usage or sight, mainly because this is all just one big peer - pressure conspiracy. I would not ban all of the things that I have mentioned in this paper, just the things that I personally find disturbing or not fit for the public's eyes. In conclusion, while some forms of media need proper restrictions, a blanket ban on offensive materials is not the answer.
220	3197	2	3	I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries. In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing. Also, it depends on the ages of the kids or adults. People are different in many ways. It also depends on the way they take it in their satisfaction. If they move books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves because they're offensive, that wouldn't be a very good idea. How would other people get a hold of it and want to read it in life if they get taken off the shelves? Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else. I just don't think that people would be very happy. Also, there are different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that. People would like to learn about different things. If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read. Children's and up - to - adult books have all different kinds of things. The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things; sometimes they can have more information in those books than others. In conclusion, censorship in public libraries restricts access to diverse knowledge and experiences. We should strive to keep a wide range of materials available, while perhaps providing proper guidance based on age and content, to ensure that everyone can benefit from the library's resources.
221	3198	2	3	If the library is in a high - school, then we are all old enough that we have already seen or heard anything and everything offensive. After all, high - school students are on the cusp of adulthood, exposed to a wide range of real - world scenarios. In case we haven't though, you can't shield your kids from offensive material. This over - protection hurts them in the long run. Such as when your boss gets to work and you or someone around you mess up an important assignment or task, he might use terms such as the 'damn' word or other vulgar terms to describe how mad he is. If you were to just hear those for the first time being yelled at you, there is a chance you would have a breakdown or be ineffective for work. Now, I'm not saying we should all 'cuss' every day and talk in vulgar tongue. I'm just saying that the real world doesn't have a 'clean' version. There is no mom or dad there to stand by and say, 'oh no, that's not acceptable speech, son'. If you took a survey of the daily language of teens and young adults, almost 80% would say they use some form of vulgar language or inappropriate terms. We need to have our kids and teens know it's not okay to say those things and they need to know what is acceptable in society and not. But taking from them in the library and then thrusting them in a world with daily inappropriate acts is not right. We should prepare them gradually, so they can handle the real world with resilience.
222	3199	2	3	Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something against it, then we would hardly have any books at our libraries. Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that affect our opinions. Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. For instance, religious beliefs can strongly influence what one considers appropriate in a book. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I don't like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldn't bother me but that would be extremely selfish. Even if something is totally inappropriate and offensive, it is still information. Maybe it shouldn't go in the little kids section of a library or store, but I don't think it should be removed completely. Music especially. There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I despise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people I know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but that's just how things are. So no, I don't think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We can't hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove the materials we don't care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then we're left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech, we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy, as long as it doesn't cause real harm.
223	3200	2	3	I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries. Books are written to stimulate the imagination of a person's mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest bit offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever written until that person has grown up. And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics. For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature. So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets there, he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive. What would that person do? Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country? I say no! This is a problem because almost every great book ever written has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader. From personal experience, I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career. For example, when I was in the 8th grade, I was assigned a book report over Mark Twain's 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. So I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found. I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro imprinted on its pages. So I asked her if I could go to the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well. I did not know what to do; I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over. So eventually, the teacher had to change the report topic because not one student was able to find 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves, then we would not have had this problem. Another example was when my friend Ahmed wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from. But when he got to the library, he could not find any books over the Arabic world. So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria?' And the librarian said that they were all removed because after 9/11, some people saw Arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked. I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found Arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race. These are only a few things that have already happened because of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by. Sure, people have a freedom of speech but it should not affect what books belong on the shelf. Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to affect libraries of the public. We should preserve the diversity of knowledge in libraries for the sake of education and personal growth.
224	3201	2	3	Censorship in Libraries. There are a lot of things on the library shelves that you might be concerned about. You might be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves, it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things to consider are what pictures it contains, the language it contains, and what kind of advertising. Some things I have experienced is with the language it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies that have curse words. Also, some might have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that there is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff. For example, a movie might show a character using drugs in a cool - looking way, which could give a wrong message. Also, another thing is advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as saying it's good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in their hand, and we think it's cool to try it, but it's not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or scents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin your whole career in high school and maybe in college. The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, there could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines, there can be pictures in which you don't approve either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have inappropriate scenes, and inappropriate pictures. Some things are like what pictures it contains, the language it contains, and what kind of advertising there is. On the library shelves, it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You might be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. There are a lot of things on the library shelves that you might be concerned about. However, completely removing these items might not be the best solution. We should find a balance, like having age - appropriate sections, so that people can make informed choices.
225	3202	2	3	Books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. Books tell stories, fiction or non - fiction. Many books that might be found offensive are historical. These books could include topics such as wars, eras, people, etc. Everyone has the same rights to read any book they want. They also have the right to not read the book at all. Books that are taken off the shelves of a library because of one person, or a group of people, being offended hinders the ability of someone who wants to read the book, to read the book. We, as people, should not be able to take this right away from other people. They should be able to read anything they want. If someone wants to read a biography or history about Hitler, they should be able to. The topic of Hitler and the Nazi Party might be found to be offensive because of what they stand for. If we look at the topic as purely a historical reference, not as a story to be read for enjoyment, there will never be any offense in these books. These stories have a large role in history. If we do not learn from their mistakes, history might repeat itself. History is around to be studied, even if the topics might be offensive to some people. Political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story. Such as in To Kill a Mockingbird. This book has many issues when it comes to political correctness. These issues include; the killing of an innocent man and revealing the flaws in our judicial system, the use of the word 'nigger' to describe the black characters, and the racial inequality of the South during the 1930's. These issues would definitely be offensive to some readers, but this book is an award - winner and uses history as a guide. The situations in this novel are ones that could be real. They are things we must learn about, so we do not repeat them. Another story that fits quite well into this topic is Fahrenheit 451. This novel is about a world where all books are burnt. No books are allowed to be read by the people. This book reveals the removal of offensive books to its extreme. No matter who you are or what you believe, there will be some topics that you find offensive. If we remove every book that someone finds offensive, we will have no books on the shelves of any library. A library is not a library without its books. If we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves, we will not be able to stop it. One day we will end up like the world in Fahrenheit 451. No history will be known but what is passed down. No more stories will be here to entertain us, but the ones memorized. No books will exist and this world would be terrible without books. Books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. The taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want. It reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish. Political correctness should not take the place of our own freedom, and as long as we keep our books on their shelves, it won't. We should embrace the diversity of knowledge in books to build a more informed and understanding society.
226	3203	2	3	I believe that libraries should have more censorship. Some books, magazines, and movies that contain inappropriate content should be removed or grouped by age. From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they can negatively influence young minds towards violence, sexual activity, and drug use. Young children are at a stage where they should not be exposed to such things. First, I think books that contain explicit violence should be removed. I believe that children are the most vulnerable to influence. I also believe that violence is one of the most harmful things to be influenced by. Graphic violence in books can even influence the idea of killing. Constant exposure to fighting and killing in books is not good for young children. No young child should be able to check out books full of shooting and intense fighting scenes. If they can check out such books, it may make the kids think that such violent behavior is acceptable. Being influenced by violence can lead children down a path where they may commit crimes, and surely, reading a book is not worth the risk of going to jail. Next, I believe that all sexual - activity - related material should be removed from libraries. Sexual activity is a topic that should not be exposed to children until it is the appropriate time for them to start learning about it. For example, a young girl reading a book where teen pregnancy is portrayed as not being a problem can mislead her. The reader may think that this is the norm, which is clearly wrong. Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should be restricted from young children's view. Such content can influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about at their age. At the very least, these materials can be sorted into an adult - only section. Finally, drug use should not be presented in a positive light in books for kids. Children should not read or watch anything that promotes drugs. Unless it is about saying no to drugs and the negative consequences of using them, children should not read such materials at all. Drugs can make people act against their better judgment. Children should firmly say no to drugs and to books that promote the opposite. In conclusion, that is why I believe that we need censorship in our libraries. We need it to protect young minds from the negative influences of violence, drug use, sexual activity, and many other inappropriate themes. By implementing proper censorship, we can create a safer and more suitable environment for children in libraries.
227	3204	2	3	Dear newspaper and staff, it has come to my attention that there is a proposal to have a removal and or censorship of some books in most libraries in the community. I find this unacceptable; in my opinion, this is an attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offensive reading material from future generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labeled 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1'. This book vividly describes a child's hardships and the abuse he endures on a daily basis. Books of this sort are not only informative but also give the reader an open mind on how things might have been in the past. Some topics that these books may include are slavery, abuse, war, and discrimination. These topics are still relevant in today's society. Censoring and removing these books are pointless because at least three of the four are current issues. It is extremely important for our generations to be aware of the hardships, problems, and lessons that these topics have raised. Without informing our generations of these issues, it could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent. My opinion on movies, however, is a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purposeful acts of discrimination and or offensive material. Most movies nowadays, if they are offensive in a way related to the movie, are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2. This allows certain age - groups to watch material that might be offensive or perhaps discriminatory, but they also need adult accompaniment to preview the movie. So in my closing, I would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/discriminating issues. I fully believe that open - content should be allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Parents/guardians must make plenty of observations if needed. I appreciate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks! Sincerely, @PERSON1 - @ORGANIZATION1.
228	3205	2	3	Everyone today gets offended daily. So, going to a library and seeing offensive material on the shelves is no different from the rest of the day. However, there are young and innocent minds that have not been polluted and influenced by these offensive materials, and they should have the right to keep their minds pure. One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults should be put in one area of the library, while the lower - rated, more suitable material is put on display for the general public. The higher - rated material can be placed in an area that is not easily visible to the public on a daily basis, keeping it somewhat secret. This way, it protects the uninfluenced minds, and the people who want to access such material can still do so. Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. In my opinion and experience, such material corrupts both the mind and soul and causes people to be things they are not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things meant for inside of marriage, often accomplish nothing of great value in their lifetime. They become a hindrance to society. But if they cannot access the material, they will need something else to do to fill that time. In which case, they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf. This thus leaves the libraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way it is, they can put the offensive material in a secluded room, or they can remove definite offensive material and help society keep moving forward, accomplishing great feats for the next generation to observe. By doing so, the amount of offending someone can go down, and maybe the library attendance can go up as the library becomes a more family - friendly place.
229	3206	2	3	Have you ever found or seen books, music, movies, or magazines in a library that are offensive to you? If so, then would you have wanted to remove it off of the shelf so none of your children or anyone else that might have found it offensive could see it? Well, I have actually gone to the library and seen some things that were offensive to me, and I have also heard my family members talking about similar experiences. So I am going to talk about what I have heard from my family about seeing or finding books, music, movies, and magazines offensive. Also, I am going to explain how I felt and what I wanted to do when I saw those offensive things in a library. The last thing that I am going to talk about is how I feel about censorship in libraries. First, I have been hearing from my sisters, my mother, and my step - mother about how they find some books, music, movies, and magazines at a library that were offensive to them. Now I do not know exactly what the books, magazines, etc., were that they found offensive, but I do know what they thought about them and what they wanted to do. One day, my sisters, mother, and step - mother were talking about a couple of books that they found offensive. They never said what the books were, but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them. They told my family and I that they were badly offended by what the books were called and what they were about. Also, they were saying that they would have really liked to have taken the books, music, movies, etc., off of the shelves so other people that might have found them offensive would not see them. But, they all also agreed on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves. Their reason is that there are a lot of people whose opinions they do not know. There may be people who do not find these materials offensive and might actually want to read them. So, they just agreed to look past them and ignore what is there if it offends them for the sake of those who do not find them offensive. Now, from my point of view, I have also had a couple of times where I walked into a library and found a couple of books that were offensive to me. I really did not like what the books were all about and what they were called, and I really would have liked to take them off the shelves and throw them away so no other person who might have found them offensive would find them or see them. But then I thought about the fact that there might be other people who would actually want to read those books. So I decided not to remove the books from the shelves, respecting the fact that there are other people out there who would want to read them. At the same time, I knew that there are people who could find them offensive, but I just thought that they would just ignore the fact that they are there. So, regarding the last point, do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves at a library if they are found offensive? Also, what are my views on censorship in libraries? Well, I do believe that removing offensive materials would prevent them from offending anyone who walks into that library. But, if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive to them, then there would literally be no books left in the libraries. Then there would not be any point in having libraries or in anyone writing books. So then again, I do not believe that any person should have the right to just remove the books that are offensive to them at all. I believe that if they find a book that is offensive to them, then they should just ignore that it is there and respect that there are a lot of people out there who would want to or like to read those books. So I do not believe that there should be any censorship in libraries at all. It is not anyone's fault that people find books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive to them. In conclusion, I have explained my views on censorship in libraries and whether people should have the right to remove books from a shelf just because they found them offensive. As I have stated before, there should not be any censorship in libraries at all. I understand that people find things offensive, but they should just ignore them and respect the diverse reading preferences of others. Once again, I pose the question: do you believe that people should have the right to remove a book from a shelf just because they found it offensive, and what are your views on censorship in libraries?
230	3207	2	3	Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive? Books, movies, magazines, and music are forms of expression that are made to relay a message, express a point of view, or perhaps state an opinion. Since everyone has a different point of view, what one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are already rated. Movies are rated from @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are rated from child - friendly to adult - oriented, and music, if explicit, has a parental advisory sticker. People just need to follow these ratings. For instance, if a four - year - old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie, the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not of the appropriate age. People often bring up the point that maybe a child could pick up an adult book or magazine in a store and start reading it. The solution to this problem is simple. Stores that sell these items can create a separate room and label it the adult section. Install cameras nearby so that if a youngster tries to enter the adult section, they will be caught. Another option is to put a desk in front of the adult section and require an ID for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a person's dreams, hopes, desires, fantasies, and heart. They should not be denied the opportunity to be available just because a person deems the content unfit. And most importantly, if a piece of content offends someone, they should simply choose not to read it. In summary, people should simply follow the rating rules and take necessary precautions. If all of these rules are followed, then businesses and libraries should have no problems keeping everybody safe and happy, while still allowing for the free flow of diverse forms of expression.
231	3208	2	3	If I could remove anything from the shelves of libraries, I wouldn't. After all, libraries are repositories of diverse knowledge and ideas. Would you rather your kids learn things from the objective facts in books or from the often unreliable chatter of friends? Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc., and deciding what goes onto the shelves is a complex matter. Most of the materials on library shelves are there either for enjoyment or to provide information. Granted, you wouldn't want a five - year - old reading a book made for adults, but as kids grow older, they have to learn various things. You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere, including college and into their adult life.   Books provide facts and more reliable information than what you can hear from people. For instance, if all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a comprehensive report on those things? The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share, and it could also help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge. If someone were to find a book offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up. Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes, and something you find offensive isn't offensive to others. Taking a single book from the shelves would result in others taking books off the shelves, and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves.   If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy, and their brains wouldn't function correctly. You'd be taking one of their rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't. What kids read is shaping their minds for their future. If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they wouldn't read or listen to music or do anything enjoyable anymore. Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to.   So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another. Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere. Someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them. In one way or another, something provides information for people, and libraries should be a place where this free flow of information is maintained.
232	3209	2	3	Hi my name is @PERSON1. I have a couple of interesting topics that I would like to talk to you about. Lately, I have been hearing a lot of people talking about libraries taking a large amount of their stuff off the shelves. Well, I think that the libraries around the world have a vast amount of valuable information inside of them. If we started taking information out of them, then what would be the point in having them? I firmly believe that everything in libraries is very important, and who is to say that everybody wants this to happen?   The one thing that I don't really think that libraries need in them is movies. After all, pretty much every movie has a book that goes with it or is essentially the same thing. Now, let's get on with the whole offensive thing. I think everyone should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say, even if it is hurtful.   In fact, I believe that the more people read about what others are saying about them, the less that they are going to care. They will eventually become so used to it that they won't even know what the critics are talking about. If there was one thing that I could tell the world, it would be don't be offended by what people say to you. We should respect the diversity of opinions and information available in libraries and not let a few sensitive issues lead to unnecessary censorship.
233	3210	2	3	You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, not all of them are responsible enough to handle certain things. You could talk to them all day about what's responsible to do and what not to do, and they will go out and do what they want anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certain things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted from what truly matters in their teenage years, and that is schoolwork.   If school systems allowed there to be offensive or inappropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be... well... 'distracted'. And when I say inappropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for school. You would like to think that they would possibly save such things for when they checked out and went home and did their work first. But, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do most of the time is avoid schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals.   School work is a very important thing in teenagers' lives, and I feel that when they are in school, they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do it at home. Offensive books should not be there to only distract the teenager from school. It's unnecessary. But with public libraries, it's a whole new story.   I believe that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go there on their own free will. I know I personally go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. It's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because it's not only teenagers who go there, but adults do too. It is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because you never know what someone is there for. The library is for people to go and read, whether it's just for the fun of it or for school.   Not everyone is responsible, especially not all teenagers. So that's why I personally believe offensive or inappropriate materials should not be allowed in school libraries, but allowed in public libraries. Although equal rights and freedom are necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from it. Schoolwork is the key to their future, and we should do our best to ensure that teenagers stay focused on it during their school years.
234	3211	2	3	All people have the same right to read, listen, and watch different materials. To be censored should be no one's choice but your own. For someone else to tell you what and what not to read is, in my opinion, very wrong to do. If we were to censor everything we did, we would have a city and a nation that would stagnate slowly.   Any given word can offend any certain person. The people that such words offend are, in my opinion, the ones holding us back from fully expressing ourselves. The colorful words that we use can be offensive to one person yet perfectly fine to another. It all depends on the individual that likes or dislikes the word or readings. In my observations, people who dislike reading because of its harsh and colorful words are most often those who do not fully express themselves and are much more sensitive.   I think this also goes against freedom of speech. We were given that right, so why wouldn't we use it? Why would people not want us to express ourselves? I have no idea why any person would want to take books, music, movies, and magazines away from us. If everything went by one man's rule of what to and not to read, we would down - grade as a country and stagnate.   Therefore, I strongly advise not to take any books off the shelves. The majority of the people agree with me to not be censored. Only the sensitive people who are offended will just make their own choice not to pick the book off the shelves, not to listen to music, and not to pick up the magazine. The right is ours, and that's how it should stay. We should respect the diversity of expression and not let the sensitivities of a few limit the access to information and entertainment for the many.
235	3212	2	3	Censorship. It's a word that everyone has heard, but do people truly know what it means or how it affects them? In the past, books have been censored by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful. How could they say that they knew what was best for their people? What gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read? In today's society, we still have to deal with censorship issues. There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books. Censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well. No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another. Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to.   Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read. Some people like mysteries, while others like to read romantic books. If we allow people to censor what we read, then how can we say that there is a book for everyone to like? If libraries censored every book that might offend someone else, then there would not be any books left for anyone to read. For example, certain religious books might offend people of other religions, but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves. If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended. Then no one would be able to find books about their religion, and no one would benefit.   Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world. Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate. If we only focus on the person who hates it and get rid of movies based on the people who hate them, then the people who love the movies will suffer for it. People who love horror movies probably hate comedies. This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because there are some people who dislike them. It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them.   In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love. We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like. If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music. It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music. It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody. People would be even more offended than before in that case.   There will always be unhappy people in the world. We should not resort to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try to make people happy. Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy. It makes the people who would like the items that have been censored mad. We should not do that. We should allow people to pick what they like. If a person wants to read something, they should be allowed. If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them? The small number of people who dislike what others enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it. We should uphold the principle of freedom of choice in media consumption and not let censorship stifle creativity and diversity.
236	3213	2	3	I believe that some materials are indeed offensive to some individuals, but that alone shouldn't grant them the right to demand these materials be removed from the shelves. No, I firmly do not agree with taking such materials off the shelves because people can simply overlook them and choose not to read them. Some people, especially in @MONTH1, might think certain materials are offensive, but they should understand that these materials may not be directed towards them. Magazines are a different case as they often have people's faces on the front cover, which can be inappropriate. Some of those individuals have families, and they wouldn't want their loved ones to see their face on the front cover of a magazine. Katherine Paterson's quote pertains to the desire to remove books from the shelves to prevent children from being tempted to read them. If this is the intention, I think it's not the right approach. Some of the books people are trying to take off the shelves could be the very ones that someone can relate to or learn from. Whether you want your children to read these books or not, they might still find them and wonder why they've never seen them before, leaving parents at a loss for words. Libraries serve as a valuable resource for people who wish to read and discover new things. If you take a book off the shelf, it could be the exact book someone desperately needs. Don't be the person who deprives a child of learning. You never know who might be searching for the item you've removed. And if you take it away, they, especially in @MONTH1, may never find it. Some people believe that reading certain materials can influence one's behavior, but you can't solely blame it on reading. That's like claiming your favorite color is lime green just because it's @PERSON2's favorite color. It's neither true nor reasonable. Imagine if your parents hid a book or something else from you. You'd be angry and wonder why. It would make you eager to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it, you might not even want to read it because your parents allowed you to see it, and you might lose interest. You have the right to decide what your children read, watch, and listen to. But don't shield them from what you find offensive. Consider this: the music, movie, or book you're hiding from them could hold the answers to many things. It could help them determine the path they want to take or the one they want to avoid. Either way, it could contribute to their success in life. So, why not take the risk? It could even benefit you as well.
237	3214	2	3	Censorship in the world we live in today is a truly fascinating concept. With the rise of social media, we now have vibrant communities of people eager to have their voices heard, and others are actively listening. We can now access a vast amount of knowledge from people all around the globe, enabling us to gain insights into what's truly happening in countries like @LOCATION2, where media censorship is considered an act of treason. So, what should we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Let's begin by examining an argument that has been debated for a long time: library censorship. Today, it's almost a necessity for cities to have public libraries to be regarded as proper cities. Public libraries, and the funding they require, aren't part of the @ORGANIZATION1. Nevertheless, they have become integral parts of our neighborhoods, serving as reliable sources of knowledge and culture. One public library can be a repository of various resources, including historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non - fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other forms of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries, even with the widespread use of the internet, remain important places for us, as city residents, to socialize and learn. Libraries today often carry books that were once on the 'banned books' list, but that doesn't mean books aren't being banned from libraries. Libraries are generally family - oriented institutions, and as they're funded by the public, they're required to adhere to the moral and ethical standards of the local residents. This means that there isn't a single, 'national banned books list', but there are many discrepancies throughout @LOCATION1 in the process of banning books. As culture increasingly delves into more controversial materials, libraries face a difficult decision: keep up with the times and offer more questionable and controversial reading materials, or remain stuck in the past and rely on the senior generation to stay afloat. Introducing new and fresh literary materials into the library will attract more people, whether they're young adults or older adults looking to stay in touch with the current world. One major controversy regarding books in public libraries is the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation emerges, exposed to music lyrics from artists like '@ORGANIZATION2' or '@ORGANIZATION3', we're entering an era where younger kids are learning about sex. Today's authors have recognized this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, though not detailed encounters. I believe this is acceptable because as generations progress, we'll realize that education about sex, including safe sex, birth control, @CAPS1 prevention and testing, is far more important than keeping children in the dark. Encouraging young adults to engage with books and continue learning outside of school is a more significant issue we should address, rather than creating baseless arguments against new reading materials in public libraries. Public libraries are the heart of learning outside of school in many communities, both large and small. Given this, how can anyone genuinely think it's wise to stop including new books that would attract new patrons? Even from a commercial business perspective, this makes no sense. It's like turning people away simply because you have a narrow view of the future and refuse to consider others' opinions. So, why is there a debate about including new knowledge? Isn't it obvious that we, as a nation, should show the world that we're not living in the past? That we're indeed the future of the world, and our young adults will receive the best education by not only learning in schools but also by being avid readers and, consequently, active learners.
238	3215	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive? My personal stance is that they generally should not be removed, unless they are extremely inappropriate and children should not be exposed to them. That is my opinion because when readers enter the library, a book that seems offensive to us might not be offensive to them and their personal standards. And if it is offensive to them, well, they are the ones checking it out, so they clearly know what they're getting into. Therefore, we should not remove books from the shelves just because they are offensive, as what's offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. In fact, my opinion is somewhat divided. If the movies and library materials are inappropriate, adults should be the only ones allowed to purchase them. That is my personal view, and many others, especially in @MONTH1, may have different opinions on this subject. But I simply think everything should remain on the shelves. Movies should be sold to adults only, and this approach can strike a balance between respecting different sensibilities and providing access to a wide range of materials. By allowing adults to make their own choices while protecting children from inappropriate content, we can maintain the integrity and diversity of the library's collection.
239	3216	2	3	Libraries are a wonderful place that offers people of all ages the opportunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music free of charge for a specific period of time. As people grow older, they often start engaging with materials that they wouldn't want their children to be exposed to. Since books are typically read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books generally should not be taken from the shelves, and only extremely inappropriate movies and music should be removed from the library. Books have always been a means for people to escape from their daily lives and immerse themselves in a fictional world. Usually, when people read a book, they do it alone, unless they're part of a reading group discussing specific books. If someone wants to read a book that is inappropriate for their children, they should be allowed to do so. It won't harm the children just because their parents are reading inappropriate topics. The only harm would occur if a child stumbles upon the book that should have been stored more securely. For example, @PERSON1 read the book 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', which contained some content that was inappropriate for a child, but it wasn't overly offensive. @PERSON1 would read the book privately while finding it in the adult section of the library, far away from children. This is how the situation should be handled. However, if a library places adult books near children's books, they need to re - arrange the layout to prevent kids from accidentally entering the adult section. Books can be kept away from children if they're stored properly, but movies and music can't be hidden in the same way. Movies and music are great ways to unwind after a long day, but it becomes a problem when kids are around. Keeping kids out of the room where a movie is being watched or music is being played is extremely difficult. Whether it's actually watching the movie or hearing it through their bedroom wall, it's hard to shield them. Music can be listened to through headphones, but what if a @CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent to wait in the car for their parents? The parents might tell their child to start the car, and the music will start playing. The movies and music are from the library, a place where children expect to find only appropriate materials. Exposing them to such inappropriate content can ruin their positive perception of the library. Libraries need to either eliminate all inappropriate content related to movies and music or, if it's an important part of their collection and they can't get rid of it, store it as far away as possible from the children. As mentioned earlier, libraries need to remove all content that has the potential to be exposed to children and corrupt their innocent minds. Libraries are places where kids can have fun choosing books to read, not places where parents can pick up items that might have a negative impact on a child's development. By taking appropriate measures to separate inappropriate materials from children, libraries can continue to serve as valuable educational and entertainment resources for all ages.
240	3217	2	3	Whispers and comments fill the room as people make their way through the library. The criticism of books and materials neatly stacked on the shelves is often carried out by those who find them offensive. In my opinion, there is no valid reason to argue about what should or should not be removed from the libraries. Reflecting on my own views and those of the library, it's clear that there is a diverse interest in materials from all over the world. The reason I don't support the removal of materials is related to what Katherine Paterson mentioned in her passage. It states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1, everyone has a unique perspective, and they may view something differently from others. This often leads to people taking offense to a material or book they see, misinterpreting its meaning. However, another person may not find the same book offensive but could be offended by something else in a different book. To clarify this argument, I'll share my own experience. One time, I went to the library and noticed books and magazines that had a significant impact on colored people. They described what it would be like if slavery still existed and if equality wasn't taught or practiced. In this situation, the reaction of colored people can vary. Some may be relieved and interested, knowing they are now free. On the other hand, many may feel uncomfortable bringing up the issue of equality in the present or future. They may prefer to forget about the past rather than having books and magazines continue to publish stories about it. Again, this argument can go either way, meaning one less book may be on the shelf, or many new ones may be added. When people think of materials, they usually associate them with an event, a time period, or a symbol. This can also affect the censorship in libraries. The way people want to engage with the things they're interested in can often be found in the library. However, if someone believes there is no place for a particular material to be displayed, they may remove it. This, in turn, disappoints those who thought the material was valuable and prevents them from finding the interest they were seeking. Another argument people may have is that libraries are public places. This should influence what they can or cannot share in their readings, materials, and movies. People may think they have the right to argue or take offensive actions. But it's important to note that people can also restore materials. Instead of selectively choosing what to keep or remove, I believe everything should be left as it is. People should simply go to the section that interests them and ignore the rest. My experience and observations on this argument highlight why we all should approach the issue of censorship in libraries appropriately. While it won't solve all the problems, it will prevent the removal of materials that could play a crucial role in educating children, teachers, and everyone else in the future. By respecting different perspectives and maintaining a diverse collection, libraries can continue to be a source of knowledge and inspiration for all.
241	3218	2	3	I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive. First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is unique, with distinct preferences. This means that people read and prefer different types of books, magazines, movies, and music. For instance, one person might enjoy reading philosophical books, delving deep into complex ideas and theories, while another might prefer romance comedy books, seeking light - hearted and enjoyable stories. If the library officials were to take the philosophical books off the shelves, the person who has a passion for philosophy would be left without suitable reading material. Although there are magazines and movies about philosophy available, the experience of learning from a well - written philosophical book, like @ORGANIZATION2's profound work or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1, is far more in - depth and immersive. I had a similar experience with my friend. She was a big fan of horror movies, while I preferred historical ones. The horror movie she was eager to watch was not in the library, and it turned out that the library had removed all horror movies as they were not popular in that area. My friend was extremely disappointed. The library did have historical movies, but I ended up watching them alone. So, libraries should not take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.  Second, the term 'offensive' in this context is ambiguous, having multiple meanings. What might seem 'offensive' to one person may not seem offensive to another. For example, a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover could be offensive to a child due to the picture and the use of 'adult' words. However, that same cover might be interesting to a young adult who is into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2. In this case, the concept of 'offensive' is only applicable to the child, not to the young adult, even though it's the same material. So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so. The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines. The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material.  Finally, I believe that people have the freedom to choose the types of books, magazines, movies, and music they want. After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning. So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from their shelves. People should be able to select materials according to their own interests and personalities. Whether it's for intellectual growth, relaxation, or simply for fun, the choice should be theirs. So, in conclusion, libraries should not have any material removed from their shelves just because it is found offensive by some.
242	3219	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.' (Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like, anyone can. That might seem like the right approach, but I firmly disagree. I don't think people should be allowed to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They have the option not to take the book.  I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive, they simply don't have to look at it or check it out. There are bound to be other people who enjoy that book. Liking a book is a matter of personal opinion. For example, if someone doesn't like your outfit, you're not going to burn it or throw it away because it's just one person's opinion. The same principle applies to movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone has different tastes, so there should be a wide variety of books available.  When you don't like a book, I believe the only time it would be appropriate for you to take that book off the shelf is if it's in your own house. In your private space, you can do whatever you want with the book, whether it's throwing it away or storing it. However, in a public setting, things are different. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety - five percent voted to get rid of it, then perhaps it would be okay. But you can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things; you need to consider the whole community.  I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, and I didn't think that was a good idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top - picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it, they should have simply told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go into the school and say they don't like that book and take it off the shelf. It's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'.  Choosing what book to read is a personal opinion. You don't have to read a book you dislike. People have diverse preferences, so it's not fair for them to be denied the opportunity to read the book they like just because other people don't like it. What if someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf? In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and not let a few people's dislikes lead to the removal of books from public spaces.
243	3220	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I do not believe that. Simply because if one person is offended by a book or other materials in a library, someone else will surely argue because they like the thing that was taken out due to that person's beliefs and values.  I believe that if you don't like what is available in the library you visit, you have a choice. You can either stop going to that library or simply ignore the offensive material. There is a lot of racism present in books, songs, and magazines, but we don't just remove them all. You can choose not to listen to the offensive music or read the offensive books. If you want to protest something that goes against your beliefs or offends you, then by all means, go ahead. It's important to stand up for yourself.  I remember when I was about @NUM1, I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend. The guy @CAPS4 dad invited to come was @PERSON1. He isn't a racist, but he has a habit of joking about how people dress and sometimes his comments cross the line, including using racist names. We usually tolerate his behavior. So, when we went to check in at the hotel, the person at the check - in/check - out counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We paid for our room without any problems and patiently waited for @PERSON1 to step up and ask for a room. @CAPS4 father noticed that @PERSON1 was just standing there, staring at the person behind the counter. @PERSON1 then looked at us, smiled, and pulled out a pamphlet from his shoulder bag and handed it to the girl behind the counter. I have no idea what the pamphlet said or what kind of pictures were on it, but when he gave it to her, she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, flipped him off, and then walked to the back and got a man.  As this rather large man walked around the counter towards @PERSON1, @CAPS4 father stepped in. @CAPS4 dad started trying to talk to the man, but the man seemed so focused on @PERSON1 that he barely noticed @CAPS4 dad. @PERSON1 said, 'Look, I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' @CAPS4 mom took me and @CAPS4 brothers up to our room and tried to get @CAPS4 father to come with us. But he promised us he'd be right up.  A good half an hour later, @CAPS4 dad came through the door with @PERSON1 close behind. I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and @CAPS4 father said it was an AIDS pamphlet he got from a rest stop. I looked at @PERSON1 and asked him why he did it. His reply was that it was just an inside joke about 'blacks' and AIDS. I was quite disappointed in him and decided not to pay much attention to him after that. Instead, I talked to @CAPS4 father. @CAPS4 dad said that the reason the girl got so upset was that her mother had died from AIDS just a year ago. Of course, @PERSON1 had no idea about this. But I'm sure he learned his lesson. He should have just left her alone.  So, you see, these kinds of situations are problems, but we don't just remove people or things because of one incident. We should learn to tolerate differences and not let one person's actions lead to the removal of something that others might find valuable. In conclusion, we should not have materials removed from the shelves just because someone else doesn't like them.
244	3221	2	3	Do I think materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the book shelf if they are found offensive? Yes, I do. The reason is that if something is offensive to young kids and other people, there's no point in keeping it on the shelves.  If the materials in the library don't have anything to do with learning, they don't belong there. There are certain types of books that are suitable for kids, and if there are materials intended for adults, they should be placed in a separate section away from the kids' section. This way, kids won't be exposed to inappropriate content.  In the case of music and movies, there should be no materials that contain any form of violence. Kids today are already exposed to too much violence in the world around them. The only music or movies that should be available in the library are those that have learning materials in them. For example, educational music that teaches kids about history, science, or languages, or movies that have positive moral lessons and educational value.  So, I think you should put books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelf only if they contain learning materials and things that would inspire kids to do something positive in their lives. By doing this, the library can serve as a place of learning and growth, rather than a source of offensive or inappropriate content. In conclusion, libraries should carefully curate their collections to ensure that all materials are beneficial and appropriate for the users.
245	3222	2	3	I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because what might be offensive to one person might not even come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies, and some music that have historical value. They might seem offensive to some, but for certain races or cultures, they are an important part of history. For example, a book that depicts the struggles of a particular ethnic group during a certain period might be seen as offensive by those who don't understand the context, but for the members of that ethnic group, it is a record of their past.  What might be historical or informational to one person could be offensive to another, and vice versa. If everyone had the chance to go into the biggest library and remove the materials that they found offensive, the library would end up with very few, if any, books. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This means that if parents or teenagers were to take 'offensive' material off the shelf, there would be nothing left for others to read.  A lot of things are considered offensive because of religious beliefs, but not everyone has the same religion, or any religion at all. Just as religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring were to occur in public libraries, I'm sure there would be protests and possibly riots. People have the right to access a wide range of information and different perspectives.  People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man. Well, if we take books and movies off the shelves that show what he did, history is more likely to repeat itself. There are many bad things in history that we read about today, like gangs. If we don't read about the wrongs they do or see movies that depict what it would be like to be a gang member, there might be an increase in gang activity and membership. We need to learn from history, and that includes the negative aspects.  In conclusion, removing books, magazines, movies, etc., from the shelves based on the idea of 'offensiveness' is a dangerous path. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the importance of historical records. By keeping these materials available, we allow people to make their own choices and learn from different experiences, ensuring that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past.
246	3223	2	3	There are various types of books, movies, magazines, and tape recorders available in libraries. Books can fall into the categories of fiction or non - fiction. However, books or any other items in the library can be offensive to some people, while to others, it's just an ordinary book to read. So, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf.   Who decides which books, movies, magazines, and tape recorders are added to the library? The answer is the customers at the library. The authors of the books or items do not make this decision. The authors simply create the works and leave the choice to the library patrons. No one can blame the authors for the content being offensive to some. Also, there are different kinds and different types of writers or artists. Writers and artists invest their time in completing a novel or series for us to read or hear. People should not take books or other sources too seriously because they can be either non - fiction or fiction.  My next example of why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is that an item might offend someone but not others. For example, the topic of slavery can be offensive to a colored person, but to others, it is just a historical event. People need to know what happened in the past through historical events. People should read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. Therefore, people should not try to remove such items.  If a child checks out a book and their parents allow it, it is the parents' fault. It is their fault because parents let their child check the items out. Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources, they can complain, but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf. As I said before, one person might not like the book or other source, but another person might like it.  Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not for removing books or other sources off the shelves. By keeping a diverse collection, libraries can cater to the different interests and needs of all their patrons.
247	3224	2	3	Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on censorship at the library.  When you walk into a library, I assume you would expect a public area where you can freely read books and check them out. But what happens when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion, censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects children and young adults from viewing things that are meant for adult eyes only, such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases, pornography. Censorship in the library plays an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book. However, when there is an adults - only section for books, movies, music, etc., it alleviates a lot of people's concerns about their kids seeing inappropriate things. For instance, if twelve - year - old @PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it, he can check it out and play the game without his parents' knowledge of the incident. With censorship, we can eliminate such problems.  Now, like I stated before, censorship is okay when needed because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, it's also the parents' fault for why their kids engage in certain behaviors, like letting their kids listen to music with heavy swearing or giving them full access to a personal computer. Such things are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is okay when needed, I mean that people sometimes censor important information because of an event that has happened in the past. Another example, if you're in ninth grade and you enter a library looking for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie, but it's too graphic, the student is left without a proper source and must gain access to a computer.  Now that you have my opinions and beliefs, you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing, but it can also be a bad one. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly, it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is sometimes out of control, but if maintained properly, we can use it for many positive things and build a great community as well as a better country. In conclusion, we should approach censorship with a balanced mindset, using it when necessary but not over - doing it.
248	3225	2	3	Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us. This self - awareness is an important part of personal growth. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that might be found offensive in some way should be removed from the shelves.  If you think about it, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people might not be found offensive by another person or group of people. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be hardly any books left.  Writing is a means of self - expression. Authors write to express how they feel, or to tell a story about themselves or someone else. Some authors might do this in a very offensive manner. Others might try to sugar - coat how they feel about a person or a certain idea. Either way, you could still find something about the writing to be offensive.  In conclusion, I feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves. If we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left. By keeping these books, we preserve the diversity of thought and expression, which is essential for a well - informed society.
249	3226	2	3	Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it, but the truth is, if the kids really want to look at it, they are going to find a way. So, I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves. However, sometimes things can offend more than one person, in which case they might need to be removed.  Take music for example. There might be explicit lyrics in songs, but that doesn't make them terrible or unworthy of being on the shelf. Music is ubiquitous, and if someone tells you can't listen to it because of a few words, then you are likely to find a way to listen to it.  Movies might be different. For some movies, you do have to be a certain age to watch them, and that is because of the offensive material. But still, some people go to see these movies anyway, knowing that there will be offensive material in them, and then they complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not. If you choose not to, there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.  Books might be the only exception. Many people read books and many enjoy it, but many people also find books offensive. With music and movies, people know they are fictional, just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. That is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something, it won't be hard to convince somebody else.  There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something and being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it, and if you choose to keep reading or listening, it is your decision. We should respect individual choices and the diversity of content available.
250	3227	2	3	Censorship in libraries, in my view, isn't a good idea. Libraries nowadays have a lot of offensive language in their books. If someone were to take all of the books like that out of the library, then the library wouldn't have many books left. Music is the same way. All music nowadays might have some offensive words in it, and that's just something people nowadays have to accept.  I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parents might not like the idea of their libraries having offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parents don't want their children to read those books, then they need to choose their children's books. But I think taking all the offensive books off the shelves isn't very smart. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.  Some of the best books and music nowadays have offensive content like drugs, language, sex, gangs, and much more. But sometimes, books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid going down the wrong path. So, if you take those books off the shelves and prevent your child from listening to that music, maybe your child could end up doing some of those things. They really wouldn't know the side - effects and bad things that could come out of those things. Some of the top - selling music and books have offensive materials in them, and why would you not let your kid read them because of a few choice words? I know some of this material could be bad for people, but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.  If there are books you don't want to read, then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everything that has some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think it's good for your child to read. It's not fair to people who might enjoy those books to not have the luxury of reading those books anymore because a few parents got mad about a book. Some of the old books have a lot of racism in them, and you might actually read some of them in school for a class. Those books might also have bad language in them. Taking those books away from us might take away our education, and we won't be able to learn from those books as we should.  So, I think that censorship in libraries is just a horrible idea. It can take away the lessons we could learn and our education, which are essential for us to be successful in life. By allowing a diverse range of materials in libraries, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.
251	3228	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial issue. Many people believe that it is the right thing to do, while many others strongly disagree with it. Censorship should not occur in libraries for several reasons. All people have freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1, and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive, you are taking away that right. Authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public. Censorship is acceptable in some circumstances, but what is censored should not be decided by the government.  First of all, freedom of speech is very important to the people of the @LOCATION1. If this freedom were to be taken away, it would definitely not go unnoticed. When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished. For example, what if an atheist wrote a book saying that @CAPS1 wasn't real? Many @CAPS2 would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries. Just because one group of people do not like the topic, message, or theme of a book does not mean that it should be taken out of a library. A library is a place where all books have a chance to be read, not a place where people get to pick and choose what they want there because of their beliefs.  Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowledged by the public. Of course, there will be books that are more popular than others, but at the same time, there will also be books that are neglected, not because of the quality of the writing, but because of the topic the author chose to write about. There is no reason to have a whole community ignore an author's work just because a large group of people do not agree with what it says. In that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book, you will find a number of people that would read the book. Just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them. The author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged.  Last of all, censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances. It just depends on what ways censoring is used. For example, many parents do not want their children reading, listening, or watching certain things. The parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read, listen, or watch, not a large group of people. Many parents have different standards, and what some parents find acceptable for their children @MONTH1 appalls others. So, there could never be a set standard for what is acceptable and not acceptable without creating a large amount of controversy. Once that child becomes an adult, they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library. There should be certain limits, though. For example, a person must be the age of seventeen or older to rent a '@CAPS3' rated movie. This is the same age a person must be to get into a '@CAPS3' rated movie without parental supervision. Some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries, but other than that, the decisions should be left up to the person.  Censorship in libraries will always be changing. Sometimes it will be in effect, while at other times it will not. People of the @LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech, and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right. The author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves. Censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them. Parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others. In the end, a balanced approach that respects individual rights and parental responsibilities is crucial for the proper functioning of libraries.
252	3229	2	3	Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it banned from all local stores? Well, I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the sheer distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book. I personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to. The fact that a book is found offensive or off - putting to most is no reason to completely ban the book from store and library shelves alike. Because if there is @CAPS5 one person that could educationally benefit from reading this book, then they should at least have a chance to obtain that information.  One of the most important things to remember while considering this topic is that no matter what the source is or what it conveys, there will always be someone that feels the book is just too graphic or hits too close to home for them to stand. In other cases, however, there are books that are not proper for younger children or the faint of heart, such as the book series 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', in which people are thrown into an arena and forced to fight each other for their very lives. Most people who are above the age of twelve can handle almost all of the 'offensive sources' that are attainable by the public, but there are some cases that @CAPS5 adults cannot handle, such as the famous book that @PERSON1 wrote in incarceration called ' @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' Even in those extreme cases, most adults can still read.  Now that my argument has been said and you know my point of view is that it varies from person to person whether they can handle a book, I ask you if you feel the same way that I do. My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive, they should simply avoid this book. We do live in @LOCATION1, the land of the free. I think we can handle a little controversy over a book or magazine. I do hope that in the future, we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over - reaction to something offensive. I believe that we will see a day that no book will be banned from the shelves, so that our children @MONTH1 can gain the knowledge that is contained by those fragile pages of paper. This way, everyone can have access to diverse ideas and grow intellectually.
253	3230	2	3	I think that all of the books, movies, and other forms of media should not be censored because people have a right to know what they want to know or see. They need to learn from books so that people can learn from history and so that @CAPS1 war @NUM1 won't happen again. The library is a place for freedom to read, to do what you want, and to look up information.  In the newspaper and magazines, people like to know what happens in the @CAPS1 or to people, whether it's bad or not, because by knowing, they can avoid similar bad situations. Some people might think that others should not read or watch something, but who are they to tell others what to do? People can make their own decisions.  In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of access to information. Censorship may limit our ability to learn and grow. By allowing free access to various forms of media, we can better understand the world and make more informed decisions. We should ensure that our knowledge - seeking is not restricted, and instead, we should use the available resources to feed our minds and develop as a society.
254	3231	2	3	I can think of several books that I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. As soon as I saw what I was going to be writing about, this one flashed in my head like lightning. The book that @CAPS1 I'm choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'  The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl who grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because she knew that it was only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl. That's all she wanted out of life. She sat and thought, is that just a little too much to ask for?  After a few years had passed by, she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for her father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind. Her mother always pumped it in her head that her father was up to no good and that she would be better off without him there. But she went on the hunt for her father by faith in the lord.  After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that she just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the answers that she needed to solve her heartache and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world, her father would be waiting for her.  It was just before the sun was beginning to set when she noticed a little old southern bell sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead, with tears filled in her eyes. Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear, why must you be crying?' @CAPS8, with the lump in her throat, she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with 'yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed.' That's when her face began to glow.  She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing to her. She was nervous, but with the help of her @CAPS9, she sat and talked with her father. Her father told her that he had written her a letter every day. That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that she had never received a letter from him in her entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.  After @NUM2 years had passed by, she finally found her father. The truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughter's life because the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going against law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because he was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then, there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.  The reason I choose this book was because when I was young, my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me, and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom or dad is tough. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in your heart. Sometimes, the bleed still seems to find its way through. After reading the book, I always wondered why they called her'she.' They called her'she' because she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.  Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentage of single - parent families nowadays than before. Just like in the book, most kids take the blame for a parent not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through. Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?  All these children want is to know they are loved and that someone cares about them. If we are going to have these types of books, then there needs to be a form for the parents to fill out giving permission. If they are over age, then that's totally fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it rather than going through these feelings alone. In the end, we should protect children from unnecessary emotional distress while also respecting the rights of older individuals to access different types of literature.
255	3232	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading.  I do believe that if it's a book you're not supposed to get, if it's not for your age group, don't get it. Some libraries contain books that are highly not appropriate for children. They have sections for adults and children to check out books. Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books. The library is a place with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book.  When I first went to the library for the first time, I didn't know what book to check out. So, the librarian showed me my section by indicating my age group. By then, I was checking out books that were appropriate for my age. Magazines I didn't care too much about; I just wanted to read a whole book.  In conclusion, whenever you need a book, go to your section and make sure the book is appropriate for you. Feed your mind with knowledge that suits your age and mental capacity. This way, you can have a positive and educational experience in the library.
256	3233	2	3	Censorship In a well - stocked library, there is indeed a plethora of books to choose from. These books span a wide range, from colorful and engaging children's books to complex and thought - provoking adult ones. It's truly nice to know that you have numerous options and the freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read. Censorship, by definition, is the act of censoring a piece of material so that it is not legally or publicly available. If a book was censored because of the contents inside, it would naturally bring into question other books or media related to it. I firmly believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored in a library, the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people. Some people write books and songs as a means to express themselves or to make a living. If a book is taken out of a library, other libraries will have to follow suit and remove it as well, and they won't even consider buying it. Some people simply wish to get their thoughts out and share their message with others. Censorship, in a way, stops the free flow of what people can learn. Another crucial part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will inevitably look into the reason for its removal. It gets people thinking about what other books might also be considered offensive. The reason why one book is removed could potentially relate to another book and could lead to that one being removed too. Since censorship is probably mostly based on opinion, there is no clear - cut boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't. With censorship, you are essentially stripping the freedom of the press away from people. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have it censored later on, this might imply that we need new publishers, or that they too are interested in getting what people have to say out into the world. The boundary for censorship is highly opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is taken down, it only brings other ones into question. In conclusion, censorship in libraries restricts the free exchange of ideas and should be carefully re - evaluated to ensure that the rights of both creators and readers are protected.
257	3234	2	3	A library is a wonderful place to go when in need of solitude and peace, whether you're researching or simply reading for pleasure. There is no valid reason, other than someone's personal opinion, as to why certain materials should be removed from libraries. We, the people, have a fundamental right to read what others have composed through their thoughts and ideas. Certain materials may be offensive to different people, but for those who could use that material for research or for pleasure reading, it would not be fair to remove it. If certain materials were removed because of someone's action based on their personal or religious opinion, then those materials would not be available for those who would need to possess that information. Did anyone really think when they asked for the certain offensive material to be removed? If people did, they would realize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort into getting that information out to the world. How do you think that author would feel? You just had their best work pulled from the shelves because you think it is offensive. How would you feel if someone complained about one of your best pieces of writing and said that libraries cannot put it on their shelves because it's offensive? There has been certain material I have listened to or read that I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that reflects the society as we read it. Some of those people may have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things, maybe not even watch certain materials. But for others, that might be an important part of their livelihood. We can't just take materials off the shelves of libraries. That material is the life - blood of our society. If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that. For whoever reads this, remember that what we produce as media is who we are, what we do, and what we live for. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and the rights of all individuals to access information, and refrain from removing materials from libraries based on personal or religious biases.
258	3235	2	3	Why Censorship Is Bad? In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense. Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there. Everybody doesn't want their children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen. We just have to teach our kids what is good and what is bad. This goes for literary items too. We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what is right. I firmly think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive. I believe we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries. Nowadays, there is a lot of hard work that goes into creating music, movies, and books. If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended by that in itself. The people who worked on the movie or wrote that book put a great deal of time and effort into the piece. They spent countless hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get someone to film their movie idea. I think that it would be wrong to rule out pieces of great literature because behind every one of them, there is a person who put a lot of effort into that material. In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find offensive language or offensive gestures in it. The Da Vinci Code is a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says Jesus had a wife and had children. This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened; it is just a story full of conspiracy theories. You can still believe what you want and read this book. A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title is White Men Can't Jump. Many people hear this title and may not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminate against white people, but instead, it is a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball. Many things have offensive language, but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories. They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe. In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things. In our society, we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like whatever we want. Even though literary works might be offensive, some people like reading books like this. If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book. Even though it might be discriminatory against me, I could still love the book. There is always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it. Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them every day? In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a bad idea as it restricts the free flow of diverse ideas and stories, and we should embrace the variety of literary and media works available.
259	3236	2	3	Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine - bound papers, filled with everything from basic information about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and transport them to far - off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and information far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this information and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad information. There is only people who are not yet ready for the information they are about to obtain. So, the question arises: should these materials that open up doors to new mindsets, and evoke feelings, such as books, music, magazines, and movies, be censored? That answer is yes. First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiosity that needs to be maintained in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners and intelligent minds. If the information given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison their minds and twist them into something they were not yet ready to become. Secondly, information presented to kids too early can harm them physically. Children are born with the instinct to repeat what they observe. This is a primal instinct that humans will forever have and is essential for living life. So, take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes and actions, this can be very harmful to them physically. If a child experiences these things too soon, they will want to simply repeat what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed. Lastly, premature information can harm children mentally. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage than movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture whatever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher restrictions on music. Restrictions such as raising the age for purchase should be implemented. That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked. In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not believe that the materials that may be harmful or offensive should be removed as a whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to improve their restrictions, and even enact laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world, and it is our responsibility to protect them from inappropriate information.
260	3237	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials should be removed. I whole - heartedly believe that people should be able to have freedom of speech. I also firmly believe that if somebody has something on their mind, they should be able to say it. I always tell people to mean what you say and say what you mean. Now, if it's younger kids getting a hold of magazines and movies with inappropriate material in them, then yes, it should be censored, or they shouldn't be placed in places where younger kids can access them. For example, libraries could have separate sections for adult materials, clearly marked so that children are not exposed to them accidentally. This way, adults can still have access to the materials they want, while protecting the innocence of children. In conclusion, while freedom of speech is important, we also have a responsibility to protect the well - being of children, and appropriate censorship measures can strike a balance between these two important aspects.
261	3238	2	3	I honestly don't think anything offensive should be removed from libraries. Young children, in particular, don't really know what those offensive things mean. The library is the only good place for kids to find information or to discover a book that they enjoy. If you take things that, say in @MONTH1, seem offensive to some people; people are going to have a hard time finding any facts or anything they need. People use offensive language all the time, but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way. The library doesn't intentionally insult people. It just gives us facts about what we need to know about a person or anything like that. Some people don't know how to be mature when it comes to things like that. If they can't be mature about stuff like that, then they don't need to be in the library. I would understand if the intentions were to insult someone, but they're not. So why should the magazines, movies, books, and music be taken out of the library? That's just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information. Slavery is an offensive topic to colored people because they get called names that I will not say in this essay. Most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past. Honestly, I think people will be okay. They don't need to get all bent out of shape because they see something offensive. They just need to know that it wasn't intentionally done. In conclusion, keeping offensive materials in libraries allows for a more open and educational environment.
262	3239	2	3	I strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out of the library. It's not okay for you to say one thing, and then something your child found in the library says it's okay. For example, what if you were talking to your kids about not smoking and how it's bad for them and could potentially kill them. Would you like your child to say that they can smoke because all these characters in the book are smoking? No, that's just pure wrong. They shouldn't allow those kinds of books, music, movies, or magazines in the library. In high school, we were told by our parents that we should not smoke, do drugs, or anything like that. Sometimes it might be hard for teens to believe the things their parents talked to them about and how harmful they are to you and your body and would lead you to a troubled life down the road. Movies we watch today talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how they had fun driving a stolen car. It's wrong to talk about them that way because it gets teens to think it's okay for them to do it and nothing bad is going to happen. The media does a bad job of showing teens it's not right to do the things they see on TV. The library sets a bad example by allowing those kinds of books to sit on the shelves and thinking it's okay for people to read them and not take it offensively. I was reading a book that was talking about how they think it's okay to act racist against other people and say mean things and call them bad names. I really took that offensively because I wouldn't like someone calling me names and saying bad things about me because they think it's okay to say things like that and act that way. If books say all those things and the readers actually believe them, then we might have a problem on our hands because some people would take offense to it and cause a big issue over a small book, and some readers might think it's okay and cause an even bigger issue between people who take it offensively and people who don't. There are those people out there who think that it's okay for those kinds of books to be in the library and other people who think it's wrong and offensive. My personal view is that I think it's wrong to have those kinds of books at the library. We tell people how it's wrong to do bad things and how we hate certain things that are offensive to us, but if it says in the book that it's alright for those things to be happening or it's right to use those foul languages, it's just not right. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from libraries helps protect the values and well - being of the readers.
263	3240	2	3	What I think about all of this? To me, I really don't care because that's just who I am. And it's up to the parents if they want to remove the books off the shelf. If they believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves, they have the right to voice their concerns. Also, I don't think a book will ever really hurt anyone. I mean, it's just a book; it doesn't really matter. Next, I'm saying this because I don't really get offended by stuff like this argument. And also, if there's some stuff that kids shouldn't know about, then they should put those materials in the adult section and not in a place where kids can find it easily. They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids section. As a matter of fact, I don't know why they should remove stuff like movies. Because if they are trying to block them from kids to see, they are really dumb to do that. Because there are movies that children can watch. And some parents aren't going to let their children watch a @CAPS1 @NUM1 movie, or other movies that they're not supposed to see at their ages, unless their parents allow it. And that goes the same for the music. I don't know if they have bad music in the library. I don't see rap stuff in the library, like raps @CAPS2 and other stuff like it. So, in conclusion, these decisions about library materials should be left to parental discretion rather than blanket removals.
264	3241	2	3	Yes, I think they should take offensive books off the shelf because little kids read the books, and then they will probably be taught wrong from right. And if the books have violence in them, then they will think that it's right to act violently. For instance, young and impressionable kids might imitate the actions they read about in these books. They don't have the maturity to distinguish between right and wrong in such contexts. When they see characters in books engaging in violent or improper behavior, they may assume that it's an acceptable way to act. This can have a negative impact on their moral and social development. In conclusion, removing offensive and violent books from the library helps safeguard the proper upbringing of children.
265	3242	2	3	Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact that so many opinions are being conveyed through all the new media in the modern world. When a person has a view, they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it against those who oppose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented. Thus, the government, or any authority, may remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship, and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media. I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speech. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it in any way they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in any way. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts. Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see, then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to oppress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control. Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimination or anger; it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it, then instead of taking it away from everyone, they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child, over time like in @MONTH1, can decide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities. In conclusion, avoiding censorship allows for a more free and open - minded society where people can express themselves fully.
266	3243	2	3	Have you ever walked into the library with the hope of finding a good book, only to pick up a very vulgar and inappropriate article? Were you disappointed upon seeing what children could easily access, or did you simply place it back on the shelf, thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay, I aim to discuss both views on these censored books and explain why I believe they should be censored. People across the world vary greatly. In terms of color, race, size, shape, and personality, there isn't a single person on the planet who is exactly like another. So, why would they all share the same interest in reading or music? Some individuals enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip a beat, while others might prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way, everyone has their own opinion on what makes a great book. The same question arises when considering whether censored items should be allowed in a public library. Many people say yes, arguing that people have the right to choose what they do or do not observe or listen to. They claim, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is portrayed, then don't pick it up.' Others say no, stating, 'The library is supposed to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion, I side with the latter view, although I can also understand the opposing opinion. Regarding the opposing opinion, I can understand why some think that censored items are okay in libraries. If it's a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still creates a great story, I believe the book is acceptable as long as it's out of reach of children. Many people have different ideas about what 'censored' means, and there could be the consequence of losing many books. However, there are always consequences to every choice, whether good or bad. In my personal experience, I once took my ten - year - old sister to the library to borrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholarly and comprehends things quickly. Furthermore, when she found a book that she thought would be interesting, it turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it: what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe environment? To me, it's ridiculous to have to search every single book, CD, movie, or magazine for profanity to ensure it's safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed significantly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things, and I believe a big part of the reason is what they absorb through worldly materials. If the books and music they read and listen to are offensive and rude, what else would they know other than to follow what seems'more cool' than them. Therefore, I firmly believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed. When I sit back and think about what I'd want my kids to be reading and listening to, I wonder why people would even risk their children being negatively influenced by such materials. Why tempt them to be someone who reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to help their kids become the best versions of themselves, and I believe they have the right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential. Therefore, in the end, books should be censored!
267	3244	2	3	Some books are not suitable for kids. To address this, libraries could create a dedicated section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These uncensored books should not be allowed to be checked out by kids under the age of [NUM1] unless their parent or guardian gives permission. Some adults may not be concerned about what their kids read, but the library should take responsibility. I recall reading adult - oriented books at school. Back in elementary school, I remember checking out a lot of books, and I'm fairly certain they weren't adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books as it can help improve their reading skills. However, the content in these books is often not suitable for them. Creating a section for adults would be an effective way to prevent kids from accessing adult material. I firmly believe that this measure should be implemented in every library around the world. By doing so, we can ensure that children are exposed to age - appropriate reading materials and protect them from content that may not be suitable for their development.
268	3245	2	3	I think as long as a book isn't offensive or bad, people should continue reading it. If a book is offensive, I believe they shouldn't read it at all because it's not right to engage with such content. Also, I think if there is offensive music, it should be removed from the shelves. Parents or teachers wouldn't want their kids to learn bad words from books or music. After all, the influence of these materials on young minds can be significant. By keeping offensive books and music out of reach, we can create a more positive and healthy environment for children. In conclusion, it's essential to be selective about the reading and listening materials available, especially in settings where children are present.
269	3246	2	3	I do indeed believe that certain material should not be present in public libraries or places where young people can easily access it. Things such as pornographic material should not be out in the open where kids can stumble upon it. I think we'd all agree that kids don't need to be exposed to such content. Personally, I've been in a movie rental shop and seen some movies that my parents wouldn't want me to watch. Material like this should be stored away, out of sight, and only made available upon request. I also have a religious perspective on this matter. I know that it's a sin to look at things like porn, and the people in charge of the shop or library should respect my religion. [PERSON1] in the [CAPS1] says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble, then he will refrain from doing so. We need to adopt the same mindset in life. If something causes harm to others, we should avoid it. This is an issue we encounter daily, and I'm using pornographic material as an example because it's so widespread. For instance, when I'm standing in the [ORGANIZATION1] checkout line, I see the people magazines, and I find them very offensive. However, I will say that if you're old enough to live independently, you can choose to view whatever you want. But I find it intolerable to have these materials displayed where viewers who don't want to see them are forced to. In conclusion, it's the responsibility of those in charge of public spaces to ensure that inappropriate materials are not easily accessible, especially to the younger generation.
270	3247	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed from the shelf if they're found offensive? I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves even if they're considered offensive. Some of my reasoning is quite logical. If you're an avid reader, you'd want to read something that's true and interesting. Libraries contain books on every imaginable topic. They're primarily for learning and not intended to offend anyone. The reason I believe they shouldn't be removed is that everyone is equal, and not everyone has the same taste in reading. There should be offensive books because there are many kids who wouldn't want to pick up a book that's overly sanitized and not original in some way. Books are meant to be read for interest, laughter, and enjoyment. From speaking with some students at my school, I learned that when they're having a bad day, they turn on their music, and it helps them feel better. They say it makes the day easier, and they don't have to be depressed or dwell on what made them mad. Based on my own experience with books, magazines, music, and movies, I can attest to their helpfulness. I'm not a big reader, but I enjoy listening to music. Sometimes, songs can relate to you and make you feel like you're not alone. It also helps you learn how to cope with things you might not have been able to before, as it makes you feel relaxed. Just like some of my friends feel relaxed when they read a book. So, my point is that we're aware that there's offensive music and books out there. Does it bother us? No, because it actually helps us. It provides an escape from our daily stressful lives, and we can learn from books and songs how other people deal with their stress. We learn more than we feel offended by these materials. As you can tell, I'm a huge music fan, and there have been many offensive songs, but they don't bother me much. In conclusion, I hope I've given you a different perspective on why offensive music and books shouldn't be removed. They're amazing in their own way, providing us with space to learn, relax, and calm down. If you've never given them a chance, you should try it sometime.
271	3248	2	3	"No, I don't think books are offensive in libraries. Movies are a different kind of story. If your child is under the age of eighteen, they should not be renting a rated @CAPS1 movie, unless their parent approves of it. This is one reason why our public library should not have rated @CAPS1 movies. While I was in our public library one afternoon, I was looking at the movie selection, trying to decide which movie to choose. There was a little boy, who looked to be around nine or ten years old to me, but he had two movies in his hand. They were really good - it was an action - type movie. So, I asked the boy if I could see the movie really fast. He said yes, so I grabbed it from him and looked at the rating because from the title picture it looked gory. I noticed it was a rated @CAPS1 movie, and I told the boy, ""Did you know this is a rated @CAPS1 movie?"" and he said yes. I was surprised his parents would let him watch movies like that. If I was his age, I would never have been able to.  My second reason is why our public library should get rid of any kind of swimsuit magazines like @CAPS5 and/or @CAPS6 magazines. I was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like @CAPS5, swimsuit magazines and many more. Do you think your children should not have seen any kind of magazines like that in our library for the public to see? If a little girl went to the magazine rack and saw that magazine, she would either want to look at it or act like she didn't even notice it. At her age, she wants someone to look up to, and if she sees a model on or in the magazine, she would want to possibly look like her. So, this is how eating disorders can start. This is the reason why libraries should get rid of any kind of magazines under that category.  These are the reasons why I think our local library should get rid of rated @CAPS1 movies and/or magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. If you agree with me, contact your library and tell them what I have told you today. Let's put a stop to inappropriate content in our libraries @MONTH1."
272	3249	2	3	"There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restricts readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books. This is called censorship. However, what you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library. What would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are too horrific or too adult - like for their own good? This is the question that plagues them every year with new shipments of books. Although yes, that seems terrifying, it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons: The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact that children must take in all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve.  First of the arguments that can be held is the freedom of press. This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today. If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children, then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations. Children @MONTH1 read it, yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author. If so, then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves. It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer.  When it comes to the arguments of what to do on censorship, the freedom of thought pops into most minds. This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think as they will of anything. Just as with the freedom of press, an individual can pick up that book for adults and read it. No matter the age they are. If they are discouraged by it, then by all means let them put it down. However, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in children's novels, let them continue learning.  A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember. This is not scientifically proven, but when you are around children constantly, you notice this. Just as a baby's mind is a sponge, it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre - teen years. When they are allowed to read any book and not sit in front of a television screen all day, they learn more. Now someone can come along and say: ""What if the book is a fantasy?"". It's no different. The storyline is not what teaches them; it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge. An educated man can sometimes get tongue - tied with words, whereas if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit, they are able to use words with great ease. It is not always the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events?  All in all, it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public. There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap. Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someone's ability to learn a new word or grammatical law. If one parent could pull a book off a shelf, then another could do it, and soon you would not have any books. It would be a scary day if that happened. For it would not be something that went well in our history. Since humankind has had writing, we became more intelligent. Taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings. So, keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them. Not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but that the two congressional laws say it should be."
273	3250	2	3	"Some books in libraries offended some people. But other people want to read this book. No one person has the right to say, ""This book offended me, so the libraries should remove it."" If some book offends some person, that doesn't mean all the people will be offended by this book. My opinion is they should not remove this book because some people like to read that book. If someone doesn't like this book and this book offends them, they should not read this book and read what they like. But don't say the book should be removed. I think everyone likes different books. So, libraries should have everything that people like to read. In a library, it's a place for diverse readers. Each person has their own taste, and removing a book just because of one person's opinion takes away the choice for others. We should respect the fact that different people have different preferences when it comes to reading."
274	3251	2	3	If everyone in the world could permanently take a book, movie, music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive, would there be any of those things left for us to enjoy? I personally think that if people could do that, they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be. So, does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanently so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of their own opinion of it.  If anyone could do that, would there ever be uniqueness in people? I don't think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus, it shouldn't be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it. On the other hand, I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that have offensive language and that they would not want their children hearing or reading that. But that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language. What should we do then? You can't just take that person out of the world.  So, I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that just because you think it's offensive and don't like it doesn't mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my article, I want you to think about what's offensive to you @MONTH1 may not be the same for others. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the right of individuals to enjoy the things they like, as long as it doesn't harm others.
275	3252	2	3	The contents of the books in libraries vary in many ways. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. Which means that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel, magazines, music, or movies. A library is supposed to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book, song, or movie.  In the library, in our little town, it splits up the variations of the reading materials, music, and movies. There is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. Also, an adult section for larger novels with topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would not want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.  With the ideas that people are writing about today, we cannot possibly control what comes to their mind. Some of the greatest books that are out probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefer to listen to. But that is what is so great - that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even @CAPS1 that they like. When freedom of what you read is taken away, readers will stop reading. Doesn't the administration of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read, doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also, doesn't that mean the test scores will go down?  In my experience, the topics that I have read about have been more grown - up than my mother would like, but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well - liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc. because that would mean the libraries would lose their essence and eventually, libraries as we know them would be gone. We need to preserve the freedom of reading and the diverse collection in libraries for the betterment of everyone.
276	3253	2	3	If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes, believing that offensive materials have no place in a public space. Others might not think anything of the item and move along, seeing it as a non - issue. I disagree with those who believe the item should be removed. Instead, I firmly believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.  As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steered clear of the 'grown - up' area, understanding that it might contain content not suitable for me. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves, she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees, then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.  However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item, but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see every day, such as newspapers, television programs, billboards, etc. And if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one person's interests.  This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad magazine and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is understandable but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.  If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their music there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.  I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or other media should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need to realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where they are.
277	3254	2	3	Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The British used it in the American colonies during the American Revolution to keep the colonists loyal to the crown, aiming to suppress any anti - monarchy ideas. The Nazis used censorship not just during the Second World War as a brand of propaganda, but also during the pre - war years under Hitler's guidance, shaping public opinion to fit their ideology. Censorship is still in use in the United States today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The Federal Communications Commission tells the American public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the United States and other freedom - loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism.  As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term.  I recently read a book titled 'The River Between', by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal Kenya, and the life he had after his mother's death in the colonial capital of Nairobi. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that Kenyans face in the changing landscape of their country, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort.  All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line? Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the First Amendment, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all American citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, 'Give me liberty, or give me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all.
278	3255	2	3	If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody, don't even bother to look at the material. Even if you might find it initially interesting, but in the end you find out that it is offensive to you, then just take it in the other direction. No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the library because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else; each person is different in their own way. Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional?  Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even affect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others especially have to realize that even if it's written down, it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have taken it the wrong way. Even if you're just making an observation, just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion.  The censorship in libraries is not made just for you; they are made for everybody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inappropriate, then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed. Just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will not find it interesting. If you find any material offensive, then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong. You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it.  I go to the library once in a while, and most of the time I'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive, I just leave it alone and put it down. I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me? I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that it's someone else's opinion and not my own.  If anybody takes it the wrong way, then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters more than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people see it. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of materials in the library and the right of others to have different opinions.
279	3256	2	3	I myself believe that censorship in libraries should not be allowed. If there was to be any censorship, it should be from the parents of a child. If you're not a child, then you don't need to have your access to materials censored. By censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on, I think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens in the world. Just because something isn't censored doesn't mean it should be taken out of context either.  Think of it like this: if you're walking down a street, it's not going to be censored. People will say bad words, show bad habits, and even go as far as seeing death or more. Being a kid who has really never been censored from anything including books, I've learned a lot. But I feel as if I went to a library to get a book and if it's censored or taken off the shelf, then I will be shown a fake world. Once again, if life can't be censored, then we shouldn't censor anything else in libraries.  A censored book, movie or whatever it may be could also determine how much someone could learn from it. People go to libraries to learn hard facts with proof and evidence, and depending on the subject they're looking up, they need access to un - censored materials.  This is some of many reasons I think censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed. Censorship should be chosen by who you are, not by other people. In the end, we may never know what's better until we try, and allowing full access to library materials gives us that chance to learn and grow.
280	3257	2	3	No, because the writer is explaining the way the story really happened. If your kid asks you about a bad word in the book, tell him/her it's not a good word to say. Or you can take the book back and get him/her a new one.  Let's say your kids come home from school and say a curse word and you asked him/her where they learned it from. And they said the teacher said it. You can tell the teacher you don't want your child reading that book.  Cursing is a way of explaining the story better, I guess. It can add realism and authenticity to the narrative. In real life, people do use such language, and books that aim to depict real - life situations might include it. We should understand that the purpose is not to promote bad language but to tell a true - to - life story. So, instead of quickly removing books with such content, we should approach the situation with understanding and use it as an opportunity to teach our children about appropriate and inappropriate language.
281	3258	2	3	Library @CAPS1:                                    @CAPS2 or bad? It is a very rare occasion that I go to the library. I'm a typical guy who loves sports, video games, and hanging out with my friends. When I'm not in school, I try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, such as libraries. Those very rare occasions when I do go to the library, like when I need to get a summer reading book for school, I usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff I see at libraries catches my eye, not because it looks like a @CAPS2 book, but because it's quite shocking to see what they allow to be put on the shelves. On the bookshelves that I have walked by, I have seen romance novels. They aren't as bad as I would have thought. At first, they catch my eye with their titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't inappropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre - teens shouldn't be reading them. So, as long as there is a clear separation between the kids' section and the adult section, then I think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels on the shelves because they are forms of literature. Now, magazines, on the other hand, can be taken either way. Gossip magazines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines is that a lot of the writing is people's opinions, and they could be talking in a very negative way about some people or some things. I think it's up to the library to make a decision on that. But if someone complains about it, I think the library should be kind enough to take it off the shelf. There are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes. I feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine, they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library, and their son asked them why that magazine had a half - naked lady on it. I just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug their parents all day about what they saw at the library. Music and movies are not that hard to control from getting into the wrong hands. Nowadays, @CAPS3 cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory. So, I feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way; they have ratings. If the librarian sees a @NUM1 - year - old kid trying to check out a rated @CAPS4 movie, then she should be fired because there is clearly no reason why she would do that. Excuses can't come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person, you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now, @CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all. Libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like having strippers in school; it is just not ethical. In conclusion, I feel that censorship in libraries is a @CAPS2 thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in areas that they shouldn't be, then everything should be fine.
282	3259	2	3	I don't see any reason why to take books off the shelves. If someone doesn't like a book, then they simply don't have to read it. Books are meant to entertain or inform people. There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know about different perspectives and historical contexts. Libraries are out to make money, that's all. Let them make money; they can sell whatever they want. If I had a library, I would sell just about anything I could. People will watch, listen, and read anything. So, why not sell it or rent it out? It's an honest way of making money. By providing a wide range of materials, libraries can meet the diverse interests of their patrons and contribute to a more informed and well - rounded society.
283	3260	2	3	'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty - bitty waist and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' This @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now, look closely at both lyrics, and you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi, while the other says that love can be seen everywhere and anywhere. To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well, it's not; banning books, music, etc. is just like censoring someone's imagination and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read and even think. Taking away movies and books is to not allow people to learn from their past. Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example. Though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remember the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been censored or removed, I personally would have never learned about the hard times of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a person's soul and emotions. A book, magazine, movie, etc. are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day, a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and I rushed through my iPod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics, and he eventually put the idea of suicide away. While yes, there are songs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We still see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then, we can say that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get censored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more; it would be craved because it is an unreachable thing. In a free society, we should embrace the diversity of creative expression and use it as a tool for growth and understanding.
284	3261	2	3	The world today in the @LOCATION1 is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on. I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to whatever it @MONTH1 be that is considered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be @NUM1 years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing as it helps protect younger audiences from potentially inappropriate content. Parents should, also, definitely be the ones to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children, for the most part, don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before, that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only. These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in, and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you. There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people are raised and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials. Therefore, these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent. If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion. In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is @LOCATION2, let's not be overly strict about things. We should strike a balance between protecting the vulnerable and respecting the rights of individuals to access a wide range of information and creative works.
285	3262	2	3	How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen something that you think no other kid should see? I'm going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive, then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries? After all, it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace. Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happens and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn about the real world and the consequences of using such language? The books that children read vary. The younger kids won't know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a serious part to the story or a tragic moment in the characters' life. Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters say a bad word and what happens to him if he says it. Authors usually vary their vocabulary in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the @DATE1's, why would they try and clean up the grammar that was spoken from that time? That would try and change what the reader might think about that time. Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear something offensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in so that children can have access to a full and unfiltered view of the world through literature, which is essential for their intellectual and emotional development.
286	3263	2	3	I believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned from their children, but not from the public. Everyone has their own beliefs in what he or she reads, writes, or even watches, so the library is perfect the way it is. We cannot throw out books we find offensive because of our beliefs, as somebody else might want to come along and read about a certain religion or a certain topic. If we threw out all the books and made a library with only the books we wanted, we'd be in a lot of debt because then we'd have to build libraries for everyone instead of one that allows us all to enjoy our favorite books all at the same place. So, if we have a problem with a book or movie from the library, we should just keep our children away from that item and inform them on why they should not be subjected to that item. In the end, respecting the diversity of reading materials in libraries ensures that everyone has access to the knowledge and entertainment they desire, while also allowing parents to guide their children's reading choices.
287	3264	2	3	A very wise man in my life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' My father, [Father's Name], while growing up had poor influences all around him. He went to a run - down school, lived in a crime - torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a father, had no mother around to help him, and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As he grew up, there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. He had no example of how to behave, yet he stayed away from alcohol, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as'minor' as pornography. As I have been growing up with my father as a hard - working individual and having my mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, my parents moved out of the old crime - ridden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdemeanors. My father told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, foul language was unheard of in songs and music but now - a - days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate, I'm scared of the thought of what your kids are going to see, son.' He had a valid point. In our current days, the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talks about killing law enforcement officers. What has the world come to when a child of age eight can walk into a public library and check - out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf, that we should just remove the book from the shelf and not have the book there at all. Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel threatened or endangered. Well, what if my father, as a parent, feels threatened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by today's society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resources should be controlled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent should not have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inappropriate topic while in public but should know that that is not the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest assured that their child is safe from the filth of immoral things. In conclusion, taking action to remove inappropriate materials from public libraries is essential to protect the well - being of children and maintain the integrity of these public spaces.
288	3265	2	3	When I was in seventh grade, I had a mission to read every [Author's Name] book I could get my hands on. Some of the material in her books proved to be a little too racy for most middle - schoolers, and some parents had apparently deemed it inappropriate, and our school librarian had made the decision not to carry it in the school's library. I was devastated. There would be no way my mother would agree to buy me all twenty - some odd books that [Author's Name] had written, and I didn't have enough money from my meager allowance and various lemonade stands to purchase them myself. Back then, this censorship which banned my favorite books from ever showing their covers in our school's library, bothered me immensely. I couldn't understand why some people's parents might view some of the subject matter in her books as too mature for our age group. However, I am having a change of heart. Now I can understand why our school's library might not be so fond of carrying books with racy aspects to them. That is why I believe that in school libraries, some books should be censored or marked mature. In public libraries though, these books should not be censored. Books need to be censored in school libraries because some children might be too immature to handle the subject matter within the book's pages. Most parents want their children to stay as innocent as possible for as long as possible, and I can respect this idea. Having advanced books would also make the school look bad as not all parents would be on board with the idea, and some would complain about their children reading something which they didn't intend them to find out about for many years to come. Not all censorship has to do with sex. Another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type. The real - time war story which depicts the horrors of fighting for one's country and juxtaposes it with the thought that war is valiant and something to be applauded in the people back home. Some of these stories can get very graphic as to convey the point that war is not all fine and dandy and all it seems cracked up to be. These type of stories are important for our culture to prevent any misconceptions we might have or try to prevent them from a young age by shocking the reader. War should not be perceived as something fun and exciting, and young students should know that so when they reach the age of signing up for the military, they don't go into it misguided. In these instances, these violent stories are important for our youth to see, and I think that they should not be censored in the library. One might raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence. I am not advocating that books with unnecessary violence be put on the shelves. I believe that the books with violence which helps to convey an important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries. Public libraries are a far different story. They have different sections for children's literature and adult literature. In school libraries, the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers. While in the public library, it is the exact opposite (unless in the case of a children's public library). Most public libraries carry mostly adult books and a small section of children's books. In this type of setting, it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section, marked mature. The subject matter doesn't really matter, but the point of public libraries is to educate our citizens, and if what they want to read is violent or sexually explicit, then so be it, as long as they are reading at all and using the government - funded resources provided for them. If the library was privately owned, then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to. In conclusion, the different natures of school and public libraries call for different approaches to censorship. School libraries should protect the innocence of young readers, while public libraries should offer a wide range of materials to meet the diverse needs of the general public.
289	3266	2	3	In my opinion, they should not censor books. They should be read the way that the author intended for them to be read. I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they can be played on the radio and in the theaters. The books that are controversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. They were written with this language because that's the way people talked back then. These books are classics and should not be changed. In the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then, and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. It should not be changed. It is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. When an artist writes a song, they know that it won't be able to be played on the radio if it has bad or graphic language. I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so it can be played on the radio for all to hear. The song 'F**k You' by CeeLo Green, they replaced the f - word with 'Forget'. When he wrote this song, he knew that it wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and it is still a good song. Movies are about the same as songs. They can't show a movie in theaters if it is too graphic. They might take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once it is sold in stores. I understand and respect everyone's opinion on this matter. I am just voicing mine. If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made it so. In conclusion, while censorship has its place in the realms of songs and movies for public broadcast, books should remain in their original form to preserve the author's intended message.
290	3267	2	3	Censorship of books and other media is a complex issue. The quote 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson. She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we cannot take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we cannot take certain books off the shelves in our library. We cannot take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors' freedom of the press. Who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship? These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong. Taking certain books off shelves would be against our constitution. The First Amendment gives all American citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they might include a few controversial things, we are violating their natural right. Which leads me to my next argument: if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge? So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? One person might think something is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censor books, magazines, or music, there would be an uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is too far? This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things, what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our whole lives would become one big judgement. Self - expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inappropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward. There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary and try to understand where others are coming from. If we can do that, our world would be a much better place. In conclusion, while the impulse to censor may come from good intentions, it is crucial to uphold the principles of freedom of the press and respect the diversity of opinions to foster a more inclusive and progressive society.
291	3268	2	3	Books are valuable sources of knowledge and entertainment, and along with magazines, music, movies, etc., they serve a common purpose. At first, I thought the only thing to do was to read them well. Even though books, magazines, and some movies might contain content that offends some people, it doesn't mean they should be removed from the shelves. I firmly believe they should stay. If someone like you wrote it, someone like you is likely to be more eager to read it. Sometimes, books and magazines are inappropriate and might offend people, but that's no reason to take them away completely. People sometimes need to read things they're not entirely comfortable with. Reading about unfamiliar things can help us learn to avoid bad behaviors. It can also prevent some kids from smoking and doing drugs if they learn from the experiences described. Books and magazines that offend people are just presenting what some don't want to hear. Drugs and sexual content are always around our children, whether in real - life or media. Putting a book about drugs in libraries won't make kids try drugs. It's about self - control; some people have it, and some don't. Reading such books can actually prevent problems. So, libraries should keep the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see them in local libraries, they don't have to pick them up. These materials help us become stronger and keep our community clean. They're important for the community to read to avoid bad habits. That's why books that offend some people shouldn't be removed from libraries. Libraries can just move offensive books and magazines to another section. This way, people can avoid such content. Libraries should maintain the current status of keeping books, magazines, and movies on the shelves.
292	3269	2	3	Typically, when you enter a library, you'll find books, magazines, movies, and CDs everywhere. The majority of the items in the library are suitable for children, but there are also materials intended for adults and teenagers. Many individuals struggle with the fact that some library items are offensive to religion, contain offensive language, or feature adult - oriented content. In our country, we have the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion, which allow us to make choices in situations like this. It's true that there are books that can be very offensive to different types of people and religions. Have you ever come across a movie that was educational yet offensive? In my opinion, people should have the right to censor, to a certain extent, what the library provides for their students or children. If a book, magazine, or any other item is offensive to someone, they should be able to decide whether their student or child can access it. However, people shouldn't abuse this censorship privilege. I believe our generation is different from past ones because many of the things we encounter are likely to be offensive to a particular religion or type of person. This, in a way, is affecting the censorship efforts of those who choose to participate. I think a person or an authority figure should be able to request a book to be taken off the shelf, but only if the library approves the request. People have the right to make choices, but taking away others' opportunities to read a book or check out a movie is an over - step of the censorship privilege. When a person finds an item offensive, they should sign a paper stating why they think it should be removed and the group of people they believe it's offensive to. In this way, only that specific item should be restricted from that particular group. All in all, I believe library censorship is a great idea considering all the negative content in books, movies, and CDs. People have the right to change things if they think they're wrong. They should seize the opportunity to make things better when they can. Do you think library censorship is a good idea? I do, as it gives people the chance to improve their situation if they find something offensive.
293	3270	2	3	I think that censorship should not be a major concern in libraries because books, magazines, music, and movies are liked by different people around the world. If you don't like the content of some materials, simply don't read, watch, or listen to them. People have diverse tastes. For example, some people like rap music, while others prefer rock music. Those who like rock might dislike rap due to the language used in rap songs. This is why people choose different types of music and avoid what they find offensive. I personally like rock and metal music because rap can be a bit offensive. I've had family members tell me I shouldn't listen to such music because of the language. Some people say reading is a matter of preference. But imagine sitting in a doctor's office and wanting to read a magazine lying around. If you start going through it and find something offensive, you can either keep flipping the pages or put it down. You need to remember that there are others who enjoy or are interested in what you find offensive. The best thing to do is put it down and realize it's not directed at you. Magazines can have all sorts of hidden content. Sometimes, looking at the cover can give you an idea of what's inside and help you decide whether to read it. Movies are always enjoyable, regardless of the occasion. Some people like action, comedy, romance, or drama movies. Some might dislike action movies because of the violence, and others might not like comedy due to the rude humor. There are many types of movies, and it's not the producers' fault that we don't like them. People make different movies because everyone has different preferences. If you're offended by a movie's content, you can read about it before watching. In conclusion, censorship should not matter in libraries because these materials are loved by different people everywhere.
294	3271	2	3	Censorship of books is a complex topic. Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, because there are certain things that should not be publicly accessible. Personally, I think censoring certain materials is okay. There are books that should not be read, music that contains swearing, drug - related talk, or other inappropriate content, movies rated 'R' or 'PG - 13' with blood, nudity, etc., and various types of magazines such as adult, children's, cooking, cleaning, pet - related, and outdoor - themed ones. However, I can't understand how some people find books offensive, especially those about history or personal experiences. For example, if a colored kid reads a book about 'African slavery' and gets offended, saying 'You owe me because my ancestors were slaves', that's a misunderstanding. I've had similar experiences where I either got offended and angry or just threw the book away. I love reading, but some things are just not meant to be read. As for me, I get offended by some books, movies, and music. I don't read magazines, so I can't be offended by them. But when I read books like 'The Twilight Saga' and then watch the movies, I take it offensively because the movies don't match the books or the direction is off. When it comes to books, I love reading, but I can get very emotional. If a character does something I don't like or a character dies and reminds me of a friend or teacher, I either cry or stop reading. Music is another area where I have strong opinions. I used to love rap, but now it's become terrible. Rappers often talk about killing, drugs, or sex. There are many other music genres like pop, rock, jazz, blues, punk, country, etc. I could talk about music all day. Some people are censoring TV shows like 'SpongeBob SquarePants'. There's nothing wrong with that show; some adults think it's bad, but they're wrong. I've watched it since I was five, and there's never been anything inappropriate. People who are censoring things should take the time to understand before making decisions. We should be more rational about censorship.
295	3272	2	3	Libraries are filled with tons of books, CDs, movies, and magazines, catering to people with different interests. While most of the materials are appropriate, some might be offensive to certain individuals. Let me share my thoughts. Most people have their own preferences. There are dedicated sections in libraries for kids, teens, and adults. There may be some content that people find offensive, but that doesn't mean these items should be removed from the shelves. People just need to make a choice. If something is offensive, they simply don't have to pick it up. It's as simple as that. These library products are a source of knowledge and entertainment for many. By keeping them on the shelves, libraries offer a wide range of options. People should respect the diversity of materials and use their discretion. Censoring too much would limit the opportunities for others to explore different ideas. So, in conclusion, libraries should maintain the current system of having various items on display, and people should exercise their right to choose what they want to engage with.
296	3273	2	3	I for one have a deep - seated love for books, movies, music, etc., and I firmly believe they should remain without censoring. Sheltering the young is not a wise approach because they naturally become curious about things. Sometimes, they won't tell us about their curiosity; instead, they'll find out for themselves. Most media and books have uncensored elements for various reasons, and I think the current state is working well. Yes, there are some youth who take certain things too seriously, but that's mainly because the parents aren't there to offer explanations. I'm not suggesting that we go and show a four - year - old a rated '@CAPS1' movie, but we should lighten up on some restrictions. Music is omnipresent; it's truly difficult to shelter your kid from it. You should keep an eye on what they're listening to, but they're going to hear it sooner or later. It's better for them to hear it around you rather than someone else who might give them the wrong advice. Some parents complain a great deal about this subject because they don't want to always be present to explain everything. But then, if they can't take on that responsibility, why have a child in the first place? Books aren't so different. If a book has content that parents don't want their children to read, they can take it away. However, most books with such content don't have pictures, so kids would have to imagine it. If they don't understand what's being talked about, they won't be able to conjure up anything bad. I'm not going to be a careless parent, but I firmly believe that sheltering kids from the real world, media, and books is a bad and unwise idea. Kids will learn about curse words, drinking, and drugs someday. It's up to the parents to be there and teach the kids right from wrong when they have questions about what they've heard, watched, or read. People worry too much about censoring and ensuring everything is clean, but media and books have never been completely clean. Some people are just being lazy and don't want to be there for their child @PERCENT1. When I was young, my parents didn't shelter me or restrict my reading choices, and I turned out fine. I don't drink or do drugs because my parents were there to answer my questions about things I didn't understand in books or the media. It's not the media or literature that's the problem; it's the parents. If they can't be there to explain, then they shouldn't have become parents. As for magazines, if a parent is really concerned about certain ones around their children, they can simply prevent them from buying them. It's their choice. Don't you want your kid to grow up and live their own life as an adult? Then don't shelter them from everything. Let them find out about things when they ask questions. If they read something in a book and don't understand it, you can either tell them whether it's right or wrong or let them find out the hard way. That's your decision. If they see something on @CAPS2, explain it to them instead of freaking out and blocking them from knowing what's in the real world. It's your choice, but if you shelter them for too long, they'll never have a fulfilling life. Sheltering might not seem so bad now, but wait until they grow older and start their lives. They won't know what to do or how to communicate properly. I've witnessed firsthand how sheltering kids from media and books can have a negative impact on their lives. Censoring everything isn't beneficial. These days, media and books are the main ways to learn about real life. Not censoring everything will help people understand what the world needs to improve. So, don't censor everything and let the next generation learn from the mistakes of the previous one.
297	3274	2	3	In our modern world, there's a remarkable place where you can find almost anything you desire all in one building. People call these places libraries. Libraries house nearly every book ever written and generously offer them to the public free of charge. If you can't find what you're looking for in a book, they also provide a wealth of other resources, including movies, music, magazines, and access to the internet. I'm not here to advocate for banning any materials that some might find offensive because, let's face it, everything is offensive to someone. In today's world, there are always people who claim to be offended just to make a point or gain attention, even if they don't truly care about the subject at hand. The internet in libraries can take you to a vast array of content. Yes, libraries do have blocks on the internet to restrict access to extremely offensive websites, but unfortunately, some people have learned how to bypass these blocks. Libraries are well - organized, with children's materials located in one area, teenage materials in another spot, and adult materials in a separate room. As a young child, I loved going to libraries. I had a great time and spent hours reading. One thing I never did was venture into the adult room, and I think many other kids feel the same way. In fact, I've never once seen a child in the adult section of a library. Movies and music in libraries have ratings. If the rating is above what a child should be exposed to, the child can't check out the movie or music without a parent's signature. This system ensures that kids can't access inappropriate or offensive materials without parental approval. Our libraries are set up in a perfect way, and I firmly believe we shouldn't try to change them. Movies and music have ratings, and kids are restricted from checking out offensive materials. The materials are organized by age group, and kids generally stay within the area that interests them. Last but not least, if we were to remove all the so - called offensive materials from libraries, our communities would no longer have these valuable institutions.
298	3275	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern. It has become increasingly obvious to me that we face a significant problem in our media today. The way information is accessed and how individuals seek it has evolved at an astonishing rate and continues to change rapidly. With the vast amount of technology and new information available, it's extremely challenging to implement effective censorship. Two weeks ago, I took my @NUM1 - year - old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book. As soon as the automatic doors of the library opened, she rushed straight to the movie section. I couldn't help but laugh because I knew that was the real reason she wanted to go to the library. When I asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over without hesitation and said, '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'. 'I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6,' I thought to myself. Then I realized how easily a child can access adult - oriented information. I agree with @PERSON1 to some extent. I believe that if we start completely removing certain information, we'll end up being ignorant. However, when we expose our children, who are the future of the world, to adult information, they can be greatly affected. For example, think about @CAPS9 teens and violent video games or explicit magazines. My niece can check out any book in the library, including @CAPS10 @CAPS11's famous book titled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13', which means'my struggle' in German. My @NUM1 - year - old niece reads quite well and is very impressionable, just like many young children. Public media outlets, including public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14, need to be more strictly monitored. I believe books should be censored based on their content, similar to how movies are rated. This way, the distributors are held responsible, and consumers are more aware of the content and its potential impact. By taking these steps, we can better protect our children from inappropriate information while still allowing access to valuable knowledge.
299	3276	2	3	That saying Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I strongly disagree with that statement. I firmly believe it is the government's responsibility to decide if certain items should be removed from libraries, and we need legitimate reasons to take books off the shelves. Some people advocate for removing books that teach kids about our history, but they don't have the right to deprive children of this knowledge. In the statement Katherine made, she is essentially supporting this wrong idea of taking away our kids' right to learn US history. Our children have every right to learn about our nation's past, and if we take that away, we have no idea what our future generation will be like. Some kids might not even know who @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is or how we came to this continent. Parents also object to their children reading books with foul language or nudity. I understand what these parents are trying to do; they're trying to protect their children. However, the fact is that people will encounter these things in life. If kids aren't introduced to these aspects at a younger age, they'll be at a loss when they grow older. Some kids who have this right taken away won't know how to handle such situations. Moreover, the foul language in these books can add authenticity and bring the stories to life. We don't want the upcoming generations to be oblivious to the real world. When I was in fifth grade, I was an avid reader. I loved adventure books like 'The Boxcar Children'. One time, I went to the library and picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian refused to let me check it out because there were some inappropriate texts in it. That really dampened my enthusiasm for reading, and I no longer wanted to go to the library and check out books on my own. So, adults who want to remove these books from the shelves might be hindering our generation's learning. If we don't learn, the next generation won't be interested in reading or learning either. These are just a few reasons why we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are many other people with valid reasons as well. If you want to take this right away from us, be prepared for an argument because we'll fight for it. So, if you adults want to take a book off the shelf, you'd better have very good and legitimate reasons.
300	3277	2	3	Censorship is a complex and tricky concept. It's a term that can lead to music being banned from stores, books being removed from shelves, and movies being prohibited from theaters. Katherine Paterson, a well - known author, once said that if all potentially offensive reading or listening materials were removed, there would be nothing left. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. I firmly believe that offensive material should not be removed for the following reasons: it suppresses the author's creative expression, if we keep removing, there will be no materials left on the shelves, and there's no clear - cut definition of what is or isn't offensive. I understand that there are many people who oppose my view. I truly empathize with their concerns. Some audiences believe that removing offensive material is beneficial as it shields the ears and minds of those who can't handle the language or context. Others think that sensitive audiences won't be comfortable with certain texts. Additionally, many people are worried that exposing young children to violent, risky, or materials with dangerous habits will encourage similar behavior in them. While these are all valid opinions, they aren't sufficient reasons to automatically remove such materials from the shelves. Contrary to what others think, one reason offensive material should stay on the shelves is that if it's removed, the thoughts and feelings of the writer will be suppressed. Take the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' for example. It was banned for a long time. Harper @CAPS3's book might contain some slurs that we find offensive today, but that was the way people spoke during that era. Who are we to judge the people of the @DATE1 and @DATE2 for their choice of words? By banning 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' for that period, generations were deprived of the powerful and profound message of the book, which is that you can't punish the innocent. The same principle applies to other @CAPS6 books. This is one of the key reasons I believe such books should remain on the shelves. Next, works of literature and music should stay on the shelves because, as Katherine Paterson said, if everyone removes a book, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is very true. Many books have made it onto the banned book list, such as 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2', '@CAPS9 in the @CAPS10', '@PERSON2', etc. We have no idea what book will be removed next. Once all literature is gone, the next target will likely be music. Look at the singer/songwriter @PERSON3. His music was very sexually themed. In the @DATE3, when people bought his records, they had to be covered or placed in brown paper bags. This can be seen as a form of censorship, and it's just one step away from an outright ban. His record company refused to produce his music under his name because of the scandalous lyrics, which led him to change his name to an unpronounceable symbol. What will be the next thing to be restricted? Finally, my last reason for not removing offensive material is that it's impossible to determine what is offensive. A novel or song might be appealing to @NUM1 people, but should it be removed from record stores or libraries because of one person's opinion? I don't think so. There are many words and concepts that weren't socially accepted in the past but have become common and acceptable over time. If we give this so - called 'offensive material' time, it may lose its offensive nature in the future. For all these reasons, I firmly oppose removing anything from the shelves just because someone finds it unacceptable
301	3278	2	3	Everyone is different and unique in the world, with their own distinct personalities, backgrounds, and experiences, and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the argument of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive, others may not. The censorship that I am discussing is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone. The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books, then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored, there will be fewer books for people to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored, some people may never even get a chance to see those books, and they won't be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed, and if they are censored, that chance is gone. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book, then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book because they don't like it. Another person may enjoy that book, and many others may like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want, and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to. The last reason is parents can limit what their children read. If the parents don't want their children reading something, then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book because it is inappropriate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children, and it makes life simpler. Also, it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children, and adults can worry about themselves. The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Someone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book, so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reasons why this is true. First, the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public. Also, people have the right to choose what they want. Finally, parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a book's chance to be loved by censoring it. In a free - thinking society, the open availability of books in libraries is essential for the growth and exploration of knowledge.
302	3279	2	3	Some people ask, 'Should books be censored from libraries?' There are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books. I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on what the subject matter of those things are about. It's also the parent's job to monitor what their kids read, listen to, or watch. There's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the library's job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job. Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. What one person thinks is bad, another may not. It goes the other way, too: what one person thinks is good, another may think is bad. On the subject of movies, there are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a PG - 13 movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least 13. I thought it was ridiculous because it was only a PG - 13 movie, and it was harmless. With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't necessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it. In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on what the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. What one parent thinks is bad, another may not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magazines shouldn't be censored without careful consideration. Parents can just decide what they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to, and libraries can implement reasonable access controls rather than outright censorship.
303	3280	2	3	Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In today's world, it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in their life time. Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or two. People may interpret it different than others. Therefore, I personally don't think they should take articles out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornography, then they should definitely take it out. There are various perspectives on what is offensive. A book with complex and controversial ideas might be seen as offensive by some, but it could also offer valuable insights and stimulate critical thinking. Similarly, music with non - traditional lyrics may be disliked by some, but it could be a form of self - expression for others. My conclusion is that you can't please everybody. I think that you shouldn't take things out of the library that can help a student learn. Libraries should be a place where diverse materials are available, and people can make their own choices about what to engage with, as long as it doesn't cross the line into truly harmful or pornographic content.
304	3281	2	3	At a local library, you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style, and of different stories. Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same; we all have different likes and interests. Some people may find certain books disturbing and inappropriate, thinking that the book shouldn't be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people. What one person finds disturbing and gross, another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same, so not all books are going to be eye - catching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inappropriate, yet another finds it interesting and suggests that book to their friends, is that one who disagrees upon the reading material as unacceptable to their community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it? Everyone should be given the same opportunity to read the book that another may find inappropriate. People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wander over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those images. A mother doesn't want her child to be able to pick up a porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazines in adult stores where children won't be able to view them. Now, some books may have a naked picture in the text, but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well - educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that may have nude photos should be allowed; they educate the community and save lives. Although not one person's voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, and we all should be heard. Books are in the same way; they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitement, sorrow, and anger. We all have different hungers for different reading, music, and fashion. In this world today, in our society, and in our community, there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who don't share the same views, who look upon life in a different way, whose voices aren't all the same. The book has a curse word in the text; that doesn't mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has ever read in their life. Everyone has different views, likes, interests, wants, and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger for reading material. We should all be given the opportunity to read or not read what another person finds inappropriate. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unacceptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implied with the pursuit to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many inappropriate contexts are included. Let everyone read as they please, and let everyone be happy in what they read. In a well - functioning library system, a balance can be struck between protecting the young and allowing for the free flow of diverse knowledge.
305	3282	2	3	Dear [Recipient's Name]: I am [Your Name], and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries. And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation. There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate. Many people have different opinions than other people. Everyone has a different point of view and sees things differently, especially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids. I believe if a child comes home with a book, movie, etc., and their parent does not approve, the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate. The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it. And if she finds it not appropriate, then she has the right to take it off the shelf. If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not appropriate and the librarian believes it is alright, then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library. Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says it's inappropriate, the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section and maybe put it in an older kid area. I have actually had an experience with this. At my old school, adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate. When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books. The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library. So she had a great idea. She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk. If you wanted one of those books, you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book. It was a really good idea because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them, you weren't tempted to get one and wouldn't even see them. And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all. Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people's books, movies, etc., go talk to them about why they are over there and tell them that that's not their age - level material. Try to direct them over to their age - level area and try to find them a book, movie, etc. they may be interested in. I believe that everyone has different opinions, but just because one person complains, it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for
306	3283	2	3	"I think that the libraries in general shouldn't take the music, movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what kind of environment they have at home, and they just want to get away and relax themselves at the library while reading. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the shelves just for some random reason because people truly love going to the library. And if they don't have those things, then what's the point of going there? My other reason why they shouldn't take those things away is that they will not make a profit. When the people go to the library and they don't see those things, they are going to wonder what happened. I think that it shouldn't be the children's fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library's fault that they made them take the books off the shelves. I also think that when the children go to the library, they are going to ask their parent or someone, ""Where are the books because they want to read and also where are the books so they can check them out?"" But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out. I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason, and that reason is that people and children would go, like on a weekend, to read if they don't have any of those things at home. My stance is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it's going to be a big commotion. So, by removing all of that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling lonely and they want to go to the library and read. But my whole point about it is that who came up with no books, music, or magazines on the shelves? But I also think that if they did that in the real world, then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people. I think that they should not do that because the people love to read, listen to music, and so on. I also think that they should not do that because people love going there to relieve some stress that they might have and they just want to go there. I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love their jobs too much not to. One of the things that I like is that when I go to the library, it is nice and quiet, and we can listen to our iPod or our @NUM1 player, something like that. Some people just love to go so that they can see their friends and communicate with them or get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like their jobs and so on. In conclusion, libraries should keep their diverse collection to serve the needs and interests of all visitors."
307	3284	2	3	Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes come across a swear word? Does it bother you to hear such words with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you simply cannot avoid the harsh language that permeates today's society. Have you ever walked into your library, started reading a book, but then decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries contain offensive language. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases, the reader may be offended. In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, simply put it back on the shelf. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it. Some material may be inappropriate for younger readers. The maturity level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship. For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The @CAPS1' for its use of alcohol and drugs. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining. Should this movie be taken off the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs? These words and actions we try to censor are not going away. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you may be. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one. In conclusion, while offensive language exists, it's best to let readers make their own choices rather than trying to censor everything.
308	3285	2	3	I think that if certain materials are offensive, they should be taken off the shelf, depending on the nature of the offense. If they are offensive due to racism or being prejudiced, I think they shouldn't be on the shelves. Also, if it is offensive to women or men, then it should be removed from the shelves. People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it. I think that if it is offensive to different races, then yes, it should be taken off the shelves. I think this because children can read this and then they might believe that it is right to be racist against other races. I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others. Also, they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others. People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others. It could also cause problems for the libraries. This would happen because people may not want to come back due to the fact that they have offensive material. Then, with people not wanting to be there, the libraries won't have enough patronage, and they will have to close. I also believe that if the material is offensive to women/men, then it should be taken off the shelf. The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive because a lot of people look at them like they are trash. It makes a bad impression on some people. It's rude for it to be there. It puts not very good thoughts in some people's heads. I believe that if material being read or listened to is offensive, then it should be taken off the shelf. It can cause many problems with others. It could cause us to lose libraries if others choose not to go anymore. Things should not be left around if they are offensive in any way. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from library shelves is necessary to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.
309	3286	2	3	There are people out there that think some things should be taken off the shelves or not even made. But that's their decision, and not everyone should listen to it or just try to implement it. I think things that are offensive should and shouldn't be taken off. They should because it might offend someone, and it shouldn't because then people can read or see it or even listen to it if it's music and then know more about it, and then they might not do the same things. So people do have a choice on what should be banned or not, but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too. They might not want their kids to read it, but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also. I think they shouldn't be taken off because no matter what they do or what they say, stuff will still be out there in the world that people think are offensive, and you just can't stop all of it. I listen to a lot of music when I drive to school, and most of it is rap music. Yes, most of it is offensive to girls and stuff, but that's just music; it doesn't mean it's true or anything. People have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it. If they think it is offensive to them or to anyone else or just don't like it, they have the right to just avoid it and not look at it. People want to just change everything and make sure things are perfect and nothing bad is in the world. But no matter what you try to do, something bad will be out there waiting for you. You just got to know how to avoid it. Avoiding things that you don't like would be a lot easier than just taking all the time you have to try to get something banned off of a shelf. You should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what it's all about. When I read or listen to something that's offensive and I don't like it, I will just turn it off or not read it anymore. Not try to get it banned because that takes too much time. People should just not worry about what is being said or written and try to get it banned because another book will be out again, and it will be the same. So as you can see, I think the material that is written should just stay as it is, and people can have their choice on if they want to read it or not. If they do and they think it's offensive, then that's their fault for reading it when they know it's gonna offend them. And for the people who don't read it, they are doing it because they know it will offend them. So not reading something that you don't like will be better in the end because then nothing will be banned, and maybe nothing else will be made in the process of it being banned. So nothing should be banned, and just keep it, and everything will still be the same. We might not want our kids to read something bad, but they will one day, so why not just get it done and over with in the beginning. In conclusion, allowing offensive material to remain accessible gives individuals the freedom to make their own choices and learn to deal with the real world.
310	3287	2	3	Censorship in libraries could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kids' books. In the adult section, they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that may be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended. Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader, so I have been to libraries many times, but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there. For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience. That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best - film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4, but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it. In conclusion, creating an alternative section in libraries for offensive material is a practical solution that preserves literature while respecting different sensibilities.
311	3288	2	3	There are thousands of libraries throughout the world. All of which are filled with numerous books, magazines, music, movies, etc. for people of all ages to obtain. Some people think that materials in a library should be censored while others think everything should be allowed to be there. I do not think materials at a library should be removed, or censored, because the available materials would decrease significantly, people should have the freedom to choose what to look at, and the diverse material would greatly help with various types of research.   Materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease. Everyone has different opinions on what they think is appropriate or not. If one person were to decide a book was inappropriate and take it off the shelf, another person would have the right to take another book that they thought was inappropriate off the shelf as well. However, since everyone has different beliefs on what is appropriate and what is not, the books would rapidly decrease. The same would apply to the other items at the libraries such as magazines, movies, etc.   Another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library. A fifty - year - old man would not have the same interests as a thirteen - year - old girl, so if some materials were removed, there would not be as much of a variety to choose from. If there is a little variety to choose from due to materials being censored, the amount of people using the library would decrease causing the library to eventually get shut down from the lack of people using it.   Lastly, materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research. A child from high school could go to the library to look for a book to help research things for a report in one of their classes, or an elder woman could go to the library in search of a cookbook to research something new to make for her next home - cooked meal. Both people would need a material from the library to help them with their research, but if some materials at the library were removed, they might not be able to find something to help them.   Materials at a library should not be censored because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research. Some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed, but I strongly disagree. There are many different materials in the libraries around the world today for people of all ages to come in contact with, and that is the way it should stay, as it ensures a rich and diverse experience for all library users.
312	3289	2	3	In my opinion, I don't really think certain items should be removed from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion, I never remove anything from a library because I know there are a lot of people with many interests. At the same time, I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library because they might not be appropriate for children. However, if we removed certain items from the library, people would get mad.  I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can also make sure that no under - age kid can go to an adult area. For example, we can set up barriers or have staff monitor the areas. If we don't remove anything from the library, we would have a lot of people coming. On the other hand, if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens, smaller amounts of people will come.  In my personal opinion, no item should be removed from the library because many people have many interests in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library, then we would lose a certain amount of people. That's why we should not remove anything from the library to prevent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said, many people have many interests in many things and they deserve to enjoy them in the library. By keeping the library diverse, we can ensure that it remains a place where everyone can find something they love.
313	3290	2	3	Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they may even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offensive language and not - so - well - presented pictures. They may be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.  Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, etc. need to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach. A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults.  On a stormy day, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. He is only six about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosaurs, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. He was very into reading. He read to our mom every night before he would go to bed. We were walking down the street when a bolt of lightning struck through the trees. 'Ekkkk!' said my brother as he ran around me. We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sorta ignore her and go on about our business picking our books for my brother. My brother and I walk up stairs to the children's section. My brother is looking around and he says 'hey kayla, what is this' and he picks up a naughty magazine. I rush over to snatch it out of his hands and he gets scared. He asks 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond. I tell him to pick a book and come on. He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off. It was completely dark. 'Stay calm.' a man says. The back - up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area. We sit there for twenty minutes and the lights are back on. Everything is normal again and we go to check out. We get up to the front and I turn in the bad magazine that my brother had found. The lady asks why I was bringing it to her and I had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the children's section. She said 'oh my!' We then check out the book, and as we leave the library, I hope that the staff will take better care to ensure inappropriate items are kept away from the children's area.
314	3291	2	3	Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion, they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefore, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not through the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.  Throughout history, mankind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happened throughout history. With those experiences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensive'. If you were to try and delete these pieces, one, you would be destroying a big part of history, and two, there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.  The second reason is that people have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.  The third reason is that people will experience all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restaurant, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion, that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authenticity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.  In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that, if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still experience 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and people will have to accept that fact. That is why we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, as it allows us to have a more complete understanding of the world and prepares us for real - life experiences.
315	3292	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored.  An idea that is offensive to one person may not be offensive to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro - life on the controversial issue of abortion may believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions. The Bible may be offensive to someone of a non - Christian religion, and because of that the Bible would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, may not be to another.  If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors may say forget it and not even write anymore. It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored.  If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me may find some of the material they read - even in school - to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored.  A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, may not be
316	3293	2	3	Recently, the growing issue of censorship in libraries has truly caught my attention. This is extremely unfortunate. People inherently have a right to unmolested knowledge, and censoring libraries is a direct and blatant violation of that right. Libraries are fundamentally meant to be a place of learning, and they should undoubtedly be kept that way.  History is filled with moments that are both glorious and inglorious. We aren't always proud of what we do or what happens, but those events remain, regardless of whether or not we choose to acknowledge them. To think that turning a blind eye to the less - than - clean aspects will make them go away is not only unrealistic but also completely ignorant of facts.  I realize that there are some things children should not see or hear, and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things. I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general. We can't shelter our children forever, and sooner or later they will learn things we wish they didn't. This is an inevitable part of life. Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all, and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them. Do children need to be protected from some things? Yes, for a time, they do, but it is the role of the individual parent to protect their child. Protect the children, but don't do so at the expense of everyone else.  Why should the views of some hinder all others? Those who would presume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch. Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected from nature, from history, or from their own desires have no more right, and perhaps even less than everyone else, to interfere with individual decision - making. People have a right to make their own choices about what they believe, but no right to force those opinions on others.  This essay may make no difference, but it has said what needed to be said and thus served its purpose. With that task completed, I can finish with a good conscience, knowing that I've stood up for the principle of free access to knowledge in libraries.
317	3294	2	3	I believe that if you hear or read something offensive, it should stay for many reasons. I feel that everyone should know the history of the world, which unfortunately means encountering racism or being offended. If you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you, simply turn it off. You aren't being forced to listen or read it; it's your choice.  Libraries should keep the materials because the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but it's something people go through in life. There may be people out there that probably disagree with me; it's just my opinion. You might go to certain libraries in the world that don't allow certain people in because of their opinions on the selection of materials the library offers.  I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet. Maybe nothing happened to the person, but the fact is that she went to the police. She could have handled the situation herself, by just confronting the person about it. I feel that the moment she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police if it was just the person's opinion.  Libraries should keep the materials because maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offended. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were raised that way or just born with certain inclinations. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or may do something towards them in their lifetime, but they have to live with them.  In the end, whether they want to or not, libraries should keep certain materials, even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change their ways for certain people that don't like the materials. There are plenty of people in the world that want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic. It's just a part of life, and we should accept it as such.
318	3295	2	3	Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items may be offensive towards others? There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive, they should not have the right to take it off the shelf.  I believe that he or she should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive. For example, a student might want to read a book about abortion, but another person is against it and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as that student, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject.  Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book may be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive and they are then taken away, there will be a very limited amount of books for the other students to read.  Even though certain books may offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, etc., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection to respect the different interests and rights of all their patrons.
319	3296	2	3	"Dear [ORGANIZATION1], I disagree with removing materials from the library. I personally do not think it is the library's fault if someone is offended by books, movies, music, or magazines, etc. If they did not like the book or movie, it is their fault for picking it in the first place. Children who are under the age of thirteen should not be able to watch movies that are not suitable for them; they should not be seeing those inappropriate or scary movies at such a young age.  I want the libraries to think this over because it is not fair to adults or older children. Movies that are funny entertain children daily; some children even quote movies and make other children laugh. I know for a fact that us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day; well, that is what I do at least. There are some movies out there that are just so funny that I could quote every line of it.  Music, on the other hand, is very important to teens these days. It is always enjoyable to me. I love music; without it, I'm not quite sure where I would be in this world. I love many different kinds of music, most of it is very fun to listen to. I'm not a big fan of rock; you would not see me picking that up from the library. Us teens love music; we use music for pretty much everything. We dance to it, sing to it, workout to it, and most of all, we just enjoy it.  Books are always important. Even though I do not like to read that often, I still like to read books that interest me. For example, you would not see me reading a scary book because it would just remind me of the movie, and I would have nightmares. The books that interest me the most are fiction books. My two favorite books are A [CAPS1] To [CAPS2], and The [CAPS3] [CAPS4]. Both of those books are by the author [PERSON1]. I love all of his books, but these ones are the best.  Please rethink your decision about getting rid of the so - called ""bad"" music, books, and movies. After all, it is not the library's fault; it is the people who are borrowing them. If they do not like it, then they should have never taken it home in the first place. I say we just let it be and let people be happy, enjoying the diverse range of materials the library has to offer."
320	3297	2	3	There are many books that are not appropriate for children or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read them, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Children check out rated [NUM1] movies and rated [CAPS1] movies and unedited [CAPS2]'s and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at their age.  The libraries are supposed to make sure you're [NUM2] years of age before you check out a rated [CAPS1] movie. Also, you have to be a certain age to buy [CAPS2]'s and games that are for older teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulgar language. Today, kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different.  My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are inappropriate, but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulgar things. It should be your parents' decision to see if you're ready or not.  My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think you're ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree, there should be boundaries for teenagers and age privileges, and they should respect them enough not to cross those lines. By having these limits, we can better protect the younger generation from being exposed to inappropriate content too early.
321	3298	2	3	Many people base their actions on their own views. What, in their minds, appear to be justified due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this is media censorship. It happens daily, everywhere. Someone can take it upon themselves to, in their mind, 'make the piece better for general viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeding on the rights granted to us by the constitution: Freedom of the Press. First up, books in the library. Every time I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and, for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked - out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others may enjoy it, whether they share your views or not. People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as American citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should not be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I may learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable. With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called Freedom of the Press, and it is a right guaranteed to us, as American citizens, under the Constitution. And clearly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might not, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, may not be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it. People should not take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should not ruin the experience by marking the words out. Not only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should not be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in public libraries, the public should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the principles of the constitution, and it should be protected, not limited.
322	3299	2	3	Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive. All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books. Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have reasons for them. So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader. These books that are considered offensive to some people may not be offensive to others. For example, Sarah, who is from the South, comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the Civil War, and she reads that the South is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves. Sarah gets a bit offended by this. Then, on the other hand, Tom, who is an African - American historian, picks up the same book and reads all about the South and how they treated their slaves. Tom thinks that the same book that Sarah hated is a great book. As shown in the example, America's people are very diverse, but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens. A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race, it wants to appeal to all of them, the only way to have that happen is to accidentally offend some people in the process. The citizens of the United States need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here. If a book offends a person, that person simply should not read it. However, these books, which many may find offensive, could also be beneficial to its readers. Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it. Going back to the Civil War reference, Sarah was reading her high - school American history text book, and she read about the horrible deeds the South had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the Civil War to the Union, and she got offended because her side lost. Then, Tom, who is in the same class as Sarah, was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on. He found out that kids all over the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the Union defeated the South. Tom was as happy as he could be with this book, whereas Sarah couldn't be any more displeased. If this book was pitched out of the library, how would students all over the nation learn of the Civil War? They wouldn't. Libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone. As Katherine Paterson said, if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them, then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one, and so on and so forth. So, libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books. This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to. We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't.
323	3300	2	3	Censorship in libraries, in my opinion, is over - rated. Everywhere you hear of books, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because future generations need to know of the material, it may not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read. Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelves because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broader view as so many people are lucky to have today. Everyone has a different opinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person sees a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The Holocaust, because they think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The Holocaust is a big part in history and it being categorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten. Lastly, I believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offensive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children, their parents are the ones that could pick for them. With so many different opinions, it's hard to decide what to do about censorship. I believe that if it's offensive, maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either. In conclusion, we should balance the need for access to information with the concerns of those who find certain materials offensive, but not at the cost of hiding important parts of history and culture.
324	3301	2	3	Dear Sir/Madam, My name is John and I think that everyone has a right to their own opinion. People may not want their kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them where their kids can't find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than the movies, books, and music that children listen to, watch, or read. I think that the world is more harmful sometimes than anything. Adults may want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on TV. But, if their kids wanna learn about things that happen that aren't the greatest, then people should let them. It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people don't like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who don't like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchased at the age of eighteen. That's why people should be okay with things that don't involve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that it was made that way it should be kept that way. I'm sure many people may not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way. Sincerely, John.
325	3302	2	3	I believe as a citizen of this city and as an avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is necessary. Some of the material in the libraries today are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half - nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color? In today's libraries, there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' In the movie, the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the African - American children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is necessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is African - American, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in my opinion. In today's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You may think that it is okay to let your child watch a movie rated R, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet. Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked my mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries. Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You may think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary. I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It may be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite R movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child. In conclusion, implementing library censorship is a step towards protecting the young and impressionable minds from potentially harmful and offensive content, and it is a responsibility that libraries should take seriously.
326	3303	2	3	I'm writing this paper today to talk about the censorship of books, movies, music, etc. I firmly believe that there should only be certain appropriate things on the shelves that children can see. If you walk into a store or a video store, there are so many different kinds of materials that children are exposed to. They see various things, and seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is acceptable. I believe that there should be a very limited and carefully - selected selection that children can access. Things that are inappropriate should not be visible to children. I think that items that are bad should be removed from the regular shelves and placed somewhere less accessible. Also, the music on the radio is censored, yes, but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the uncensored words are. There are people that get offended by certain words, and these words are still present on the radio, on TV, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would be more careful about what they put in media. It makes people, especially children, believe that certain things are okay, and they are not. We should have very strict rules on such matters so that nothing inappropriate is shown to people, making them believe it is all acceptable. There are rules now on things like that, but it doesn't mean that underage children are still not getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are playing video games such as Call of Duty, and when they see shooting and other violent acts, they think it's okay and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask for an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things, and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less prevalent in our society.
327	3304	2	3	How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as, 'Hey, did you say to me that?' Would you want to keep things like that in your libraries? I would. I firmly think that anything that was hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and a valuable opportunity to learn. Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people are required to read and have. Sure, it might hurt, depress, or even aggravate some people, but it also fills you with in - depth knowledge on the past. For a person of any race, this is a way to truly feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation, this is a type of learning I would whole - heartedly welcome in libraries. Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either committed or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it, how can it be prevented? Books on the subject would provide essential help for those going through life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them practical tips or useful ideas on how to avoid suicide. I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it. In conclusion, I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public. I think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn. I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime, thus growing into a more informed and empathetic individual.
328	3305	2	3	Why should books or other such ideas be restricted? But let's get back to the subject. Should certain books be allowed to be in a library? Cause if you don't have a diverse range of books, you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick from, like history, poems, dramas, love stories, and scary tales. But some are not appropriate for certain places. Certain music is okay, but there are some that I would not approve of. Like rap, it's a bunch of people rhyming. That people think up in their heads about life. Something that they want to express by rapping. There is rock and roll. A lot of people did not care for it when it was introduced in the late 1950s, but as time went on, people started listening to it. But a lot of people did not want their kids listening to that back then. They said it was devil music. But in this day and age, a lot of people still listen to rock n roll because they were brought up on that kind of music. Movies, there are a lot of different movies out there. There are PG - 13 and rated R, but a lot of parents do not let their kids watch certain movies because they scare their kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people can't stand it. But there are shows for kids too; they are like a movie but a little shorter. Magazines are just a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines because they have a lot of time on their hands. But there are some people who can't get enough of magazines because they want to buy everything in the book. It catches their eyes by the way it looks. But there are all kinds of different magazines, like muscle - building, food, cleaning, and toys. But that's what I think about this kind of stuff. It sucks people in, but some can't get out. By the time they get out, they are broke. In summary, while these forms of media have their allure, we should be cautious about their influence on our lives and finances.
329	3306	2	3	If we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. It's not right to take away from others something because a select group of people take offense at it. Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There are many different reasons why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right. First, whether you find something offensive or not is largely based on your culture. To most Asian cultures, declining food is offensive. To Hindus, eating or hurting cows in any way is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it might be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone. Second, one of the best things about the United States is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library because someone found it offensive, I would be deeply disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs would be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shelf because someone took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal. Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a heavy - metal cover with a pentagram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's a reminder of why I believe what I do. I might be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group ISIS is greatly offended when they see the American flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed. I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many things offensive. It'd take away everything if we removed each and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind us of who we are. We should be strong enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what it was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of beliefs and not let the demand for the removal of offensive items undermine our fundamental rights and the richness of our cultural exchange.
330	3307	2	3	During school one day, all of our teachers told the class that most of the books in the library are going to be taken off the shelves. But our class doesn't want that to happen. All the teachers told us that some parents have been complaining about what their kids are reading. I think that most of the books that are in the library are good for the kids to look at because that's what they like, and they like to learn about what they would like to have or do someday. I also think that it is a great thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life. Later in life, when I have kids, I would like them to dream about what they want to do in their life. So if that means that they want to go to school and look at magazines all day and make sure that's what they want to do, that's fine with me. So if the teachers want the books off the shelves, they can, but I don't think that the kids are going to try hard if they can't be what they want to be later in their lifetime. I know that if they did that to my kids, I would buy them all the magazines they want so they can learn what they want to do in life. So if they take all the books off the shelves, I know that all the kids' parents are probably going to get mad because that's what messes up the kids' dreams. Now, when the kids want to read, the schools are taking all the good books off the shelves, and none of the kids are going to know what they want to do in their later life. A good thing to do is to let the students vote and see what they want to do about taking the books off the shelves. I bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures. That means that they want to be something when they grow up. I hope that my kid wants to be something that he likes to do when he grows up. I will help any kid as much as I can with their dreams. There are two things that are going to happen. One is that the school is going to take the books off the shelves, and the students are not going to try in school, and they might not know what they want to be. Or they might just give up on it all. And I know that no one wants that to happen. The second thing is that the school is going to keep the books on the shelves, and the students are going to want to read them more. Also, they will probably know what they want to do later in their lifetime. If I could pick what to do, I would keep the books on the shelves. In conclusion, keeping the books on the shelves is clearly the better choice as it nurtures students' dreams and motivation in school.
331	3308	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries. I firmly think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being has distinct tastes in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In today's generation, people hold diverse views on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because individuals have different likes, thoughts, lifestyles, and learning desires. Everyone is a unique individual. If libraries were to censor what they offer, not everyone would be able to read, listen to, and watch what they prefer. This would make people feel left out. For example, if the library only stocked romance materials, what would action - loving people do? A library is a place for all who visit it. It's not just for one specific type of person. Everyone grows up in a different environment. Children don't choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch, while others don't. Kids with non - censoring parents might have different interests. People don't all like the same things. In school, students mostly learn the required basic information. Outside of school, there's a vast amount of knowledge to explore. People can go to libraries to learn about various things they're interested in. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to other diverse topics. If libraries censored their materials, not everyone would get to learn the extra information they want. Libraries must not censor their materials! I firmly oppose libraries censoring what they put out for the public. People are different, and that's okay. If libraries censor, not everyone will have equal opportunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they wish. Since not every parent chooses to censor what their kids get at the library, kids have different interests. Humans don't always want to learn the same things. Libraries that censor are denying everyone an equal chance to learn. Please let people be themselves! Don't censor what libraries offer, such as books, music, movies, and magazines.
332	3309	2	3	I believe it is clearly wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three solid reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below. But before I begin, I'd like to emphasize that most people want to censor things that they fear. If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive, then the next person who comes looking for that book can't access it. How can this be considered fair? In life, there are numerous things that can offend people, but that's just how life is. You have to learn to overlook those things. Everyone has the right to form their own views and opinions on things, but they can't do so if they don't read other people's opinions. Reading expands our vocabulary at any age. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean someone else can't like it. You have to give them a chance to form an opinion. Libraries are widespread. If you're worried about your children finding books you don't want them to see, take them to a library with sections. All libraries are divided into sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section, and there shouldn't be any concerns. Once your children get older, allow them to explore the library and develop an opinion on the types of books they enjoy most. We live in a place that, since its founding, has been centered around freedom. Some people don't have the money to buy books or access the internet. So, these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can't find a subject that interests them, they won't read. They might even be looking for a specific book and can't find it because it was taken off the shelf. There's also a religion - related issue. There are many different versions of certain religious texts, and there are numerous religions. People come from all backgrounds. So, if they don't believe in a particular religious text, do we take it off the shelves too? In closing, I'd like to add that I can understand why some people would want to censor certain things. However, most of the things people don't like to see are things they fear. These people can't hide from reality. Not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect. Instead, let's do our best to contribute to the well - being of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish.
333	3310	2	3	Cooling the relevant topic: Key aspects and considerations. From Book by a certain author. Censorship in public libraries would be a blatant insult to the institution. A library, which serves as a citadel of knowledge, should not be restricted by society regarding what knowledge it can convey. One crucial role of a library, which is a destination for researchers, is to offer information that people need to seek. For those who can't find information at home without fear, or those who can't ask questions without facing retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are impartial; they are incapable of judgment. To censor the books held in a library is to undermine human progress. The freedom of thought and the freedom of press, which are present in our nation and are becoming more prominent around the world, rule out the idea of this censorship. If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, then aren't all books worthy of the same scrutiny? To devalue one opinion or perspective over another is to degrade the entire culture from which libraries have emerged. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The purpose of bringing books together under one roof is to give them equal standing as literature or scholarly works. From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time and has deprived me of parts of my life. Growing up in a small town where ideas of gender and sexuality were rather rigid, any search for dissenting opinion was often in vain. When I visited my school's library as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little help. Around the library, there were countless stories of a man and woman falling in love, but I never found a fairy - tale of two princes. It was only after I left the school that I discovered such books did exist in my old school library, but they were kept removed, off the shelves, and restricted. More insulting than finding books on certain issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so differently. Here lies the core problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. This is the essence of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life - choice until it fades away. But books can't force their values on readers. They can't push information on us. Books must be actively read; we must consent to receive their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might surprise us, we have to pick up a book and open it to gain its guidance. If my library had fulfilled its duty and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself but might have also learned to accept others more readily. In the past few years, with the far - reaching effects of certain global events reaching the newest generation, a particular place has been searching for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of specific tragedies. However, the country finds that it can't effectively memorialize these tragedies. When trying to construct a monument, the government and culture realize they have little to base it on. The results of murder and book - burning have created an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what could be called 'anti - monuments', commemorating a void for future generations to remember what was lost. One of the most powerful examples, at least to me, is in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall with gaping holes in the shape of book spines, stretching across the rows. This represents the knowledge lost from book - burning. We can't even describe what's lost because the knowledge has vanished. We must ask ourselves, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taken from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it? This is the detrimental effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its rightful place on a shelf is to metaphorically set its words on fire. Once it's gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our future generations and enlighten our descendants, we must work hard to preserve all books, regardless of whether they seem offensive, disgusting, brave, or new. Let the reader decide a book's value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance, as it might have an unrealized power. Leave the libraries as they are, as monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.
334	3311	2	3	Have you ever truly wondered how libraries pick their books? Well, I know I've often pondered this question. There is some material out there that no responsible person wants a little kid to get their hands on. I firmly believe censorship should be allowed in libraries. The censorship of books is vital for the kids of the world to live a life away from books about violence. Another reason is that it not only affects the lives of the children but also the social lives of everyone. Additionally, the overrated music of our generation is also a concern. My reasons on this subject can be viewed from two different perspectives, but I'd like to present it from my point of view. Look around. Are there little children nearby? Well, if there are, you should be paying attention to what they're reading or doing. The children might be reading books that are far too explicit for their age. Take, for example, a six - year - old child who has no restrictions. One day, the child decides to check out a book at the library. The child gets a book that is about violence and sex. What can the parent do when the child brings that book home? In many cases, the parents do nothing because they don't seem to care about their own child. It's high time for librarians to step up. Take a stand and censor those books. This is exactly what could happen to anyone's child if there are books out there that could be harmful to anyone who picks them up. Children aren't the only ones affected by this so - called 'disease' of non - censored books. Think about the conversations that take place in schools and at the workplace. What are these conversations mostly about? I'd venture to guess that they're mostly about sex and violence. How do these conversations start? Well, the main reason is the uncensored books at the library. Anyone can check out a book at the library, from the elderly to toddlers. When I was little, my parents used to tell me to go to the library and learn something. But what if the library didn't have censored books? What would I be reading? Our social lives are greatly affected by what we learn and how we learn the material. Lastly, why is it that every time I turn on the radio, there's always a song that's inappropriate for anyone to listen to? I sometimes listen to the radio station @NUM1, and all the music is mostly about violence. Guess what? The libraries have some of the compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station. At the library, there are sections for books, music, movies, etc. All of this material combined can create a social disaster if it isn't censored. I firmly believe that censoring music is the right path. If people never read or learned about violence from uncensored sources, our world wouldn't be so obsessed with it. Why should we continue to suffer because of uncensored books at the library? Take a chance and fight for what you believe in. Vote for censored books. A library is a place to sit and enjoy a safe and educational environment. It's not a place for violence. So, let's put an end to this and create a safer environment. No one deserves to be exposed to the damaging violence of uncensored books and music.
335	3312	2	3	@CAPS1', the woman shrieked as she had just received a fierce, sharp, and sudden stab in the back by her abusive husband. This kind of disturbing violence is what children might read about all around the world. To think that all the inappropriate stuff children see around the world on television, the internet, and even in what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well, you're wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are completely unacceptable. This is precisely why books and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the world. In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, we have magazines. These magazines are often very graphic. Kids will often choose to read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kids draw disrespectful things in them. As if that weren't bad enough, they also rip them in half and do many other destructive things to them. One of the reasons why I think the world has so many problems with criminal behavior is that kids these days feel they can draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren't their property. This makes them think they can do whatever they want. Kids read about crazy things that aren't really teaching them anything useful. Unless, of course, you want them to learn about a zombie apocalypse where zombies take over the world. Having such books in a school public library, what is that teaching kids? Absolutely nothing. Instead, it might teach them to take the book home and show their little brother or sister a cuss word in the book, which is clearly teaching them bad things. These are all valid points for censoring or removing some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries or possibly censoring some of the cussing. The last point I'll touch on in this discussion is the significant loss of money that some schools face due to damaged books and stolen property. Also, let's not forget all the dirty pictures kids draw in the magazines and books. Schools lose a large amount of money because of this. They could save a much - needed amount of money if they didn't let those books leave the classroom or school library. Kids wouldn't be able to draw in them, steal them, or damage them. All
336	3313	2	3	I believe that there should be a bit of censorship in libraries. There are indeed some books out there that could be a little offensive and might cause some minor problems. However, I also firmly believe that even if a book is insulting, you shouldn't be able to hide it from others. There are some books that contain some pretty nasty content that you can find in a library. Since a library is a public place, lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid from getting to one of these books, or the movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check out something that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuendo? What can you do about this problem? You could censor the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another issue. The idea of censorship might sound okay at first, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a bit over the top. If you are an adult and you're in the mood to read something with a little violence in it, you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read. So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way, the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone who is allowed to. In conclusion, a balanced approach with age - restrictions is the best way to handle potentially offensive materials in libraries.
337	3314	2	3	People all judge things differently. That's why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What might be found as an offensive book to one person might not be to another one. If there are people saying that certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library only if a significant number of people have the same concern. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive. What might be offensive to one person might interest another. The person that doesn't think it is offensive should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights of people away because a single person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it. I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and sometimes have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter reading or watching them, it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. That's not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group. I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also, that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometimes people like those types of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library. All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have the rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is. In conclusion, libraries should respect the diverse reading preferences of all patrons by maintaining a balanced collection and using age - appropriate sections.
338	3315	2	3	Over time, libraries have been used as a major resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies, and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gateway for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on their shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine, etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelf because of its content. Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people might find offensive or just completely oblivious to. Every mind is different when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch, or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. Whenever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed in a different section of the library. Many books that people find as explicit content to them might not be to others. When I was in middle school, I heard a lot about sex and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how it was. What I did know was that I could get accessible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks and researches it. If I would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probably never been warned about the outcomes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a library and observe, not everyone is reading a book about rainbows and unicorns. Many people read books about real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others call explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kinds of content, regardless of others' concerns. Also, libraries can do many things so that certain contents are not near others. They can organize their topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen - or - older books, movies, magazines, or music should be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library, far from the reach where kids and children are able to access. In conclusion, I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines, music, or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelf no matter what. No book should be removed because someone might find it offensive. If a person finds something offensive, they should take it up with the author or publishers, not the library for they only let people borrow the content. Libraries should provide access while also ensuring safety for younger patrons through proper organization.
339	3316	2	3	Censorship is a topic that is strongly opinionated. If one person does not like the content of a text, that person might find themselves saying that they have the right to prevent others from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn't they have a say too? Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two' perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in this situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and perhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In this case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed to have a right to say and think what they feel about the text. Should 'person one' still have the right to say that this text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there would be nothing left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazine, book, and text that there is available. Some might say that this is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material. Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explicit.' This is an indicator that a person who could find foul language offensive should not buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explicit', there is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the content considered to be disrespectful is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so - called: happy - median. Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explicit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, you know that this material is not for you. Again, the happy - median. For every given case of a group of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in this case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should this context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material. In conclusion, a balanced approach with proper labeling and alternatives is the best way to handle potentially offensive content in public media.
340	3317	2	3	Have you ever got or checked out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't, but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex - related content. I'm not racist, but some people are very racist. Some of the books in libraries aren't suitable for some viewers, but yet again they can check it out. Some books, movies, magazines, and other materials should be taken into consideration for being removed so some viewers can't read them. In libraries, there are books that have a lot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could interest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in later life. This could be very bad because the young viewer could talk his friends into becoming what he is, talking them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are families that are racist. Which I don't get because we are all the same to me. In some books in the library, there is sex talk that occurs in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't suitable for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different gender. Which is okay if you're older but if you're really young and reading a book with sex talk in it, well, that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of lifestyle till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let my kid read a book like that. Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter if it's rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kinds of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well, rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certain rappers say bad words that aren't really suitable for young viewers. Although some of the racism and censorship that should be censored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separate room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past. In conclusion, libraries should separate potentially harmful materials for the safety of young patrons while still preserving the historical and educational value of such content.
341	3318	2	3	New @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids or family to read? I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books or movies. I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the @CAPS3. This @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 should only be entered by an adult, or with an adult's permission.  Little kids often see what their peers are doing and want to be just like them, so they do the same stuff. What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true. By having this separated @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3, it gives parents the chance to keep the racist, drug - gang filled, and murder books away from the children. This will be good for every race too! If an African - American family does not want their child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the @CAPS1 of books where slavery and gangs are. Some books are really emotional and can trigger a person's emotions. If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themselves.  I think by separating the bad - influencing books from the good - influencing books it will help a lot. People under the age of @NUM1 are not permitted to be in this @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 without a parent, or a parent's signature. So come on down to the @CAPS2 council on @DATE1 and vote for the new @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3! Thank you for your time, and let's make a better environment for our kids in the @CAPS3.
342	3319	2	3	"Censorships in the libraries would be like cutting the world's air supply. It would be taking away from a reader's imagination, stopping readers from being able to express their mind freely.  My view on censorship in the libraries is that it would not be needed. Libraries around the world do a good job of keeping certain books at the appropriate age levels. By removing certain materials from libraries, it would arouse readers' curiosity about why they are being removed. Then readers would demand that we leave their books alone. They might then fight for more books like those, and that could lead to the need for censorships in libraries.  Books were made to keep people wondering, learning, and excited. By cutting away different materials, we would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds. The more you take books away, the higher the population of people watching television gets. Then there would be fewer authors and more actors and actresses. People's minds would not be engaged in wondering, learning, or being excited.  I remember when I was a little girl, I went to the library. I was in the library looking for a book. I went to the ""big kids' side"" as I called it and tried to check the book out. The library lady told me I was too young and showed me to the books suitable for my age level and took the book back. Then I was able to check a book out.  So all I am saying is that censorships are not needed in libraries. That would be taking away from a librarian's job. So don't take away readers' imagination, and let them explore the vast world of books freely."
343	3320	2	3	There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all the media out there, and that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life, then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living.  When children go to a library, usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate, it is up to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allows for their child to have access to offensive media, then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright.  If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has, they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material, you should have to show some sort of identification proving it.  A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.  I conclude that in order for someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material, that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature, then they should try to make it against the law, but we should also respect the rights of others to access non - illegal materials.
344	3321	2	3	Censorship, that's a word that causes a lot of arguments in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries, dictators do not allow their citizens to have internet access, watch the news, or in some more extreme cases, not even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they do not want the citizens of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment, meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country, but the people actually in the country have no idea what's going on around them.  Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense, it still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files is censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio where all of the original words are still intact? Arguments over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much progress at all. Each side of the argument, whether it's for or against censorship, is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or not. It's just too hard to determine whose opinion is really more convincing.  In my opinion, I don't think anything should be censored. If the writer of a TV show throws in a vulgar word, most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The same thing goes for songs. When an artist writes the lyrics to a song, they are trying to convey a message, and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing too much violence on TV and that it is causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suitable for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things. Rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun, just don't let your kids watch that show.  In the United States today, we have something called freedom. We exercise this right every day with what we wear and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on TV, you can make a decision simply not to watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO. If you don't want to hear or see something, simply choose something else to watch, or even just do something entirely different. You do not have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's an easy solution. All you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born and just say no, I don't want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or not things need to be censored.
345	3322	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all of them should be put in different sections of the library by age.  All the children's books and magazines should be in one section. The young adult and or teen books and magazines should be in a section by themselves. Then the adult books and magazines should be in their own section. Even the autobiographies and documentaries should be in their own section too.  It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if you are a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the young adults.  So yes, the parents who are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager, that person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate.  Like I said, the best thing to do is put all the books in sub - categories by age. It would make things much easier and faster to find the book of your selection, ensuring that both children and adults can access the appropriate materials in the library.
346	3323	2	3	It seems as if inappropriate materials are indeed found everywhere in today's world. Whether in colorful magazines, well - bound books, or the catchy lyrics of music, the possibilities of where offensive references can sneak in are truly endless, and they certainly pop up frequently these days. But should your sources of accessing these materials be restricted due to other people's morals or values? I firmly disagree with this act, and I would like to tell you precisely why I do. All of us possess different morals, values, and senses of what is right and what is wrong; each person's set of beliefs is unique. Maybe it's your deeply - rooted religion or rich culture that keeps you away from these materials. But why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot obtain from their local library? I know I don't just speak for myself when I say I would be extremely annoyed if I couldn't get the books or materials I wanted or needed just because the person next to me doesn't agree with what is being discovered through researching it. I do believe certain things should be separated from other parts of the libraries. For example, books that would be found offensive to innocent children should be kept far away from where kids can easily pick out things in a library. That is completely understandable. But when things are being removed because certain people don't agree with them or find them offensive, that is when things are crossing the line. This nation was built on the grounds of freedom for what you believe in. So why should we force others to believe something we think? Just because I find something offensive, doesn't mean the person next to me does, which is completely fine with me. That is his or her own personal opinion, and what I believe should not prevent him or her from learning about the things they would like to. One way to fix this problem would be to separate things that could possibly be found offensive into another section of the library and to put out a clear sign or paper stating exactly what can be found in that section. In conclusion, no, I do not think libraries should be censored. I know I could walk into my local library and find things I found offensive right now, but I would not want my own opinion to affect someone else's viewing of that material. People should think about one another once in a while and not be so fixated on what they personally believe. The world is an opinionated place, if it were not we would have nothing. A library can be filled with useful materials, so the focus should be on what you can find in a library to help you, not on what is in the library that you do not want to see. If you find something offensive, simply stay away from it, but don't try to take it away from the rest of the world.
347	3324	2	3	Libraries should have censorship because young, impressionable kids could come and casually open and look at inappropriate materials. I think we should have it because it would ensure that the kids won't be exposed to such content. There are three reasons why they should have censorship. First, these materials can teach kids bad things, second, they can have a bad influence, and third, they simply don't need to be there. First, they can teach kids bad things. That is because once they start looking at it more, they might get curious and start imitating what they see. Then they would likely get in trouble, whether it's at home or at school. There is really no valid reason for them to be looking at such content at all. Second, it's a bad influence. They might go and tell and show their friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right. This could lead to a chain reaction where more kids get involved in inappropriate behavior, potentially ruining their futures. Third, there really isn't any reason they should be looking at it. Unless, by some very rare chance, a book fell from a bookcase and was lying on the floor where a child could easily spot it. But even then, there should be measures in place to prevent kids from accessing it. I think we should have censorship so it can't harm any kids, and so everyone would be on the right path in life.
348	3325	2	3	I think that a censorship in libraries isn't needed. The grounds that are basing the censorship are very subjective and biased ones. Two readers of one book could view the material completely differently. The reader has deliberately chosen to read that book, and thus more than likely know what the general plot is before they read the first page because of the detailed summary on the back. People are capable of making their own decisions, and can therefore choose whether or not to read the book to begin with. The books that would be found inappropriate or offensive would most likely be in teen novels or adult literature. If this is the case, they should be mature enough to handle stumbling across the material, and or making the decision to put the book back and to not continue reading. Saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct, but at that age the children should be with an adult when checking out books anyway. The material that people find unacceptable would almost certainly be in a novel that is intended for a mature audience, so if it is being read by a younger age group that would be the problem in and of itself. The teens and or adults whom would be reading such material are surely old enough to handle reading a few foul words and scattered innuendos throughout the plot. The material that might be found inappropriate or offensive might be viewed differently given two different audiences. A teen in high school has probably heard worse in the halls during passing; an adult that is worrying about what their children read has certainly been exposed to enough throughout their lifetime to either look past the text or to put it away. The material being called offensive just because of one person's views is not right. The tough situations and our surroundings are what prepare us for our futures. A person seeing the bad in life would be more likely to do all in their power to make good of their futures and be more willing to help make sure it could be prevented. Should the foul things in life be ignored? Should the child that is being beaten at home have to suffer in silence because it seems too graphic to tell? The man who became homeless, only to turn his life around because he learned from his past, should that story not be told only because the troubles he had to face seem too disturbing? I believe that these are the stories that need told the most, in an attempt to teach those around us how to prevent, and how to move past the troubles in life. There will always be things that we wish not to see in life. But is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are. The libraries should not be put on a censorship, but open to the public that wish to dive into these stories. Books are written for a purpose, and that purpose might just be to let people know that these things are happening, and if one thinks they are alone in these strifes that they are not.
349	3326	2	3	I believe that indeed certain books should not be on libraries' shelves. And some people might feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their prerogative. I believe that if you do not like the books then simply stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their children to read a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it ridiculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they don't take it upon themselves to force their parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it. I find that some people see books on sensitive topics like slavery and the Holocaust and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as an adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from things like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words, so what? Tell your kids to stay away from it if you think it's bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books, they should get a position and gather signatures saying that these books should be removed or at least moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on someone else. In the end, libraries should respect the diversity of opinions while also maintaining access to a wide range of knowledge.
350	3327	2	3	BOOKS Dear @PERSON1, I'm starting to tell you about the books in the libraries that some adults find offensive, especially for the kids. These books should be taken away so kids won't read them. The second part is that adults should protest so the libraries could get rid of those magazines and other inappropriate materials. And my last point is why do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they could read them. The first example I'm giving is that I found some books and other things that I consider being offensive for kids. And the libraries are letting kids read them without checking for an I.D because they are in the adults' reading sections. These books need to be removed so kids won't read offensive things or try to imitate them. They should have PBS - approved books so under - age children could read and so parents don't have to worry about what their kids are reading in their free time. The second example is that parents should protest so books or other such things could be removed. Parents need to protest so anything they find offensive should be taken off the shelf. Or another thing is they will have to make a detailed list of what books are offensive and let only adults read them by having an I.D, and that could sound a little better so books aren't completely removed. The last example is why do libraries let kids take them home and read them. They should focus on what kids need to read like educational books for school or for other useful things. Adults need to keep an eye on what their kids read these days. Kids need to understand what books are good for them according to their age, otherwise, their young brains will start getting confused. The conclusion is that libraries need to come up with a solution so children don't read these kinds of books that will only mess up with their innocent minds. Then their parents will not need to pay so their children could take therapy and help other kids so their brains could be in a better state. So please, libraries, do something so parents don't need to worry about what their kids read these days. Like for me, I won't like my kid read offensive things because they will start doing the same things, so libraries do something about these offensive things.
351	3328	2	3	In my opinion, I firmly think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries. I genuinely believe that people are smart enough to make their own well - informed decisions on what they want to read. There are a few valid reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public. The first reason why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because it's clearly showing disobedience to the principles of free access to knowledge. The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will over - use their authority, and it'll make many people form a bad opinion and have a negative review for that library. The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it'll completely change the whole peaceful and open environment of a library.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of blatant disobedience. I think that many people will use profanity and will adopt an “I don't care” attitude. If people use profanity at home, I'm a strong believer in leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public, especially in a library. Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will over - use their authority and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library. Some people over - use their authority by being extremely loud in the libraries, preventing others from concentrating on reading or engaging in something to occupy themselves. If a library is loud and obnoxious, it'll surely drive people away from the library. I think that a library should be a nice, quiet, and welcoming place. That'll make the library experience much more pleasant and the time there flow by easier.  At the end of the day, I think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in public. A library is a place to go read, study, complete homework assignments, etc. And finally, I think that people should be able to make decisions on their own whether they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can control their reactions and understanding of it. This way, the library can truly serve as a free and open space for all.
352	3329	2	3	I do believe that certain inappropriate stuff should be removed from the libraries, like materials that little kids should not be able to see. They should be placed in a separate room where you have to present an ID to get in. The library staff should ensure this is done properly because you don't want your little son accidentally looking at something like a Playboy magazine. I know I definitely don't want that for my child.  Little kids should not be reading books with a lot of swearing and other inappropriate content because no kid needs to act like that. It can bother them and they could get in trouble both at school and at home.  Yes, it might be true that adults like to read about sex and drugs, but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read? Some people just need to think carefully about what they are leaving out in the libraries because little kids are always eager to see new things all the time.  So next time you are working at the library or just visiting, you might want to pay close attention to where you put stuff because little kids will surely see it. By taking these precautions, we can create a more suitable environment for all library visitors, especially the young ones.
353	3330	2	3	Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things at some point in their lives. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and shield youth from seeing such content. They believe that parents should be the ones to tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced to these topics early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored.  Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, often wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would seem vulgar but then the government would have the right and responsibility to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to engage in any of that stuff.  That is not to say that newscasters should curse every time they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know.  At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with proper and right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to ask and get answers to their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would likely go down. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would become a normal part of communication, so kids would not be embarrassed if they had questions. This would change the world for the better, creating a more open and informed society.
354	3331	2	3	The library is well - known to be a place full of dreams and wonderful imagination. For some, the library is a sanctuary where you can escape the harsh realities of life and dive into a book where anything is possible. The library is filled with many books suitable for all ages. Therefore, books that are classified for one age group may not be appropriate for another age group. This is where a problem occurs. If the library chooses to keep books in it that are only appropriate for certain age groups, various issues can arise. The three main issues with this situation are that young children can access magazines they have no business looking at, some articles or books can be found offensive to some races creating an uproar, and also events and instances played out in books may not be appropriate for all age groups. We have to think about the books we have read, and seriously contemplate if we would want others, especially younger or more sensitive readers, to read it as well.  Young children are often daily visitors of the library. Most of them run around the library, getting into any and all books or magazines they happen to come across. This is not always a good thing. In the library, there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only. My family has had an experience with this sort of situation before. My mother, brother, and myself visited the library one evening. While my mother and I searched the library in a bit of a chaotic manner, my younger brother found himself searching the magazine rack for something to keep his mind occupied. Well, his mission was accomplished. On his search, my younger brother had found himself a Sports Illustrated magazine. Inside there were pictures that were revealed, and my mother was not at all happy about my brother seeing them. Instances like this happen every day in the local library. Staff members should think to put revealing works up to a place where the younger generation can not easily find them.  Throughout the library, there are many books dealing with past historic events. Although many find these books helpful and interesting, some find these books to be quite offensive. Some races have undergone painful events in history. Many of those people do not want to relive the painful past experiences. It is in my opinion that the library should oblige by the people, and take into consideration how different people feel about certain books. When I was a young girl in elementary school, I remember doing a whole unit on slavery and the underground railroad. While studying the unit, we were assigned a research assignment over the lesson. I chose to visit the library in search for books I could use to gather more information. While searching the library, I came across a book that my mother and I felt should not have been where younger people could see. The book enclosed many horrible acts against black people. This is a book that at my age, I should never have come across.  For me, reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a much - needed break. When I relax and enjoy a good book, I can't help but feel like nothing in the world can touch me. Although I love reading books, I don't like when I start reading a book and then have to stop because the book reveals events that I shouldn't be reading. One book I read was definitely not appropriate for me. Although I found the book in the young adult section, the book I read revealed a young girl encountering many rapes and beatings. Now that I look back, that is a book that I might enjoy now, a few years later, but I don't feel I should have encountered that book then.  What books should and shouldn't be encountered in the library is surely a never - ending feud. Many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences. I think that if the inappropriate books that should not be viewed by all ages were put away to where the younger audience couldn't get them, then the never - ending feud might be able to be put to rest, and the library could better serve all its visitors.
355	3332	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I do not believe they should be, but that is my well - considered opinion.  It is completely pointless to remove them from the shelves because the children are going to see that kind of material outside of school, so why should we remove it from the school library? Music, movies, magazines, and books all have material such as racism, murders, inappropriate language, etc. When we find materials like those listed before offensive outside of school, we usually stay away from them. We simply ignore it and choose to watch or read something that we do not find offensive.  Movies and books about certain controversial topics are sometimes found offensive to some people and if we remove them from our libraries then we can not have proper references for when we write essays over those topics. It would be extremely hard to get the right kind of accurate information off the internet because not everything on the internet is correct. One hundred percent of factual books in the library are reliable sources. You will have no worries then about the authenticity of the information.  Therefore, I do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed. It is a pointless task to do. Children see it outside of school and know how to stay away from it then, so they can also stay away from it in school. By keeping these materials in the library, we allow students to develop critical thinking skills and make their own judgments about the content, which is an important part of their education.
356	3333	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Just because some people think it's offensive doesn't mean all people think it's offensive. Some people, like those in @MONTH1, actually like the content it shows.   I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view. If something was removed every time someone walked in and found it offensive, then there would be no library. A library is supposed to be a place filled with a variety of books. It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes.   It is important to offer a lot of variety because if a library doesn't have a lot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers. A library doesn't want to target just kids, or teens, or adults. The library wants to target all aspects of people. Even if it means that some content is inappropriate. All books can seem inappropriate if you look at them in the wrong way.   I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Everyone has their own point of view. A library should have a variety of books. Not just one genre a person wants. In conclusion, maintaining the diversity of library content is crucial for meeting the needs and interests of all patrons.
357	3334	2	3	Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read @CAPS3, you deemed @CAPS3 as inappropriate for younger people? I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries. I blame myself for picking @CAPS3 up in the first place. Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions, and so they blame @CAPS3 on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles.   This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc. should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries. Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that @CAPS3 can't be helpful or entertaining to others. I think @CAPS3 should be a matter of choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the @TIME1. There are too many options, like when it comes to the books, movies, music, and magazines. If something strikes you as inappropriate, then simply take @CAPS3 back and exchange @CAPS3 for something better.   One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was @NUM1 years old. My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' I showed @CAPS3 to her just like any other time we had gone to the library. Only this time, she did not want me to check @CAPS3 out. She saw @CAPS3 as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait until I was older. @CAPS3 was about @CAPS1 abuse and she saw @CAPS3 as a very inappropriate book for my age, at the time. But she didn't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them.   Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out. My best friend's parents had been the same way with her. Only instead of a book, @CAPS3 was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to. They thought that she should not listen to @CAPS3 because the lyrics in the songs were too'sad' for her to hear. They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed @CAPS3. They did not blame the library. If someone else wanted to listen to @CAPS3, or have their children listen to @CAPS3, then it was their own personal choice.   I do not believe that libraries should have censorships. They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult. But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc. off the shelves just because of certain people. @CAPS3 should be a person's personal choice. If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their mistakes. In conclusion, personal choice and responsibility should prevail in the context of library content, rather than imposing censorship.
358	3335	2	3	I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelves. If you find something offensive then don't pick it up, it's that simple. You might find something offensive but it might not be to someone else. It is all according to your own personal opinion.   Sure, there are some things that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong. Because it might be offensive to you but what if there is someone studying that topic but can't find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf. Then it disrupts that person's study.   I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material, all I'm saying is if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek. It might be offensive to you but other people might not think the same way.   There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people. And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and titles to read and watch.   In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelves. It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to a lot of people. But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then don't pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic. For someone to take another person's right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong, everyone has their own opinions and rights. By respecting these individual rights, we can maintain a diverse and inclusive cultural environment.
359	3336	2	3	"There are some books that should not be removed from libraries due to censorship. From past experience with censorship, I found out it can tone down a book. In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, for example, the books are being burnt and it is causing society to fall apart. Censorship often comes from people with a more ethnic background who don't want the kids to grow up and see inappropriate language.   The most recent book that I have heard of getting censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The main word they are removing from this book is ""nigger"" because some people find this word very offensive to their race. The committees are trying to remove the books from school shelves.   I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them when eventually the kids will learn the words on their own or hear the words somewhere else. The kids can even learn the word from their own parent or from TV. I personally think that committees should stop trying to censor everything because they won't be able to censor how adults talk when they are around children and younger adults. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is an over - reaching measure that fails to address the real issue of language exposure and limits access to important literary works."
360	3337	2	3	Katherine Paterson, a well - known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree. She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.' If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there might not be anything left for people to read.   Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned. Many people have different views on what is right and wrong. Some might suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others might be offended by a different book. If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there might come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent.   Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students. Books often allow students to think in different, new ways. They can learn from a new point of view. Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values, which is a good thing. If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate, parents should respect the decision of this teacher. They might suggest another reading, or offer other ideas, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed is not right.   While removing books for reading might be going too far, things such as movies could go the other direction. Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them. I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do. Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing. If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be appalled at the cover as they pass.   Although parents care about the things their children read, books should not be banned. Although other things might have affects on youth, books are a different story. They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form opinions. They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering. In conclusion, the value of books in education and personal growth should be preserved, and the practice of banning them should be avoided.
361	3338	2	3	First off, I do like censorship laws to a certain extent. They can play a role in maintaining a basic level of decency in public spaces. However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem inappropriate. What one person or the government considers inappropriate might not be the same for others. I think it depends more on what the family deems inappropriate. A family has a better understanding of their children's values and maturity levels. I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages. Instead, proper guidance can be provided. I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content. This way, parents or guardians can decide if the material is suitable for their children. I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers' interests, then they should just not look at it. They are not required to look at it, so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it. However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else. And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them. But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about inappropriate material. As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it. I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials. One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privileges to books, because they deem it inappropriate. Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it. Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials. However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects individual choices and family values is the most appropriate way to handle the issue of potentially inappropriate content in libraries.
362	3339	2	3	There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this vast world. Some are funny, capable of making us burst into laughter; some are sad, bringing a tinge of melancholy; some are weird, sparking our curiosity; and some are scary, sending shivers down our spines. And then there are some that are questionable to others on whether it was even necessary to even put the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices. We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than others, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things, at times, come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybody's different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do? There's such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered whether it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. These materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it gives a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music. In conclusion, embracing the diversity of creative works in libraries is essential for fostering connection and free expression.
363	3340	2	3	There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries. These things can come in so many varieties, catering to different tastes and interests. Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked? Well, most people find a lot of things that interest them in many ways. Many people come to a library each day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listening, reading, or watching. So many people are different and each person likes something different from one another. So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelves because they're offensive?' From experience, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see. Though most libraries split a lot of their sections up by ages. Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provide the thing you want. Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong. I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magazine that was not their age group, but that children wanted to look up on that thing. You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age. As a parent or legal guardian, most children look up to you. If you read, listen, or watch something that is not to their age level, but the child wants to be just like you. Children look up to their parents or legal guardian. They want to do the same thing you do, so they copy you. They will find something that is similar to what you're doing. They might go find a book, movie, or CD that is not their age group. They will do this all because they want to be just like their parents or guardian. So as a parent or guardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to your children so they do not find offensive books or etc. There are so many reasons why people might think some things are offensive. Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today. Children today are growing up a lot faster than we want them to, but sometimes we cannot stop that. Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not their age group. Libraries can be a fun and learning environment for everyone. Just sometimes we all do not think alike or like the same stuff. There are just too many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries. I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varieties they carry. Have you ever thought though, 'It's us humans that makes the libraries carry these varieties?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library. We the people are the ones that want these books, movies, magazines, and music. So think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you do not think is right. Think about how someone really likes that. We all need to accept things if we like it or not at times. Just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive. In conclusion, by setting good examples and respecting the diversity of library materials, we can ensure that libraries remain a valuable resource for all.
364	3341	2	3	Libraries should have whatever they want in the library. Everyone has their own thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on their shelves then don't go there anymore or pick up something you like. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else. Materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff off the shelves just because they're offensive to you. The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right. Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs - materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everything for facts. So don't start taking stuff off your shelves. Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is offensive. If you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts. No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you're taking off offensive items. Libraries are open to anyone that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about. Music - everybody has their own type of music you can't just start taking music off because you think it's offensive. Most people have their own type of everything. Children are their own person. You can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life. They get older you won't be able to tell them what to do or what not to do. If you keep them from a book or etc. they might end up reading it in the long run. Keeping your kids safe is important, I understand. Your kids are going to experience things you don't want them to. Just by taking offensive stuff off the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't find them somewhere else. I could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family. But most of the time, you're going to have offensive things come up in your life. That means you're going to have to not let it get under your skin or get over it. Things get under people's skin too easy. This is why the world doesn't get along. If you don't like something don't be around it. Find something else to read about. That's what I do if I don't like something. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection, and individuals should respect different perspectives and make their own choices.
365	3342	2	3	Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace. You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get - away. But, here's the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shelves. So, do we remove these things or let them stay? My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they may contain a few vulgar words or images. It's the same with magazines and movies. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music. Just because one person may find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. Many history books contain harsh, real - life facts about things that went on in the past. A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it. Another good example is movies. Some people may find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less. Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else. There are many movies nowadays that can be seen as very offensive. But honestly, the offensive things happening just make someone else want to know more about what's going on. It is practically the same with books. I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted. Even though in the end, I find them to be exceptionally good books. It just depends on how you view it. So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non - offensive book could even be found. My advice to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who may react strongly. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with. In conclusion, maintaining a diverse and uncensored library collection, while taking appropriate precautions, is crucial for the intellectual growth and freedom of all library users.
366	3343	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I firmly believe that the books and other items should remain on the shelves of the library, as censorship in libraries is entirely unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson clearly stated, there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the community finds offensive. What is offensive to one person may not be considered offensive from another person's point of view. Children, teens, and adults all have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch, or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen, then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case, I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies, but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only way to live. A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice based on the way they have been raised or simply because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive, then they don't have to read it; they have the right to say no and put the book back on the shelf. If they think that the book is appropriate, then they can read it, and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it, there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with. If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive, you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things, listening to offensive music, or watching violent or rated R movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things, then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the community. The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem, and if it becomes a problem in the parents' eyes, then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books, watching the bad movies, and listening to the music that they view as offensive. Every parent and family is different. As long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in, then there is no need for censorship in libraries. In my family, I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive may be different from what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs, but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in may not be the right thing in another family's view. Every person has their own right, and if they want to listen to that music, then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now, I should not watch rated R movies. If you took all the rated R movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone, and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated R movies. What my family believes may not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for, and I will do what I think is right; I won't listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies. In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every person's own right, and they are capable of making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can monitor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to, and if they find it offensive, they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive, and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age - appropriate. Just as in Katherine Paterson's quote, everyone has the same rights, and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view, and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the community has to follow.
367	3344	2	3	Offensive media is everywhere. From books filled with explicit content to music lyrics laced with profanity, our culture bombards us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can easily pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers, as they may use language or display actions that are not socially acceptable. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy, and they may become violent or depressed, as they start to question their values and the world around them. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediately. Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on TV or see someone doing drugs, they may imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media for a long period of time, they may think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind are being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind. Another reason why libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing, so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy. Finally, inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a DUI in a magazine, they may think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they may want to try and experiment with drugs themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them. Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media, they may think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing, or doing drugs which, in turn, can lead to being emotionally unhealthy. Without inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths, and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted, with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves.
368	3345	2	3	All of us have rights, and all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think, or believe. Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have, and nobody can take that away from us: it's just something that belongs to ourselves, and that everybody does have. As humans, it is not easy to understand other people's thoughts, and it could turn kind of hard to accept the opinions that strangers from us can bring. A library is a place where we can find all kinds of material that can easily answer many of our questions. Sometimes, some material can be offensive and make a target group of people feel uncomfortable, while there is also material that can be really helpful through our searching. If I had the right to remove any magazine, book, or movie off the shelf, I would at least think about it before removing it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it. And if everybody else had the same right as me, then we wouldn't have any material at all in the library. Music is a big topic to talk about. We all know there are people that are really used to listening to a type of music that other people can call 'rude music', and it could be pretty offensive for kids. I truly believe it won't be fair for any of us to label people because of the music they like, the books they read, or the movies they watch. We need to understand that nobody is better than nobody else, and we also need to respect other people's feelings. It's something that we have to work on continuously, as it is an essential part of a harmonious society.
369	3346	2	3	Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not. Different people have different life experiences, values, and beliefs, which shape their perspectives on what is offensive. I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story, and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive. Maybe the author was trying to explore a complex topic or tell a unique story, and the interpretation of offensiveness came from the readers' preconceived notions. In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view. The author probably didn't mean for the book or magazine to be offensive, and removing it would limit the diversity of ideas and stories available to the public.
370	3347	2	3	Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday. Many people believe that some material is unsuitable. I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some. I believe people have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws. I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship, but I am also for it when laws are being broken. I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want. Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another person's mistake. Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people. I think that when it becomes a threat to the nation, they should remove material. For example, if a book promotes violence against the state or provides instructions for illegal activities, it should be dealt with accordingly. Another simple fact is that the constitution of the nation states that we have the freedom of speech, which basically means we may print and read whatever we want. Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer, and sometimes there is a book, article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits. I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves. I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad, or give bad thoughts or ideas. The government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair? I understand their logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society. I believe that if people want to experience it, they should be able to without wondering if it will be gone the next day. If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it. This is a true - enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic. So, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read? I don't believe so, but that is my opinion. I believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material. Freedom of speech is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that may be assumed 'offensive'? It is a complex issue that requires a balance between protecting the rights of individuals and maintaining the safety and well - being of the nation.
371	3348	2	3	Have you ever come across books, movies, music, and magazines that deal with drugs, sexuality, and violence? I firmly believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the library shelves if they are related to drugs, sexuality, and violence. There are several reasons for this stance. One reason is that little kids might get hold of books, certain types of music, movies, and magazines that contain drugs, sexuality, and violence, and then they could learn how to engage in such behaviors. A second reason is that I feel a library is not the place for parents and their kids to read about, watch, or listen to materials that involve drugs, sexuality, and violence. The third reason is that these kinds of materials belong in another building, a building far from children where only certain people can enter and access the books, magazines, watch the movies, and listen to the music that contain such content. The last reason is based on my experience. Once, I found a book about drugs. When I looked at it, I realized it was highly inappropriate for little kids. It had pictures of what drugs look like and what certain drugs can do to the body. In conclusion, I hope that whoever is reading this will recognize the negative impact these books, movies, music, and magazines can have on those who read, watch, and listen to them.
372	3349	2	3	There are numerous books in the library that some people might find offensive to young readers today. I firmly believe that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have the right to read whatever they choose. There are multiple reasons for my view. First of all, there are so many books that could be considered 'offensive.' If you were to remove all of these offending books, you would essentially be removing half of the books in the library. Most young - adult books involve teens, drugs, violence, and other elements that might seem offensive. These are the very books that teenagers often read. Just because they read them doesn't mean their actions will be influenced. These types of books are mainly for entertainment and are not intended to harm or offend anyone. Secondly, I think people have the right to choose what they read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this very purpose. Everyone has different opinions and tastes regarding what they like or dislike. Finally, I believe that censoring what is on the shelves would be a mistake. There are many great books or movies that could be found offensive, and taking them off the shelf would make them less well - known. Children would be unaware of them and might miss out on some wonderful stories. Everyone has an opinion, and it's understandable for parents to watch out for their children. However, censoring what is available at the library would make it more difficult for others to find books. Libraries are meant to offer a variety of materials because everyone has different tastes.
373	3350	2	3	I don't think these materials should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has the right to read such materials at some point, but with a restriction that no little kids can rent the book. If people are complaining about a book being vulgar or sexual, you shouldn't simply take it away. Instead, you could try creating an adult section. One person might love a book that has some violence in it, while on the other hand, you might have a very religious person who can't stand to see it. There are numerous viewpoints on this topic. There are parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of lifestyle. Some people don't think it's as bad as others do. If you don't like a book on the shelf and don't want it in plain sight, should you really be the one to decide whether it's taken down? Some parents don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final say on what gets removed, it could affect the kids' reading habits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose to remove those kinds of books from the shelf? Then they might not want to read the remaining books. I'd rather read a book that interests me than one I dislike. My point of view on this topic is straightforward. I don't think parents should control what we read as long as it's appropriate. I believe the decision should be left to the government to determine which books should and shouldn't be taken away.
374	3351	2	3	When it comes to censorship, I firmly believe that very few things should be removed. Just because some people find a material offensive doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone. A material should only be removed if it offends an overwhelming majority of people. If you find it offensive, simply ignore it; you don't have to buy it. Maybe someone else finds it interesting and it contains the information they've been seeking. When it comes to books, music, movies, or magazines, I believe almost anything should be allowed, except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. A little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but if it's too extreme, it should probably be kept away from small children. Usually, if a child is exposed to such material, they may grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completely acceptable. Sometimes it's violence, sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case may be. Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their children to bad morals. But in my opinion, if you're a good parent, you shouldn't have to worry about this. If you really don't want your child to be exposed to it, take action. For example, if you don't want your child watching a certain television show, block it. Don't just assume they won't watch it and then get mad at the show's creators when they do. It's not their fault; perhaps you as a parent should have ensured in the first place that your child didn't see that material. There are some people who believe that if any material depicts anything bad, it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is a free country and people can read and write whatever they want. If you have something to say about it, that's fine. People should be able to exercise their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed.
375	3352	2	3	Yes, children should not be reading materials that are of this nature. Children should be reading books that have good information, information that they can learn while in class. If books, music, and other reading and viewing materials have bad content, they should be removed from the shelf because children should not be exposed to such things. Some music contains bad language, and children should not be listening to such music. Also, movies that have inappropriate scenes should not be watched by children as it's not good for them to see all that. Parents should take action if their children are watching movies with inappropriate scenes. Magazines with inappropriate pictures are also not suitable for children as they are too young to see that. In conclusion, it is crucial to protect children from such inappropriate materials to ensure their healthy development.
376	3353	2	3	My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes, some books, music, movies, magazines, and other media should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves, some very young children or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has inappropriate content meant for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with 'What does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know what to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always ready to explain or want to explain such things right away. Everyone goes through life learning different things at different rates. Some things should be taught when we are young, like how to brush our teeth, but some things should be left until we are older, like having babies or drinking alcohol. When parents are going through the explanation of something like making babies, you do not want it to be when the child is only five years old. With books in a library that have pictures of men and women in compromising situations, questions like that do get asked too young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age, whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and I would not want a child reading a vulgar or explicit book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it; it could also be something related to religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a Christian your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with Jews, they will ask someone about it. Young kids and teens can always find things that they shouldn't at certain ages, but why not make it less likely by having proper library censorship? When you were younger, your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked well for so many years, so we should not have to change it now.
377	3354	2	3	I don't believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, simply don't read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a certain race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about certain things to get attention. If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would be very helpful, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a controversial book in a school library, but it's probably because I did not spend much time looking for it. And if there isn't one, it's probably because someone complained about it. If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. There are all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I don't know why some people have so many problems with certain things. Like I said before, if you don't like it, don't read it. In conclusion, libraries should offer a wide range of books without unnecessary censorship.
378	3355	2	3	I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if children look elsewhere to find those things, then they will find them at any time. The offensive materials are out there and can be picked up by some people, including children. The books aren't offensive when found in the adult area. If so found there, children wouldn't read them because they are too long for them and the books don't have any pictures. Music can be offensive, but as I said, it's only found in the adult area. Kids aren't interested in that kind of music at that age, so they wouldn't bother to look at it. Movies and magazines can have offensive things in them and can be found anywhere, but finding them in a library is going to be rare. The only thing you will likely find in a library that is offensive is a magazine. They make a bunch of different types of them, and they can be found anywhere. To explain the offensive and the non - offensive books that are out there, I'm going to talk about 'The Offensive Book'. This book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, and racism. This book is so offensive that the children's parents wouldn't let them read it, but this book is based on a true story. Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why the people in that story were doing those things. Some books may be offensive, but you can learn from others' mistakes by reading that book. Everything may be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view, it's a learning experience. People who made those mistakes could tell the children that those things aren't worth it. Everything has its purpose. The books can tell you the story of people's lives, and the movies are based on the stories, so instead you can watch them. Music can tell you the life of people through poetry. Magazines really don't have much of a point; they're just there to gossip. In the end, offensive materials in libraries can serve as valuable learning tools.
379	3356	2	3	Is the censorship in libraries really necessary? In my opinion, it is but only to a certain extent. I believe that most people who frequently go to the library know what types of books, movies, magazines, etc. are for the adult group and what is for the teenage/children group. I think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions they see in these materials and using them in their daily lives. If we don't want them to read or even hear certain things, I think the censorship is a great thing in many ways. I believe if the censorship was to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of censorship that was a bit more favorable for adults. The censorship would still be present at the library in a certain form. There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out. If we could, when people are checking out these books, movies, magazines, etc., we could use a rating system just like movies do. When a child who is 10 years old comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in, they could bring it to the librarian. The librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with their library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child. There could be many ratings, like PG, PG - 13, R, and NC - 17. I think ages 5 - 10 are for the PG - PG - 13, the ages 11 - 15 are for the R and ages 16 and up for rated NC - 17. I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc. that make them think it is okay to do or say these things. I think not. In my opinion, this idea could help our youth and their parents make better choices in the content they are exposed to. So if you feel like this is a good idea, contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the new system, 'The Library Rating System'. Don't wait until you have forgotten, call now. In this way, we can have a more balanced approach to library content.
380	3357	2	3	Books, movies, music, and even magazines are all important in our life and environment. They all have a learning process. When you read, you learn; when you watch a movie, you learn; even when you listen to music, you can learn. Whether it's about the past, present, or future, everyone has the right to learn as it's part of being a citizen. Speaking of all this, I believe just because one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable, you shouldn't take it away. That's not only taking away from your kid or yourself; it's taking away from everyone else. Just like the book 'Huckleberry Finn', it's a wonderful book. I love it because it's about the old days when they still believed in slavery, and there were still some good - hearted people around. This book to some would be very offensive because of the fact it has the word 'nigger' in it one - hundred and twenty - seven times. In fact, last year at my school, a mother tried to get it taken out. Her son was actually a mixed boy, but thankfully the committee saved it, and it's still here. That's our history, and everyone needs to learn some of it, whether it's offensive or not. As well as movies that can and mostly likely are offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either. Like I said earlier, that's taking away from everyone else. If you don't want to see it, then don't buy it, or if something that you find inappropriate comes on, just change the channel. History is important, and I don't think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you want to learn or need to learn for the future. Now, the music part I can understand. Some music may be a little inappropriate for younger listeners, so like I said before, change the station or don't buy that album. Don't deprive people of what they want to learn, watch, or listen to. People that feel offended or embarrassed should be ashamed of themselves because that is very selfish and rude. No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened. If they put it in a nice way, then it would all just be a lie. That's why I don't believe in censorship. It should not happen. Any book, movie, magazine, album should be available to those who want it. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of information in various media and not let censorship limit our learning.
381	3358	2	3	People often view libraries as excellent sources of knowledge, simply an information - filled place. Many individuals have a fondness for libraries, while some actually dread just hearing the word, 'Library'. To be honest, in my life these days, I only know a few people who use libraries as an information source. But can some information from libraries be offensive to others? To be quite honest, the answer depends on your own opinion. However, yes, I think some information that can be obtained from your local library can be rather disturbing, 'per say'. There are books and information that you wish you'd never picked up in your entire life, but then again, that's the case everywhere.   Now, music, movies, etc. follow a similar pattern. Some people may not agree with what he/she picks out and what they might be interested in. Can it be offensive to people? Of course it can, but people have different views. You may not agree on something, but your friend might think entirely differently from you. Everyone is entitled to their opinion on anything, well, normally. Now, if there are graphic movies or explicit music on the shelf where your little son or daughter can easily grab them, I can see that as a major issue.   Some parents do not want their children listening to that kind of music at such a young age. Even though in America, your child will likely hear or see those things as it's part of life. If a five - year - old can pull a graphic movie or a CD that a parent doesn't want them to see or hear, then I don't necessarily think it should be banned from the library. I believe it should be handled in a well - mannered way and moved to a place not so easily accessible to a five - year - old. These are common arguments people have about many places and similar disagreements.   Yes, I agree some things found in a library can be offensive to some, but my answer remains, 'No', it shouldn't be removed unless it really is extremely offensive. If there is something that offensive in the library and multiple people in the community find it offensive, I would take it up with the people in charge of the local library.
382	3359	2	3	I think that if you feel like certain books, magazines, music, or movies are saying bad things, you should simply refrain from reading the books or magazines, stop listening to the music, and avoid watching the movies. If you find something offensive, just don't look at it because another person might not find it offensive at all. It's a part of life to encounter something offensive, so why let it bother you now?   I think that if people start removing offensive content, they might just take some TV shows off the air because there are a lot of shows out there that are offensive, and some people don't like them, but they don't take those shows off the air. So, why take books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves? I don't believe that they should do that at all. If I don't like something, I don't look at it, so I don't get mad at what somebody says about my beliefs.   A person might not like the same music you like. I might not like the same music he or she likes, but I don't want to take it off the shelves. People should just stop paying attention to all the things that others say about their beliefs. In conclusion, we should respect different preferences and not try to remove content just because it might be offensive to some.
383	3360	2	3	Libraries should not be able to remove books, movies, and magazines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magazines, and books that most kids love to read and watch, then the kids who like those books, movies, and magazines would not return to the library any more.   For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If you're with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull into the parking lot listening to your rap music, some people may not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.   Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child wants to check out a book or magazine or rent a movie, they should have the child's parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magazine, or movie. Libraries should also have an age limit to check out books and magazines. If kids want to rent a movie, then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. This permission slip can be used for all movies.   Libraries should not remove their books, magazines, or movies. They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out. So, access to library material should be a choice based on proper authorization. In this way, libraries can maintain a diverse collection while also respecting the concerns of parents.
384	3361	2	3	Some people may think that certain books, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they may be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.   What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slightly rude, another person may have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truly offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is entitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definition of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's.   I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am a [specific religious group]. Basically, I do not believe in [a certain religious concept]. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some other religious people may find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting.   I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be contradicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf.   In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truly be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid their shelves of 'offensive' material, as it goes against the principles of equality and the free - flow of ideas.
385	3362	2	3	Dear [Recipient's Title]:  Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by such materials? These are the questions you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.   As a concerned citizen, I am writing to you to reflect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences, I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people who still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a separate room for the offensive materials. If there was a separate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids.   When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid - friendly place. In order to make that happen, we need to find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere where anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover new things, or an old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials is not needed in a library.   Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children, it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they may not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid - friendly places so that all ages can enjoy what it has to offer.   As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials, that is not possible. Please consider setting up a separate area for such materials or removing them altogether to ensure the library remains a welcoming place for everyone.  Kind regards,  [Your Name].
386	3363	2	3	They need to remove the bookstores because all students want the library to have a wide variety of books, such as Spanish books or those related to different cultures. With these books, students can learn different languages and engage in various activities. For example, they can read extensively and even rewrite the same book using different words. Also, the music and movies in the library need to be removed as some DVDs contain inappropriate content. Take libraries around the world for instance; people often want to borrow books for free, and they expect libraries to be free - access places. Moreover, libraries should expand their reach globally. Many people think this is a great idea, but some oppose it, arguing that libraries may face difficulties in lending out books, DVDs, magazines, etc. That's why libraries need to make people aware of their lending policies. I believe libraries should interact with the public, showcase their collections, and lend out books and DVDs as people desire. Sometimes, libraries can rent out interesting DVDs that are hard to find elsewhere, like new movies. If the library doesn't have a particular DVD, people can inform the bookstore about it. Reading more is indeed a great idea, and libraries should enhance their appeal to excite people to pick up books and read. In conclusion, libraries need to balance the needs of the public and their management policies to better serve the community.
387	3364	2	3	Censorship is important, especially when it comes to the books, magazines, movies, and music that the vast majority of people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media, such as books and magazines in libraries everywhere, can be highly offensive to certain individuals or convey the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we remove them from the shelves? I personally think no. Most media items on library shelves can be offensive to some people, but a lot of this perception depends on personal opinions. It's the readers who claim that the books and other media in libraries are offensive. The authors, directors, and singers simply create their works, and the judgment and opinions come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't remove everything from library shelves just because it offends some individuals. This ties back to the quote from Katherine Paterson: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't remove everything because everyone's opinions differ. If we censor everything, there will be nothing left. Currently, efforts are being made in censorship, such as rating video - games and movies. Rated R movies are known to be for adult viewers, and the same goes for video games. The music played on the radio is censored to remove foul language. This gives people the choice to watch, listen, or read what they want, and they should be aware beforehand that it might offend them. Although some people feel that the current level of censorship is insufficient, this is about all that can be done to avoid offending others. Removing all media due to people's opinions could potentially upset others or deprive them of the content they want to read or watch. Censorship can be beneficial without removing all media from the shelves and the world. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship is necessary to ensure that everyone's interests are considered.
388	3365	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I know, just like everyone else, that you can find almost any reading - related material in the library. There is a wide range of items, from children's books to love stories, people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, but the question is, is everyone allowed to access whatever they want? I personally think it's a good idea to have all this material in the library, even though some of it may not be very appropriate. For those who don't have easy access to a library at home, the library might be the first place they think of when they want to learn about something specific. We can't really control what people might find in the library, but I believe it's beneficial to keep such diverse materials in a public place. You can search for information on the internet, but what if the internet doesn't have what you're looking for? I, for one, prefer books to the internet. Anyone can post information on the computer, but in a book, the information is more likely to be true because it has to go through the publication process and be reviewed by someone who wouldn't allow false information to reach the public. If librarians are worried about under - aged kids accessing inappropriate books, they can take measures like placing adult books in a separate adult section and restricting children from entering. They can also put these books on high shelves so that kids won't even notice them. In all the libraries I've visited, there were separate sections for adults and kids. If parents are concerned about what their kids might find, they can keep them at home and create their own home libraries, where they can choose which books and magazines to include. In conclusion, libraries should manage their collections in a way that balances the access for all users while also considering the concerns of different groups.
389	3366	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because they contain uncensored content? My opinion is a definite no! Now, don't misunderstand me. I'm not someone who always likes reading such materials, but every once in a while, there's a really good book or magazine with uncensored content that I'd like to read. The problem is that I'm often told I can't because it contains something that teenagers supposedly shouldn't see. One of my main questions is why statues from early Roman times are allowed in our history books, even though they are often of naked people, while other materials from our own time are restricted. We live in an era where people are more open - minded, and it doesn't bother most of us to see such things. Yes, some materials may not be suitable for teenagers my age, but I hear offensive things every day when I walk through the halls of my high school. Someone might have an opinion that the material is offensive, but if it's so offensive, why do they even bother complaining or thinking about it? Everyone has the right to their own opinion, but that doesn't mean their opinion is always correct. Different people have different opinions, and we can't say whose opinion is right. Another point I want to make is that we teenagers are learning to make our own decisions. In the near future, we'll be adults and will have to make choices on our own. So, we should be allowed to decide whether we want to read materials with uncensored content. It's our choice, and we should be able to make it without others dictating to us. I still don't understand why it's such a big deal to read uncensored material. Libraries should allow these materials, and we should be trusted to make our own decisions as we are learning to be more adult - like. In conclusion, teenagers should be given the freedom to access a variety of materials in libraries and make their own choices.
390	3367	2	3	The censorship of certain media is a highly controversial topic. Whether a particular piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored is often a matter of opinion rather than a logical decision. It's difficult for most people to step into others' shoes, be open to different viewpoints, or escape the pressure of public opinion. There are many reasons for censorship. Sometimes, media is so intentionally offensive that the creator might even welcome the controversy, or a new and radical view is considered offensive simply because it's different. So, when does someone have the right to take a song off the air or permanently remove a book from a shelf? The first thing to consider is whether something is offensive. There are extreme cases in media where one might wonder, 'What were they thinking when they made that?' For example, a movie that is extremely graphic or violent. However, what one person might consider unnecessary gore in a film could be exactly what another person is excited to see at the cinema - it's all a matter of opinion. Another interesting aspect is that someone might come up with a revolutionary scientific theory and present it in a book or documentary, but certain groups might claim it's offensive. Yet, when we investigate the theory ourselves, we may not be offended at all. This is understandable because people grow up in an environment with its own set of ethics and principles, which they tend to hold onto throughout their lives. If a piece of media goes against someone's deeply - held beliefs, they will naturally be offended. But does that mean it should be censored just because it offends a few groups? The decision of whether to remove something from public access depends on the opinions of the general public. Public opinion is shaped by the current time, trends, ethics, and ongoing problems. When something goes against too many of these factors, people get upset. If most people are upset, the media is likely to disappear. It's bad for business, and libraries are already losing customers as fewer people have the urge to read with all the other entertainment options available. If a library has too many controversial items that put a bad taste in people's mouths, they may stop visiting. So, when it comes to censorship in libraries or anywhere else, it's all about opinions. If the general public doesn't like something, it will stop being available. Some books and media seek controversy, while others accidentally go against certain groups. In conclusion, censorship is a complex issue based on a multitude of opinions, and a balanced approach is needed to ensure that both the public's sensibilities and the freedom of expression are respected.
391	3368	2	3	Isn't it truly shocking that some books, music, movies, and magazines you come across on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones? I firmly believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening to or viewing this item, then it shouldn't be in or around a children's section at all. Some content could be offensive not just to children but also to teenagers and adults. Some music may contain words that children shouldn't be exposed to. Music such as hip - hop and rap often contain degrading comments about men and/or women. I wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music or reading any book that talks about it. Music can also be offensive to cultures, religions, sexual orientations, and races. Books or music with such comments should have notes written on them stating what they contain. I was reading a book called 'Adventures of Tom' that I had picked up in the child section. After the first chapter, I wondered who would call this a children's book. The character was using profanity and talking about sex throughout. My child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie and then find out it's not about pie. I once was watching a movie with my two - year - old that we got from the library. The movie was full of inappropriate words, so I had to shut it off. Movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view. I now have to worry about what we check out. I also have had a few bad reading experiences. Magazines are a big issue. Some magazines might contain content such as inappropriate pictures and words. Magazines should stay at the grocery store rather than a library that I take my child to. Books, music, movies, and magazines should stay out of the children's section if they are only meant for adult viewing; keep them in the adult section. Any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today. Offensive content shouldn't be found in the library at all. I know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading and ensure their exposure to appropriate materials.
392	3369	2	3	All kids have their own style of books. Some people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think about how taking certain books off the shelf would affect more than one person. Some people may be mature enough to read the more 'grown - up' books or magazines. Libraries have all types of styles for different people; you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you. I do not agree that certain books and or magazines can be taken as offensive. All libraries have different types of books. For example, an elementary school library will not have grown - up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think about whether peer pressure affects what books or magazines kids read. For instance, when I was in middle school, my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading 'Encyclopedia Brown', and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did. Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I believe that if there are 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them; you don't have to get that book. We can't just take the more grown - up books out because some kids don't know what they're supposed to be reading. Libraries have all different styles of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suits you, and don't take all the books that have an offensive style off the shelf. Don't judge a book by its cover, as everyone has different preferences and maturity levels when it comes to reading.
393	3370	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1 If one thinks about it, books are such a magical escape from everyday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at any time. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all. I feel as if this would become an all - too - real reality if we censor books. Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be read or placed into circulation? This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book, everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should be withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor. If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size, the feeling is not pleasant. No one necessarily said anything mean or hurtful; it just feels as if restrictions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to an amusement park with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest, I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those height requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a TV show? Honestly, some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective. There is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to read a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally different from not getting to. The popular book 'To Kill A Mockingbird' was banned at one time in the United States simply for using the 'n - word'. This angers many, especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the civil rights movement affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of its history. Do we need to have a filter to read? Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms? If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship, as it restricts the free flow of ideas and knowledge.
394	3371	2	3	When one person is given a right to do something, then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing. But every so often, you have someone that abuses their rights to something. I believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a right on a library shelf. And they shouldn't be removed if they are found offensive because in almost every book someone reads, there will be some kind of offense in it. I also believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a purpose to it. And if the purpose is good enough for it to be published, then it should have a good message worth delivering to people, even if it is a little offensive. I've read a few books, watched a few movies, and heard a few songs that were offensive even to me in some way. But, considering that there was more of a purpose to it, and the purpose being a good message, I liked the few movies and songs that most people would say are 'junk'. I don't have a lot of experiences because there isn't a lot that I can say is offensive, but the few songs and movies that are offensive to even me, I believe that there was some kind of good message there. I personally think that no one should have a right to take a book, a piece of music, a magazine, or anything else off a library shelf. Because everything has some kind of purpose to it and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover. We should respect the diversity of content in libraries and allow individuals to make their own choices about what to engage with.
395	3372	2	3	Yes, I think they should be removed from the shelves. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overrated, and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelf for kids, teenagers, and grown - ups. Everybody should have their own section for their age group. Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street and hanging with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out these days, children shouldn't listen to it. It has too much cursing and is very violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things. There are certain things teenagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I'd rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you're doing behind closed doors; they've been through everything you're doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things. I think there should be certain restrictions on magazines in the library. Young children beat themselves up because they don't look like the young actors and actresses in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they're not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt, and young men want to have big muscles and be buff. In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be completely removed from the shelves. There should be a shelf for young kids, teenagers, and adults. The music that is played on the radio these days shouldn't be on there without proper warnings. Magazines shouldn't be out on shelves for children to reach easily. There are certain things teenagers should watch and read, and libraries should be more proactive in providing age - appropriate materials to ensure the healthy development of young readers and viewers.
396	3373	2	3	I honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries. If you think about it, there is a well - known law called freedom of speech. This fundamental law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something just for what it says. Also, in my opinion, if you find it offensive, you simply don't have to look at it, read it, or listen to it.   I remember walking through the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books neatly arranged on the shelves. None of these books really seemed offensive at first glance. Then again, this library had an upstairs area where the more 'colorful' books were placed. For example, some adult books with explicit content etc. These books were indeed offensive to some, but they should not be banned. Instead, they should only be moved to a more appropriate location.   On a different occasion, I remember walking through the library trying to find a book to help me with an assignment at school and I saw several young kids curiously looking at some adult books and magazines. I believe that these were put here for advertisements, however, they should be advertised in different areas out of the sight of kids and teenagers.   Although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned, it would be quite difficult to accomplish. I don't think that anything should ever be banned for what it says, shows, or sounds like. Instead, it should be moved from one area to a different area. For example, instead of placing certain materials at low levels where younger people can easily get their hands on them, they should be placed at a higher level or behind the desk. In conclusion, libraries should maintain an open - access policy while also taking steps to protect the sensibilities of different patrons.
397	3374	2	3	Have you ever found a book offensive? Many people can say they have. They might not agree on the central point of the book or certain controversial viewpoints in the text. When this happens, people often stop reading the book and other books in the same category. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone has their own opinions, and if we start removing books based on individual sensitivities, what would be left in the library?   At my public library, citizens of my city can request certain books, movies, music, or magazines to be put on the shelves. We are very fortunate to have this service available because if someone cannot afford certain books, they can always rely on the library. Many people have been very thankful for this democratic system.   If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive, what would happen? More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library. There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library, and that does not mean you have to read all of them. There are also many different genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines. Everyone has interests in different types. If people all liked the same things, life would surely be boring.   In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. If a specific book is requested and one person finds it offending, the book should stay in the library. There are many different genres of books, music, movies, and magazines. Imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed, you would likely stop going. So, libraries should respect the diverse interests of all patrons.
398	3375	2	3	I think libraries shouldn't remove material from the shelves even though it's offensive. The libraries shouldn't remove offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people, other people still might want to learn about that topic. For example, the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books, there is some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that was stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that as offensive, but other people from different races or religions might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesn't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, and no one has the right to tell one person what they can or can't like.   If censorship starts to occur in libraries or other community places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offended by the material. They might think that they are being told what they can or can't read, listen to, or believe in. That will cause a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simpler if libraries keep the materials on the shelves and people who are getting offended by what's there should ignore it. After all, why would they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended by what one person says, but who cares? Not everyone is going to think or agree with what is being said. It's just a person's point of view. Let them be themselves and just stick with what you think of yourself and in your beliefs. Not everyone is right and perfect, so just be yourself. In the end, libraries should uphold the principle of free access to information while allowing individuals to make their own choices.
399	3376	2	3	Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decide what they see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are valuable materials used by everyone, and for some, a library provides a haven where they can get their hands on such things and nowhere else. So, we shouldn't try to take away any of these things from anybody.   One reason why certain materials should not be removed from library shelves is that there will always be some subjects and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feel differently. And if we allow them to be taken away, you will only be taking away a person's own choice, which is something we all should strive not to do. Also, just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't? Is there really one person who could make such a choice for everyone? Also, there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying, you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue about. I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied, then why bother.   Another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials, you would be interfering with education. Books, movies, and other such things are used for learning, even whether people realize it or not, and the more opportunities a person has to learn, the better. And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about? There has, in fact, been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decided that the public should not be educated or know about certain things, and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society. A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a society that in this situation should not hinder a person's ability to learn.   Also, I realize some people @MONTH1 argue that for young children, some materials are better left unviewed, but that is where parents come in. It's their responsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone else's. And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parent's choice as long as it is in agreement with the law.   These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decide what materials and subjects are put on their shelves. For some decisions, no one can make them to satisfy everyone and to be in the right. Therefore, it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place of free - access and open - minded learning.
400	3377	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed, unless if it has nudity or a large amount of cussing in the books. Because some books and movies are inappropriate to show little kids. But I think we should have anything that teaches you something in the library. Plus, people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if it's about something with a little cussing and is somewhat graphic, it should be okay. I think if the library has these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines, they should have a policy where you can access them if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher stating that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choose any kind of book but with permission.   The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better - quality ones. Because most of the things that people like are in the books or movies that the library won't have. So it just depends on the situation. There is a lot of offensive things out there, but it doesn't mean you can keep it away from people. They will find out anyways sooner or later. I think it's unnecessary for the libraries to be overly restrictive. I always hate when I try to get something and then find out you have to be @NUM1 or older or have an adult with you. Plus, some people don't have computers or internet access, so they can't look up things easily. They have to drive down to the library to look something up, and if you are lucky, they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they don't, that's disappointing. So, in my view, libraries should balance the need to protect younger patrons while still providing a wide range of educational and interesting materials. In conclusion, libraries should adopt a reasonable approach to handling potentially offensive materials to serve all patrons effectively.
401	3378	2	3	People believe that censorship is important in libraries. They firmly believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They strongly feel that it is sending a very bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this, and these are the reasons why. I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf if they have cuss words inside. I genuinely feel that they should continue to be sold even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are a lot of truly horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and I feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isn't that big of a deal. There is so much more to worry about than a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside, and I also read books with bad words, and it doesn't influence me in any kind of way. So, we shouldn't always try to control everyone. We should just let these items be on the shelves and let them or their parents decide if it's inappropriate or not. In conclusion, I feel again that they should be on the shelves, and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. If it doesn't harm anyone or themselves, then let it go on and happen. Let them do what they want to.
402	3379	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 @CAPS3, it's a @MONTH1 concern. I'm writing you to explain that in @MONTH1, students are extremely tired of students in their school not returning books to their school library. Many students have a report due on a book that a fellow classmate didn't return. Many students either simply forget they have a book out or even let it go past due. So, it makes it incredibly hard upon the student who is trying to do a report. If the books, music, magazines, and etc., are not returned, people should have to be punished more than just having to pay an overdue fee. I have witnessed a large number of students who didn't either want to turn in the book they checked out. We, the junior class at my high school, had a term paper that we needed books, newspapers, internet sources, and magazines for. Luckily, the senior class turned in all of their books, newspapers, internet materials, magazines, and etc., that they used on their term papers. As a result, we, the junior class, were able to succeed on our term paper. But many juniors still haven't returned the materials they have used. The teachers have threatened them with overdue fees and or having to pay for the lost material. I see that having to pay an overdue fee and or having to pay for the lost materials doesn't seem to bother them. Even though teachers make them pay, the future classes will have to struggle and go out and purchase books, magazines, and etc. The classes that have to take @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and do their term paper in @MONTH1 will not be able to succeed. It is unfair that they have to worry about whether they will have the materials they need for them to succeed and do their term paper. I think if the schools took the time out and got parents involved, they wouldn't have as many students who don't follow rules. Students think that their teachers can't tell them what to do. Maybe if their parents were involved, they would follow directions and turn in their books, magazines, and etc. In conclusion, if someone wants to take a book, they should provide a lot of their personal information as well as their school name. If people don't return their books, there won't be anything left for other people to use. So, I say everybody does have the right to use the books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. to their advantage. Just try to remember to return them for other students as well.
403	3380	2	3	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. You have the clear right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to. Certain books, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed just because someone else doesn't like it. If someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion, then they have a simple option to not read or look at it. Something that someone might find offensive might be really interesting to someone else or they might have to do a report or project on it. There's absolutely no need to discriminate against a book or movie just because a certain religion group or someone as an individual doesn't approve of it. It's a public library that has materials on display for the public! Any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please. A library is open to the public, which means people of different races, beliefs, religions, etc., are going to come through, and it's a real possibility that they're going to see something offensive or that they don't like. They have the option of either picking it up and reading it or the option of not paying it any attention and ignoring it. The choice is theirs to either let someone else's opinion actually bother them or not let their opinion matter at all and just keep doing their own thing. People have to be strong enough to rise above all the negativity and keep doing their thing and keep believing in what they believe in. It doesn't matter if someone hates or has hateful things to say about you or your particular beliefs. Don't pay them any mind at all. I know you think censorship should be in public libraries, but that isn't fair to the people that are maybe being offended, but they don't have to read it if they don't want to. They need to learn that in life there's going to be people that don't like them. Even people that @MONTH1 might have hurtful or hateful comments to say about you. Learn to be strong enough to stand tall in what you believe in and don't let haters or other people's opinions bring you down.
404	3381	2	3	I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be completely empty bookshelves. I firmly believe that the library has a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 people say that the library has inappropriate books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections, for example, adult, young adult, children, and reference. I've never actually seen a book that was offensive to me in a library, which brings me to another point. Everyone has an opinion. If a book is offensive to you, it might not be offensive to someone else. For example, say that you saw a book on animal mating, and you thought it was a bad book for the library to have because little kids might pick it up. Well, that is your opinion because if a biology teacher saw a book like that, then they might really want to check it out. Another thing is that the library has certain books for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves. This book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, but this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others. In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things, and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be taken off shelves.
405	3382	2	3	There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature, movies, music, or etcetera. I truly understand this, but I don't think they should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it. Other people might really like it, or they might like it themselves if they give it a chance. Before you go saying that you don't like something, maybe you should really give it a chance. Maybe try looking at a few pages of a book you once heard about. Watch at least one or two episodes of a television show. Before you make an ultimate decision about something, give it a chance first. Some people don't like some media because it goes against their beliefs. If this is the case, then just simply ignore it. If you don't like a certain type of music, don't listen to it. Maybe it is a movie you're not particularly fond of, then don't watch it. In conclusion, people should learn to give some things a chance. They should also not get rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it offensive. That said, I don't believe that certain media should be banned. We should respect the diversity of tastes and opinions and allow a wide range of media to be available for people to choose from.
406	3383	2	3	For many students, it is extremely hard to compose essays in a public school's library. Acquiring the necessary information in such a setting is comparable to painstakingly finding a needle in a haystack. This predicament is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No, neither of these problems is the cause behind many students' inability to compose thought - provoking essays and in - depth analysis over a myriad of topics. This is primarily due to the extreme levels of censorship that are being imposed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevant topics and materials needed to truly understand our constantly changing world are being removed from the reach of those who will go on to lead this new world. Some prime examples of this tyranny on knowledge are the removal of books such as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these, according to many parents, has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy, along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial slurs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works reference racism, drugs, murder, sex, and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent might advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries. These reasons, as well - meaning as they might be, are no longer good enough to be valid in today's changing environment. Many of the books that have been recommended to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, 'history is written by the victors.' Although it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery, it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the viewpoint from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again. For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries, they need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbidden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist. It is far better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb.
407	3384	2	3	Should offensive material be removed from the library? I firmly think no, and there are numerous reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not meant to offend people; rather, they are just a means for the author to let the reader know how they feel. I believe that the books, movies, magazines, etc., should stay on the shelf because if they are removed, what are we left with? It seems like all that would remain would be the dictionary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake. So, what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gossip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet, people find these topics to be offensive, probably due to that person's background. If someone finds a read to be offensive, then they should simply stop reading, and that should be it. Instead, people decide to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and have it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want, and if they disagree with that subject, they should just move on with their lives. At the library I attend, many people of different shapes and sizes walk through the door every day. Many of them like a different subject than the others, so it's common to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure, someone here and there does not agree with an author, but they never decide to go crazy about it. Instead, they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the author for his writing. In my own reads, I have found at times stuff I disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are meant to be for one type of audience when instead another audience sees the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four - year - old to watch, and their parents should not get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listened to the guidelines, then there would be no problem. I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc., should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree, well, they should just deal with it. In my own experience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidelines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe we will have something to worry about. But until then, we should keep our nation's libraries the way they are today.
408	3385	2	3	There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive. Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, careful observations, and/or in - depth reading. I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding this issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story. No matter what your opinion on this issue is, there will always be someone who opposes it. You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc. The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world will inevitably come in contact with something that they might have thought to be offensive. When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take offense at some point in life. I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored. Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time. When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials? The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive. There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them. Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice. It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that might be offensive to some people. Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement. Almost every well - written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored. What would those books be without those statements? To conclude this debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship. Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people. Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on this subject, but that is just the way things are. We might never know who is actually right or wrong about this topic. We do know though, that judging from the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.
409	3386	2	3	Have you ever vividly imagined a world without movies or music to entertain you? A world that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read, then there will be no creativity in the world. There will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen to, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. If the world is left without certain materials, there will be a complete lack of creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are portrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned. This will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently. In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone, and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone, and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self - expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it. Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as an offensive topic, then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic, you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc. Eventually, everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts. I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be completely eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self - expression. If you haven't ever thought about a world without books, movies, music, or magazines, I hope you have learned how cruel and boring the world would be without all of those materials.
410	3387	2	3	Any one has the right to anything. They have the right to speak freely; to watch what they please; and so on. The censorship on the media depends on various factors. People who like that sort of thing can go to a place where they can buy both censored and uncensored items. Every place these days has censored books, CDs, video games, etc. But then they also have uncensored items. For those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf, they have options. Also, on @CAPS1, parents complain about what's on @CAPS1. Well, there is a channel button, and you can easily change the channel. Or even in today's advanced technology, you can block that channel from ever being watched. No body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying. People have the right to choose what they want to buy, whether it's censored or not. They can say or do as they please as long as it's within the rights of laws. It's all about your style and what you let your child see. @CAPS3, @CAPS3. It's not as easy to keep children from the vulgar things in the new technology. They go to a friend's house, and that child's parents don't care and let their child watch anything from @CAPS4 - @CAPS5 rated. The most you let your child watch is @NUM1. It's extremely hard to keep a child sheltered from what you'd prefer them not to see. But what people have to realize is that they're going to find out one way or another. Also, a child who is sheltered will often go to the extremes to find out what's on the other side of the railroad tracks, to get a taste of the water, to see what they have been missing out on. Children will be children, and they will sneak behind your back and do what they want to because they never knew what it was like in the first place. Any one has the right to anything. You as a person choose not to allow your child, who is a @NUM2 - year - old, a rated game, but his @NUM3 - year - old friend does have it. Remember, he's going to play it at his friend's house. Everybody has a different taste on censorship. Some think everything should be a little cleaner; others think differently. So, thanks to both sides, stores sell to you what you prefer. In the end, it's important to strike a balance between personal choice and the overall well - being of society, allowing individuals the freedom to make decisions while also being aware of the influence of the media on the younger generation.
411	3388	2	3	@CAPS1 represents the freedom of speech, which allows individuals to read, write, and listen to whatever they desire, but this freedom comes with certain conditions. I firmly believe that all books should remain on the library shelves. As Americans, we possess the freedom to express our thoughts and feelings without fear of consequences. However, we must also exercise responsibility and consider the impact of our words and actions. If something is wrong or harmful to others, we should take full ownership of our mistakes.  That being said, I do agree that some books should be removed from the shelves if they promote ideas or thoughts that could lead to the downfall of our country. For instance, books related to terrorist groups, drugs, and alcohol should be taken off to prevent the pollution of our youth's minds. Today's youth is highly influenced by the music they listen to, the books they read, and the television they watch. These mediums shape their behavior, dress style, emotions, and how they treat others.  @CAPS1 is indeed the freedom of speech, but we must choose our words wisely and be cautious about what we say. One day, our words could have a significant impact on us. Therefore, it is essential to use our freedom of speech responsibly and ensure that our words contribute positively to society.
412	3389	2	3	People should not take all the books out of the library because other people would likely like to look at those books as well. If people start taking books out without any restrictions, all the books will be gone. This means that there will be no books left for others to look at or check out. So, there should be a law that limits the number of books a person can check out at a time and the duration for which they can keep the books.  Having a set period for borrowing books would help to keep all the books in the library. If people simply take books without returning them on time, there won't be any books left in the library for others to check out. Therefore, a law should be implemented that specifies the maximum number of books a person can check out and the length of time they can have them. If a person fails to bring the books back within the specified time, they will be charged a fee. The fee will increase every day the books are not returned. Additionally, if the person does not pay the bill, they will not be allowed to check out books until the amount is paid. This would be an effective way to prevent people from stealing or taking books without permission.  Regarding the books, movies, and magazines in the library, they should all stay on the shelves. If you take out one item, you should take out all of them because everyone needs to have access to these resources. Even if an item contains something that some people may consider inappropriate, such as a movie or a magazine, it should still remain on the shelves. Removing one item would be unfair to the author, who spent time creating it. If authors get angry, they may stop making books for us to read.  In conclusion, it is important to have rules and regulations in place to ensure that everyone has equal access to the library's resources. By implementing a borrowing limit and a fee system for late returns, we can encourage people to be responsible and respectful of the library's property. Additionally, keeping all the books, movies, and magazines on the shelves allows everyone to have the opportunity to explore and learn from these resources.
413	3390	2	3	I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the shelves and placed in a single room in the library, labeled as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 section. At most libraries, there is a dedicated space for kids' books. However, when children go with their parents or someone older to the areas where the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 materials are located, they may not understand what they are looking at when they randomly pick up a book or a video.  Some people @MONTH1 think that this arrangement is not ideal because they are concerned about who might see them entering the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 room. However, if they don't want to be seen, they can simply choose not to go in. By secluding the @CAPS1 books, magazines, videos, etc., we can protect children from accidentally picking up materials with uncensored pictures or grabbing a video that their parents @MONTH1 not approve of. This can prevent children from being exposed to inappropriate content at a young age, which could have a negative impact on their development.  For example, if a child picks up an @CAPS1 film and becomes interested in the content, they may be more likely to seek out similar materials as they reach puberty. This could lead to an early interest in sexual activity, which is not appropriate for their age. By sectioning off the @CAPS1 stuff, we can keep children away from such content and reduce the risk of them engaging in sexual activity at an early age.  As for music, it is difficult to completely prevent kids from listening to music with foul language or references to sex and drugs. Most of the music is available on online sites, and parents may not be aware of all the songs their children are buying, especially when they purchase them at home. With the internet available in many libraries, kids can easily plug in their devices and buy songs with offensive language or graphic material without anyone knowing. While it may not be possible to completely restrict access to such music, parents can play a role by not allowing their children to listen to it while they are with them.  In conclusion, my idea of sectioning off the @CAPS1 stuff in the library is a practical way to protect children from being exposed to inappropriate content. It allows for the freedom of access to these materials for adults while keeping them out of reach of children. Additionally, parents should take an active role in monitoring their children's media consumption to ensure that they are not exposed to harmful content.
414	3391	2	3	@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am strongly against using curse words. However, my brothers are influenced by the media to use such language. This raises the question: should we allow the media to include curse words in magazines and books? Or should items containing such content be removed from the library shelves?  Magazines are a popular source of entertainment and information, offering the latest gossip on interesting scandals. They appeal to a wide range of people around the world, most of whom are @DATE1 of age. Libraries often place magazines on the shelves to attract adult customers. However, many magazines today feature pictures of half-dressed women or men and explicit language on their covers. Is this the new norm that we should accept? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.  I love reading and believe that it is a more enriching activity than sitting on the couch and watching mind-numbing @CAPS2.V. However, the quality of some books has declined in recent years. Many books now contain curse words on almost every page or degrading scenes that are inappropriate for readers. In the past, books were a means of learning new things, exploring different cultures, and expanding our knowledge. But nowadays, it seems increasingly difficult to find a good book that lives up to the standards of the classics. It appears that we are replacing the beautiful and profound words of great authors with common and vulgar language. Allowing such books to be freely available on the library shelves is not right and should not be permitted.  With the prevalence of electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player, most music is now purchased directly from online sites. Many parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 are unaware of the songs their children are buying, especially when the purchases are made at home. In libraries with internet access, kids can easily plug in their devices and buy songs with offensive language or graphic content without anyone noticing. The question is, why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 librarians not put restrictions on these sites? The answer is that it is difficult to do so. Even if restrictions were put in place, kids would likely find a way to bypass them. Therefore, I believe that libraries should either remove the ability to download and purchase music or take steps to ensure that the music available is free from offensive language and graphic material.  In conclusion, the increasing presence of curse words, explicit content, and offensive language in magazines, books, and music is a concerning issue. We need to take action to protect the integrity of these media and ensure that they are suitable for all ages. By implementing stricter regulations and promoting the availability of high-quality, positive content, we can create a more healthy and respectful environment for everyone.
415	3392	2	3	Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship. Some people dislike books and movies with profanity in them, while others @MONTH1 have no issue with it. Similarly, some individuals enjoy scary mystery books and movies, but others @MONTH1 do not. I personally believe that all movies, music, and books should be acceptable, as long as they are consumed with the appropriate level of discernment.  I can understand why some people @MONTH1 advocate for the removal of certain movies or books from libraries. They may find the content inappropriate, but it's important to recognize that what is inappropriate to one person may not be to another. Many people appreciate books and movies with profanity because it can add a sense of realism and authenticity. However, there are also instances where the use of profanity may be excessive or gratuitous, and in such cases, it may be reasonable to question its inclusion.  Personally, I think that some magazines should no longer be produced. For example, @CAPS1 magazines are extremely offensive to me. They contain nothing but images of nude women, which I believe reflects a lack of self-respect on the part of the women involved. However, I acknowledge that others @MONTH1 view these magazines as creative and beautiful. It's not just magazines; movies are also increasingly advertising sex and drugs. This trend is concerning, as it can have a negative impact on the values and behavior of viewers, especially young people.  In conclusion, everyone has their own opinion on censorship, and it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences. If you are offended by a movie, music lyric, book, or magazine, the best course of action is to simply avoid it. At the same time, we should encourage a healthy discussion about the appropriate use of content in various forms of media and strive to find a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of vulnerable individuals.
416	3393	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone holds the same views as one another. What might be offensive to you, in a particular month, may be enjoyable to someone else. I personally firmly believe that nothing should be removed from a library. Just because something you might not like, someone else could really enjoy it. If you don't want to learn about something, you shouldn't take that opportunity away from others who do. I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves, they should still be accessible to those who want to view them. Even if you just store them away, it would be better than taking them out of the library completely. More and more books are being banned every day, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who won't get to enjoy the things the old generation has. So, I firmly believe that no books should be removed from libraries. If you don't believe in or enjoy something, it doesn't mean someone else won't. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse interests of all library users and keep the library a place where everyone can find something they love.
417	3394	2	3	What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions vary widely among the variety of different people across a specific location. Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but it has still been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a clear difference between vulgar and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library. A public library is a place where anyone from anywhere can come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is unique and has their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. that suits them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be straightforward. For consideration, maybe all public libraries should be divided into sections, each with its own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, Adult, and many more different titles. This setup is often used in well - known bookstores and libraries such as 'Barnes and Noble' and 'Borders' and 'Powell's'. Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as in school libraries. School libraries are a whole different concept. School libraries are designed to help assist the students' academic achievement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so - called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulgar items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up. The censorship in our libraries today varies from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision regarding which library they go to. If a family with young children wants to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, John Doe, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.' In conclusion, we should maintain the appropriate level of censorship for different types of libraries to ensure that everyone can access suitable materials.
418	3395	2	3	The author should be the one to judge whether or not they want their book censored. I firmly believe that libraries shouldn't have to take out books with offensive language. If the author likes how the book was originally made, then that's how they would like to present it. It would be taking away a right in the freedom of expression. If you were to write a book and somebody says you can't put a certain word, that isn't up to the public to decide. It's almost like rewriting history. It would be like having someone take out a word in the Declaration of Independence. If any word is changed, it is an incorrect Declaration of Independence. It just changes the entire subject. You cannot reword what has been written. Public views are starting to take over the world. Instead of letting the facts be the facts, people want to adjust things so it is less offensive. Next thing you know, there will be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing. If somebody switched that word, it could lead to it happening again. I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or don't read it. In conclusion, we should respect the author's right to express themselves and not let public opinion override the integrity of written works.
419	3396	2	3	First of all, do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? That question should never be asked in life. Why? Because there are many people out there who read and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. When I first saw this question, I answered to myself that, 'If all people think the same way, this world would be boring.' And I answered the question by saying that there should not be any books or music removed from any shelves because we all don't like the same thing or do the same thing. In the first place, I know that there are many different kinds of things that people do because they love doing it, and some don't do those kinds of things because they really don't like or don't care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article, the book, music, etc., says something or if it's offensive to other people. That is not a reason to remove stuff. There are things that you enjoy doing and things that you enjoy reading, listening, and looking at, etc., that other people don't like or hate. In the second place, just because you don't like something, people should not stop doing those things or stop buying those things. No! That is not the case here, America or the world. You should not care just for yourself or do whatever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future, don't just care about yourself; care about others too, because you'll need those people or those books in the future when you're falling down. In my conclusion, about this article, I think that people should not remove anything from any library even if it's found offensive to other people. Those things help others in life to do what they really want to do, while others are getting hurt by those offensive things that are written on a little piece of paper. I hope this letter helps you all think about and change your decision about this case. I hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general. In the end, we should respect the diversity of interests and keep libraries as inclusive spaces.
420	3397	2	3	One person's strong negative opinion affects everyone else. That doesn't seem logical or fair. A library is a sanctuary for people to go and read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres. There is a book for everyone in the library; it's just a matter of finding it. Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privilege away from everyone else. Books have a way of calming our minds, whether it's because it's an escape or measured by how enjoyable it is to read. Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader; some might even find the books relatable. For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there might be someone out there who would find this scene enjoyable because they can relate to it. People who aren't capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach. One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's. The book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for its quality, hence the numerous awards won. Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that the character was subjected to throughout her life. Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college - level reads for English Literature classes. It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style. If all readers were able to look past the surface among these scenes, less books would be contemplated on shelf removal. One person's negative interpretation of a novel affects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries. Readers are fully warned beforehand of the maturity of the contents. The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized (back - cover summary), and even sorted in a library. If one finds a book offensive, look in a different section. Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well; different genres appeal to different people. This applies to the maturity of the reader as well. Books are sorted according to what appeals to what age. If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger people, or a different genre completely. If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section. The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content, but how the interpretations differentiate towards such content. On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked. For one to complain about a book's contents automatically gives someone else the right to protect the book's contents. For libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights that our country has stood for. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse interpretations of books and not let one person's negative view limit everyone's access to literature.
421	3398	2	3	Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries is indeed a touchy subject. Many parents with young children firmly believe that certain books, with their potentially inappropriate content, should not find their way into libraries. On the other hand, there are those who hold the view that since it is a book, regardless of its nature, it should have a place in the library. After all, who knows, someone in @MONTH1 might need to write a detailed paper on that very 'touchy' book. Personally, I think that as long as a book is placed in a proper section, it should be accessible to a person of the right age. The libraries should clearly demarcate a specific area for children's books and another for adult or teenage - level reading materials. By doing so, there is a significantly lower likelihood that a young child will accidentally pick up a book meant for adults or teenagers. The library in the town where I live has a well - marked area for children and teenagers. This setup ensures that young children won't be rummaging through books with content that even many adults shouldn't read while looking for their favorite stories. If people are worried about someone being too young to read or view the material, the library can impose an age restriction on it. This way, those under the age limit won't be able to access the material, while those of the appropriate age can. Libraries are extremely important sources for study in many people's lives. If people didn't have a library, they in @MONTH1 wouldn't be able to research a paper or complete other tasks they need to finish. I feel that if people don't like the material in their local library, they should simply avoid looking at it or borrowing it. However, I firmly believe that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stumble upon a book with disturbing content. In my opinion, there should be a separate room for such materials where children have absolutely no access. This way, children can still visit the library without their parents fearing that they'll see something unsuitable. I feel that avid readers should be able to enter a library without worrying about encountering a book with material they consider inappropriate. Also, if I need to research a topic that others deem offensive, I should be able to do so. And if I were the author of a book labeled as 'bad,' I wouldn't want my book to be removed so that no one could read, study, or learn from it. I don't think censorship is something to be taken lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so authors of materials should have the same freedom. Parents and those who don't want to see such literature can take precautions. Total censorship, in my view, would prevent people from broadening their minds. If people just take precautions, there's no need for total censorship of materials that someone worked hard on for everyone to see.
422	3399	2	3	Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone didn't like it or finds it offensive. There are often groups of people genuinely interested in a book and may want to read it multiple times. They'll likely share their enthusiasm with others. Then, if just one or two students decide they don't like the book and find it offensive, and demand it be removed, I firmly believe it shouldn't be taken off the shelves. It would be a different scenario if everyone found the book offensive. But when it's just a few complainers, they shouldn't ruin the experience for everyone else. It's just a book, and students should understand that its presence doesn't mean it's directed at them. They should learn to overlook it. If you're playing music, dancing around, and having a great time, that's wonderful. However, if a song contains cussing, references to drugs, and such, it shouldn't be played in a school or around someone who in @MONTH1 might be religious or against that kind of content. They in @MONTH1 might not like it and assume you're into such things, and may even distance themselves from you. Show them respect and choose music that everyone can enjoy. So, if the library has this type of music, it should be carefully monitored to ensure only appropriate people check it out. Movies also require careful consideration. Movies already have ratings, which helps people determine if they're suitable for viewing. If you're borrowing movies from the library, it's reasonable to assume that an adult there has already screened them to ensure they're safe for students or children. I wouldn't want my little siblings watching something inappropriate. Magazines need to be monitored as well. You want a magazine that is both interesting and clean. Kids in @MONTH1 might not be able to distinguish between good and bad, and there are also teenagers to consider. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or references to drugs in magazines. If I walked into a library and saw such content in a magazine, I'd suggest removing it from the shelves. I'd do this to ensure kids have a healthy perspective on things. I don't want them getting ideas about doing bad things based on what they see in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety. Libraries in @MONTH1 always need advice. They need to be vigilant and make sure everything is clean and suitable for everyone to read, watch, or look at. I'm glad we have these safety measures for kids. I hope everyone pays attention to these things. I know that if I ever have children, I'd want them to be surrounded by things they can understand and that are appropriate for them.
423	3400	2	3	People Getting Offensive by Libraries. I think that libraries are sometimes offensive, but not all the time. It all depends on people's different beliefs and cultures. I can understand where some things in the library might be very offensive, while others aren't. I believe parents are more likely to be offended by things in the library because they don't want their kids to be exposed to content that isn't age - appropriate. Movies at the library in @MONTH1 might be offensive. For example, a parent might rent a movie for their child, thinking it's a kids' movie. When they get home and put in the @CAPS2, they find out it's actually an adult movie. Parents who don't want their kids to look at inappropriate things should keep an eye on their children and make sure they only stay in the children's area. If parents actually follow through with this, it could solve many problems. Some parents raise their children the way they want and teach them not to go into other areas unless given permission. I do get offended sometimes when I go to the library. There are some people who think it's funny to look at certain things just for amusement, not for any real purpose. They make a big deal out of it, and I don't like that because it makes the library seem like an unappealing place. If I were offended by something on the library shelf, I'd just pass it by and not pay attention. But some people will tell the library staff that a particular item on the shelf is offensive and bothers them. If I had an issue with the library for a certain reason, I'd complain. Complaining is likely to bring about a change. Instead of remaining silent, which won't solve the problem, I'd let them know how I feel about a particular product in the library in a calm and polite manner. When complaining, it's better to be nice because the person you're complaining to will likely respond in kind. I know that everyone doesn't have the same feelings about everything. But one thing is certain: we should keep living our lives and not let simple things in the library offend or bother us. If the library is a problem, you can stop going there, or you can ignore the offensive image. There are many ways to handle such situations. One important thing is to be respectful, and others will likely be respectful back. Your attitude matters a lot when telling someone that something is offensive. If you can't resolve the issue this way, then just move on.
424	3401	2	3	I do not think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed because they are offensive. There are indeed books, movies, and music that might offend some people. If we were to take all offensive materials away, we'd be left with nothing. There's no valid reason for such extreme measures. That's why I firmly believe we shouldn't remove offensive materials. First, if we removed all offensive materials from the shelves, they'd be empty. This would apply not only to libraries but also to movie stores and other places. If something like a book or movie offends you, I sympathize, but you should simply put it down and not worry about it. Second, I don't think we should remove offensive materials because of what they mean to us. They show us the contrast between good and bad, right and wrong, which is precisely what books and other forms of media are for. Books, movies, magazines, and such are important to the world, although to different extents for different people. You can't get angry at a book or a movie; instead, you should learn from them. For instance, if we did remove all offensive materials, what would that achieve? Would it make the world a better place? I don't think so. I believe we need such materials on earth to teach us how to be and to educate and inform us. In conclusion, I do not think offensive materials should be removed. If we did, libraries, movie stores, and book collections would be empty. We'd also be quite uninformed about life. So, we should keep offensive materials on the shelves.
425	3402	2	3	In the world, there are definitely some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media, including music, magazines, and movies, sets a certain standard for individuals in our society. I strongly disagree with the messages the media feeds our minds regarding our looks and lifestyle. The library is a place where most children go to fuel their imaginations with colorful, morally - sound books. It's also a haven for adults to relax and escape from work and life's responsibilities. Most children between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 develop a curious interest in the adult world and seek answers. However, the library isn't always as child - friendly as it should be. The library shelves are accessible to everyone, and a child can easily stumble upon content that could take away their innocence. Some parents in society think their neighborhood is a perfect, harm - free environment for raising children. But they don't realize that it's an uncensored world, and at any time, a child can become aware of inappropriate things. The media focuses on captivating our children. We need to be cautious about what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, a magazine featuring a girl who got a nose job because she thought her nose was too big can give an eight - year - old daughter the idea that she can have surgery to fix her nose, which the kids at school might tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that promotes violence, drug, and alcohol use. He might then think it's okay to pick fights at school or curse the teacher. Or a movie with a sex scene could give your child the wrong ideas. In our society, there shouldn't be an image that our children feel pressured to maintain. We should teach our children to explore life through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should nourish their kids' imaginations rather than their focus on image. Life for our children should be about having fun, gaining knowledge, and having positive life experiences, not being exposed to everything on the shelves of our local library.
426	3403	2	3	Have you ever been to a library? Have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library? I'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them.   Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with a wide array of books and other learning or reading material. Yes, this material is helpful in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. Stories such as steamy romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as inappropriate for some ages. These novels contain anything from brutal horror scenes, to explicit adult material, or foul language. Parents strongly argue that these books should be removed from the libraries.  I do not agree. I believe that such books and novels can be a great help to the imagination of others and get the mind flowing. Yes, I do agree that some novels are not age - appropriate for young children, but that doesn't mean that they should be removed. I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books, they should either go into the library with their child, closely guiding them, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from.  Another way of avoiding these writings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a specific spot in the library and allow only age - appropriate people inside. An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. An age younger could be inappropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to its full potential.  The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything. If anything, it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limits by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels. Sectioning off these novels in an age - appropriate area or having parental discretion will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects both the value of diverse literature and the need for age - appropriate access is the best way to handle this issue in libraries.
427	3404	2	3	In our libraries, there are a large number of books that are extremely helpful. There are also a wide variety of magazines, music, and movies. A lot of the movies are adult movies, but most libraries do have a dedicated kid section. Most of the books, magazines, and movies are easily reachable by little children. I have been to the library as a child and vividly remember seeing all the books there.  When I went to the library as a kid, I usually went with my parents. We would go there and mainly head straight to the kids section. I can also clearly remember going with my grandparents. I would either read books or put a puzzle together or engage in some other activity. I cannot recall a single time when I went to the library and saw something that was offensive.  I've never been to the library and seen anything that seems offensive to me. I'm sure that there is a book or a movie somewhere in every library that is offensive, but to give you an example of a personal experience is something that I cannot do. If the libraries do have books that are offensive, they do a really good job of hiding them from me and other kids. I haven't heard anything about people finding these kinds of offensive books in other books or magazines that I read.  I tend to not read very many books about the world. I have a strong preference for reading biographies about sports players and similar types of books. Whenever I read magazines, usually they are about sports or cars, so I don't read much about offensive things that might be going on, if they are.  If the libraries have offensive books, but no kids or people who shouldn't be reading them come across them, then the library doesn't need to remove them from the shelves. Some adults come into the library looking for one of these books, so then they can ask and find them. So, in my opinion, I think that the libraries shouldn't have to remove these books from the shelves. In conclusion, as long as proper measures are in place to prevent inappropriate access, there's no need to remove potentially offensive materials from libraries.
428	3405	2	3	We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inappropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, it's all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The books in libraries across the country that have profane ideas in them are one of the direct faults in our teenagers today.  In my personal experience with this, I have come across books that have had inappropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third - grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despicable it was. I've always been raised in a conservative home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries, I believe, is uncalled for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Racism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music have changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books.  In America, of course, we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of America in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is.  In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in America fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are.  In conclusion, while we need to balance the freedom of expression with the need to protect the younger generation, it's clear that a more cautious approach to the content in libraries is necessary. We should strive to create an environment that nurtures good morals and values in our youth, and carefully curating library materials is an important step in that direction.
429	3406	2	3	Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone somewhere. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.  Censorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are constantly being told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and cannot do. The same goes for being told what you can and cannot read. No one wants the truth cut out of their reading materials.  Censoring books could take away from learning. In school, children are required to read many different books in their English classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real - life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things, how will we learn that they exist.  The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can't go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter every time they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world, you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can't cut out people's offensive banter in real life, so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That amendment was created for a reason, to let Americans speak their beliefs.  Everywhere we look today, things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who might be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speak their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive criticism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of literature and the real - world experiences it can reflect, rather than resorting to unnecessary censorship.
430	3407	2	3	Books are important in the life of human beings whether they are for studies, entertainment, or any other use. On the other hand, there are some books that are offensive to readers. If certain books are offensive, should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether? With this being said, should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed.  Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others. This is the case in anything, for example, movies, books, and daily life. Some people might think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others, that is what makes the book interesting. For example, to show the full amount of hatred for a character, you have to use some offensive words. Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed; it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beaten, you have to describe just how brutal it was to satisfy some readers.  Another reason why books should not be removed is that people are taught when to tell that something is offensive. If a reader discovers a book is offensive, they should know to stop reading instead of finishing the book then complaining about offensive material. Also, if a person rents a movie and they know they aren't allowed to get an adult - rated movie, then they should get another movie. People should know not to get a book, read about the offensive stuff without stopping, and then go complain. If a person was concerned about a certain material, they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not.  Even if a certain material is offensive, it should not be removed. That is only the opinion of somebody. If the book was needed by somebody, they would not be able to get it because it was removed. If material were removed because someone said it was offensive, then there would never be any more books. For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad.  For those reasons, materials should not be removed. What if everybody started saying things were offensive? There would not be any more books. People should not have the complete say in the removal of books. Otherwise, people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material. So, do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? In conclusion, a consensus - based and rational approach is needed to handle potentially offensive library materials, rather than hasty removal based on individual opinions.
431	3408	2	3	Every parent has their own distinct opinion upon controversial topics like this. They often deliberate on what is best for their children's well - being. But even if you were to painstakingly censor out books, movies, music, etc., your child would still manage to find that book or movie on the vast expanse of the internet, completely uncensored. Yes, parents firmly believe that having things censored will safeguard their children from inappropriate content. However, children today have much more advanced technology at their fingertips and much easier access to uncensored music. As each day goes by, the minds of children become more and more curious as to what the world has to offer. The more parents try to keep their children away from certain aspects of life, the higher the chance is that their child might sneak out or turn out to be different from the person the parents had envisioned. Every person is an individual with their own thoughts and desires. I personally would say to just leave the books, music, movies, etc. on the shelves of libraries. Children will find out about these things anyways, whether it is from their friends or through the media. It's not to say that your child will become corrupt if listening to such music, but I believe that at a certain age, parents should have in - depth talks with their children about the things happening in the world. After all, children are not going to be children forever, and you will not be able to control them indefinitely. Everybody was a child at one point in time, and I am pretty sure that most parents very much disliked it when their own parents would keep them away from things they wanted to do or see. But life is not always fair, and these are just one person's opinions. Either way, if you decide to take all the music and censor it out or do the same to all the books and movies, etc., there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents. No matter what happens, odds are that children will find their way around these restrictions. It never fails. There will always be some way your child can get around you, always going to be some way your kids will get past your rules. Just think about it, if they disobey you once, they will most likely do it again. It is in a child's nature. So like I said before, every parent and every person has their own opinion upon topics like such. Me personally, I say just leave it and let the parents of these children handle it the way they would like to, because you can not please everybody.
432	3409	2	3	Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a specific view set aside for the reader or viewer at hand. They are created with a certain intention and message. If someone has a different view of the text, then they should not even be reading or viewing them. But to have great books be taken off of the shelves because they represent different views to someone else is truly unreasonable. People should give these things a fair chance because sometimes the non - original things just don't work. To have movies banned from the public because they are offensive is merely a way to control what we see and what we hear. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a valuable lesson about life without it really happening to someone. Books are a remarkable way that people can express themselves without actually going out and causing harm to someone or something. Poetry, for example, gives the reader a profound feeling of what the writer was experiencing when it was produced. Books that have political or social views on something should not be discriminated against because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the people. In novels, just because someone uses profanity does not mean that their message is any less clear. Their message might be that profanity is used too often or that the next generation below them might take a turn for the worst, but it is not used to harm. Music is a powerful way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song, it is not specifically aimed at one person; it is used to convey how bad they feel about what has happened to them, that they need something strong to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics might believe that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when it's just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words, and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express. In movies, you see someone get shot, brutally murdered or attacked, and it's already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violence shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what real - world dangers are out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severely injure another person, although that is how some people perceive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your vision; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something. To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are united or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something. Books, music and movies that are all based on something real should not be banned just because they show individuality; just because they have the decency to show us the truth amidst all the lies told to us by a higher authority. These people most likely believe that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one. So when people show the way things are, they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth. The censorship of only things that are truly vile should be censored, not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the communities are today.
433	3410	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves, whether in libraries or any other place. I believe that if someone wants to know more information about something, the library or other relevant institutions should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the libraries and other similar places started putting these materials away. Many people wouldn't bother to go there. In my eyes, the library is a place that shows us where we have been, what we have been through, and the things we have accomplished. Could you imagine walking around a library and seeing nothing about your past? No, I couldn't. Even though things might seem offensive in one person's eyes, it could be the history of another. Many people these days rely on the usage of magazines, books, and music to get information. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has happened in their past to understand how they got to their future. So taking away information that might seem offensive to someone else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in libraries, museums, art shows because everything has its own history behind it. And if we just cover it up, we will never know. I myself would rather want to know than not to ever have known. After all, knowledge, no matter how uncomfortable it might be, is an essential part of our growth and understanding of the world.
434	3411	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from public libraries. Consider this: what if a young, innocent child were to stumble across an inappropriate magazine? They would have the disturbing images stuck in their heads, and it could potentially lead to unlawful decisions in the future. There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young - aged children. I think that they should either be placed more appropriately or removed completely. Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others, but if read or watched, the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts. Personally, I think that most fictional books are mainly for entertainment. They do not, for the most part, display actual happenings or thoughts. If someone reads them as offensive, they might just be taking it the wrong way. Most libraries have areas sectioned off for adults only, but these areas aren't adequately monitored. So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material? They wouldn't have the slightest clue. I think that in today's society, most children already know about sexual graphics and such, so why limit them to what they already know about? There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic than books and magazines. Shouldn't they be banned too? The world is exposed to offensive material every day. We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way. But young children don't know better, so there is no guarantee that they won't take ideas from inappropriate viewings and use them. So maybe things do need to be taken off shelves to protect the innocent minds of children.
435	3412	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries. When entering a library, you know you are going to find something interesting to read, listen to, or even watch. Most people use libraries to find information on a certain topic, and some of these topics are not always appropriate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the library and look to find books that interest them. Sometimes, they come across books about stuff they shouldn't know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on their shelves that they please, but it should be restricted to certain age groups. Suppose you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing. You might have passed by many books about racism. As a little kid, you might not know what that is, but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading about NASCAR to reading about racism and different races. I believe that books should be kept in order of age. When a teenager goes into the library to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on their topic. In most libraries, there are topics such as sex, killing, and violent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it. If I am at the library, I will always look for a book that interests me. My skills on choosing books for myself have changed since I was 8 or 9. Now that I'm older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at our hometown library and saw a 10 - year - old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day, I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. When I saw this, I was surprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have, but in certain age sections. Kids visit the library all the time and are looking for books to strike their interest. They will always find something different that they should not be exposed to. Libraries would have trouble containing what kids read, so they should expose all the different topics in an age - appropriate way. When you're little and reading about these topics, you will then be more informed when you're just a little older. Next time when you visit the library, check and see what kids in your local town are talking and reading about. You will be surprised when a child approaches his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraries should expose what they want as long as they want to ensure knowledge to everyone in an appropriate and safe manner.
436	3413	2	3	I don't think nothing should be taking off the shelves at the libraries. If a book, magazine, or other educational material can offer valuable knowledge and lessons to your child in a certain way, it should stay. Children can learn a great deal from the diverse collection of books at the libraries. These books cover a wide range of topics, from history and science to literature and art. If you need help or answers about certain things, you can always find what you are looking for in a library. They house an extensive repository of information, and they have all the answers you might seek. You can not get everything off the internet; some in - depth and reliable information you have to look up by opening a book. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school projects and studies at the library. It was a place of discovery and learning. There are so many things at the libraries that are educational. You just have to know what you are looking for and take the time to explore. For some of these adults, if you were having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, it doesn't mean the same for your child. Sometimes your children have a better time understanding and grasping concepts than you did at their age. Parents, please don't take away the good things out of the libraries that could really help your child at times. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start. There are things that you would be better off finding in a book because not everything is on the internet. So many scientists found their information in a book because it's easier to trust and reference. You learn so many good things from a library. The books and materials in a library help you with so much research. Taking materials out of a library, I would have to disagree. Libraries are a valuable resource for everyone, and we should preserve their collections.
437	3414	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. There are multiple compelling reasons to back up this statement, including an accurate and thought - provoking quote from author Katherine Paterson. People build their character through their reactions to how others treat them. For example, in life, somebody might offend another person, but that does not mean the offender is going to disappear after doing so. How does this relate to libraries, you might ask? Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive. It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch. Just because you may have the option of checking out something you do not think is appropriate or is offensive, does not mean you have to check it out. Some people actually enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive as it challenges their perspectives. You may be wanting to argue, 'But I don't want my children being exposed to such offensive materials.' That is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections. If you happen to come across an offensive book in the children's section, then do not let your child check that out. It is as simple as that. Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time and energy. The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf. She is saying that if one person is allowed to remove a book, then anybody else would be able to have that ability as well. Therefore, a book that may not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it. Eventually, there would be no books left. In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out. You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else may want to check them out. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the freedom of choice in libraries.
438	3415	2	3	No, I do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks it's offensive. Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read. Tastes in literature vary widely, from adventure and romance to mystery and science - fiction. I think that if you don't like the book and think it's offensive, that you shouldn't get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it. Not everyone likes the same books, but every book in a library is there for a reason. The library screens all of the books that they get in and wouldn't buy something if no one asked for it or if it wasn't a good book to have. They consider the interests and needs of their patrons. I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it. Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoying the books that they have an interest in? If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive, there wouldn't be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read. I also think that if you don't like the selection of books on the shelf, that you shouldn't be looking in that section. Go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read. There's something for everyone in a library, whether it's classic literature, modern best - sellers, or specialized research materials. This is why I think it's not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves. No one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive'. Libraries are meant to be a place of open access and diverse reading options.
439	3416	2	3	I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken off the library shelves and just be put in book stores for one's own usage. These might be books with extremely explicit content that is not suitable for a general library environment. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about, like history books talking about wars, slavery, and books with curse words in them. These books are important for understanding the past and different aspects of society. School libraries, such as the elementary and high school libraries, should have books according to their age groups. If the librarian knows the book is not something a young kid should read, then they shouldn't let them check it out. The music, magazines, and movies should also be age - appropriate for the age groups. Little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song. It can have a negative impact on their language development and values. Movies should be age - appropriate too. That's why libraries have sections for babies, toddlers, pre - teens, teens, and adults. So if you're really concerned that your child or even just yourself are going to find an offensive book or one that's not good for the age group, then stay in your own section. Let's say you're a teen and there's a book that is not right for you to read and is for more older people. Then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section. Every person feels differently about what's offensive and not offensive though. So libraries shouldn't have to take out every book that offends one person because it's not fair to the rest of the people. Besides, no one's making you check out that book. We should respect the library's role in providing a balanced and diverse collection for all patrons.
440	3417	2	3	Hey, what book is that? Let me see it because I don't think I want you to read it because it is too graphic for a [NUM1] - year - old boy. This is what some parents might say to their child if they don't want them to read a certain kind of book or even a certain book. I feel that censorship is not needed in libraries because either way, the kids will be exposed to something the parents don't want them to see sooner or later. In today's world, information is everywhere. I do not believe that any one has the right to remove anything from the shelves except the library staff. They can go ahead and complain that they don't want it there. But if the library has it, the library should be able to keep it there whether or not people don't want it there. I think the only real people that can remove a book from the shelves are the managers or manager if they agree with the patron. Other than those certain people, I don't think a regular person can remove anything from the shelves. At the library I go to, they have any kind of book, music, movie, and magazine you want. Whether it is an adult - content book to a rated R movie, they have anything and they get new things every week. So if a person does not want a certain thing on the shelves, they should not be able to by themselves take it from the shelves because what if another person wants to see the movie but they can't because a parent took it from the shelf because they did not want their kid being exposed to it. One time at my library, I saw a verbal fight between a patron and the library manager. The patron did not want the book in the section it was in because they felt it was too provocative for a children's book. The manager refused to take it off the shelf because the library can have whatever books they want on their shelves. Another time, I saw a person break a DVD because they thought children at the age their children were should not be allowed to see those kinds of movies. But breaking the movie is just putting other people who want to see it at a disadvantage because now they can't because it is broken. To summarize everything, I do not think citizens should be allowed to remove anything from the shelves. Only the managers of the library should be able to remove anything if they want, based on proper considerations and policies. This way, the library can maintain its role as a public and inclusive resource.
441	3418	2	3	Expanded Item 1 Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,  I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young children who will pick up a book, movie, or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We don't need younger children reading off whatever they know what to say. It's already bad enough that they hear offensive language from family members or people near them. The seller could also make an edited version of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine.  The sayings, 'You don't like it, then don't look.', 'Don't got anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all.', and 'If you wouldn't want to hear it, then don't say it.', strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, it seems like they don't really mind who sees their product, as long as people are buying their product.  Nowadays, it seems like the younger the child is, the smarter they'll be. If a four - year - old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case, it doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, 'It's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did it. Why can't I?'. Children learn more things from family and friends, before they start learning the truth in school.  It's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, where half - naked to naked women are just walking around freely. Not something a little five - year - old needs to see. Just like a little five - year - old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vain.  Having young children see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think it's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think it's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seems like a huge wake - up call to some parents, but it's not normal. It's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/near children.  Every parent wants the best for their child. They don't want their children growing up in a world that is full of bad, nor do they want their children doing wrong. By letting companies sell their product with half - naked people on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murdering someone, hiding the body, and praying to @CAPS12 that they don't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, it lets them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music wherever they want, and makes the companies win.  I'm not a mother, nor am I soon - to - be - a - mother, but I find it highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. I wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine and asking me questions about the nearly naked people, or have them ask me what a word means when it's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.  As well, I strongly do believe in 'freedom of speech', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product as it is. Just, if they really wanted to sell their product that much, that bad, then they should sell it online. It might cost more, but at least everyone would know that their children wouldn't see it. Although, once you own it, then it's the buyer's fault if their child saw it. That would be on the parents' plate to deal with.  Another thing with children is that their brain is still developing at that young age. Their imagination is beyond the fairy - tale world; it's kinda like their second home, only it's inside their brain. Their brain is still developing and learning new things each and every day. Once they go to the store with their parent(s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoes, or just because they wanna run up and down the aisles. It's bad enough having them see something inappropriate.  I know I wouldn't let my children see things like those, and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your children seeing those things. So, for the children's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developing brains and their off - the - wall imagination. Treat the children how you were treated growing up.  Thank You, @PERSON2.
442	3419	2	3	Expanded Item 2 I myself think that all books should be off the shelves because I do find some books to be offensive in their contents. I also find it very annoying when people have books and you are trying to talk to them, but all they do is ignore you and keep reading. I find that disrespectful.  Myself, though I do not like reading. I find it to be boring and sometimes tiring unless it is actually a good book. I also could say that some movies should be taken off shelves because they are so stupid and have no point, such as Harry Potter, Twilight, and most other books that have mythical creatures in them.  Music, on the other hand, should not be taken off because it is a lot easier to relate to and understand. I might be wrong, but that's my personal opinion of the whole ordeal. Some music in the lyrics can show who you are and what you stand for in life. Music shows character and is easier to follow than movies or a boring old book.  I listen to music all the time. You hardly ever see me with a book in my hands. I sometimes do watch movies, but they are more action - packed and comical. Though I really don't like scary movies. I do watch some, but I don't like ones with weird - looking creatures in it. That's just not what I look for in a movie.  I can list some books, movies, and music I like. For instance, two books I like are 'Blood is Thicker' and 'Until We Meet Again' by @PERSON3. Movies I like are all five of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movies, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4 The @PERSON4, and my all - time favorite @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and the new Karate Kid. Music I listen to consists of @CAPS8 - @CAPS9, @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON2, @PERSON5, @LOCATION3, @CAPS10 - @CAPS11, @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @ORGANIZATION5, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, and @PERSON1. They are all great singer - songwriters and do a great job at what they do and make millions off of it. I mean, come on, people love music more than anything. There are more movie music albums sold in the world than there are books and movies combined, which I really think proves a big point when I say music is better. Surveys have been taken, and music wins every time.  So, therefore, this concludes my opinion on this subject, and I hope I voiced it good enough to prove my point to people in the world that say books and movies are better because they're not.
443	3420	2	3	Expanded Item 3 Sometimes I think it's always good to have appropriate material on the shelves of stores or a library. I feel this way because when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy it. Or maybe when you've been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive because it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up.  My views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials because they can entertain adults and teenagers. All of these materials - music, magazines, books, and movies - can entertain them because of the inappropriate sayings. It seems to give people a boost up their style and ways to act, such as music being the number one offensive material. Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and start to feel that inappropriate vibe.  Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. Movies and television. When we watch a movie that is offensive and that can be very inappropriate, you learn from what's in the movie. Most people make movies that can teach lessons if you're willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. That's one of my main reasons I think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. Television is basically the same as movies. You can learn a lot from an offensive @CAPS1 show. You can learn what and what not to do.  Also, my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials when it comes to what we read, like books. Books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. People seem to read books because of the categories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of people's lives - rough, lovely, funny, and full of drama. We tend to read these offensive books because of what some of us have been through as a kid or just would like to read it because we wanna maybe feel the same sympathy that someone else might have had. Also, books can be advice - giving on what people want to do in life, careers that you might be interested in.  Last but not least, on my views on censorship regarding offensive materials like magazines. Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. I go against the reason of magazines being on the shelf because there's a lot of gossip. I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. Also, because of the false information. The false information that they give is what we wanna buy. But for the most part of my opinion, I believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up.  I believe the offensive materials - music, movies, books, and somewhat of magazines - should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. They all catch eyes for gossip, provocative ads.   In conclusion, while these offensive materials have their drawbacks, the fact that they are popular among consumers shows that there is a demand for them. However, steps should be taken to ensure that the most inappropriate aspects, like the false information in magazines, are rectified.
444	3421	2	3	Expanded Item 4 @PERSON1, an author, once said; 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, she was proving the fact that books should not be censored in any form of way, in which I take the affirmative side on.  To begin with, censorship is simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive. An example of this would be the society in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2. In this book, @PERSON3, the main character and eventually the protagonist, is a firefighter that causes fires instead of putting them out. The government believes that books are dangerous because they cause people to become knowledgeable. So as a result, they order people to burn them, making society ignorant and a potential 'slave' to their government. Despite losing his job and almost being killed by the government, @PERSON3 rises to understand that books have true meaning and that what the government is doing is wrong.  This topic now poses a question: 'Is all censorship bad?' Of course not. Some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact. For example, any form of media whether it is books or magazines that portrays hatred toward a certain religion or group should be censored by the government because according to our constitution, people have the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also known as 'freedom of speech'). However, the majority of censorship does not take a good side. In the political world today, censorship is applied to people who speak out against their government or leader due to the fact that they had been dishonest or ruthless to the people. Even in our country today, the government applies this which in some cases violates the constitution because people have the freedom of speech, but to a certain extent only.  Overall, the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes. Censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it is wrong. On the other hand, censorship towards things that portray hatred is not bad either. In conclusion, bad censorship causes people to become uneducated, at the end resulting in pure ignorance. This is why we need to be very careful when implementing censorship and ensure that it is used only in the most necessary and justifiable cases.
445	3422	2	3	Expanded Item 5 I find it interesting that people think that it's their problem to go to the book - shelf and say this and that shouldn't be allowed here. I also feel that if you don't like the book, don't look at it or read it. I mean, I kind of understand about the magazines because sometimes they can be pretty bad. I mean, at the same time, it's no one's job to say what is right and what is wrong.  The music, I am @PERCENT1 in agreement with it being taken out of the libraries. Some of the music people listen to today
446	3423	2	3	'Should libraries censor reading material for students at school?' That is a yes and no question because reading is beneficial for people of all ages. It's just a matter of whether the topic is suitable for certain age groups. Yes, I do think they should censor reading material, but to an extent. They need to have books tailored for kids at specific age groups. For instance, have distinct sections for young kids, then teens, and then adults. If a child wants to read more graphic material, they must have permission from their parent. The reason I say that is there are things that get published by authors that are meant to be read by certain people. In conclusion, striking the right balance in providing age - appropriate reading materials while allowing room for parental guidance is the key to a functional and beneficial library system for students.
447	3424	2	3	Regardless of if we are speaking of the religious demanding books such as the Harry Potter series to be ripped from our shelves or some group wanting to burn the Quran, books can always bring about controversy. In this country, we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals, and values, so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily by putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies, and magazines are no different; all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so. There are lists of hundreds of banned books, and honestly, you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writer's words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all. And if you have to ban the words, then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this, then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless. Without a voice, there is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion, then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours, and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future. Imagine the impact if the Catholic Church had locked away every copy of the Bible because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of Shakespeare or Plato. It would be a world far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place. While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading 'Playboy', they definitely should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering, and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music may have lyrics that some would consider rude, but to another, they may speak a message. To a creationist, Darwin's views may seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist, they may be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own. We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads; we should be able to develop our own through an exploration of those of others. Censorship is wrong; our government has no business in what we choose to explore, and no one should be restricted by the views of another. In conclusion, a world without censorship allows for the free flow of ideas, which is essential for the progress and development of society.
448	3425	2	3	I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what you're picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off the shelves of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyone's opportunity of maybe finding what they were looking for. Censorship in libraries is just unneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children, on the other hand, should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they don't pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child. Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some, it may be pictures. For others, it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just cannot be avoided. So why take it out of libraries? If it's really offensive in any way, put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book may contain material that may offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectedly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that may enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them. Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what you're picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that may enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries? It's not accomplishing anything. In conclusion, libraries should provide a free - choice environment with appropriate guidance for children, rather than implementing unnecessary censorship.
449	3426	2	3	I think that we should censor things our children read and look at in the libraries. They have young eyes and are too young to be looking at that stuff. They would be taught the wrong thing at a very young age. They would grow up the wrong way. We need to take a stand on what our kids look at. For the future, we need censorship. Children are in a stage of rapid development, and their minds are highly impressionable. Exposure to inappropriate content in libraries can have a long - term negative impact on their values and behavior. By censoring reading materials, we can ensure that they are exposed to positive and age - appropriate information. Parents and librarians should work together to create a safe and healthy reading environment for children. Please everyone take a stand. In conclusion, censorship in libraries for children is a necessary measure to safeguard their proper growth and development.
450	3427	2	3	Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves? No, we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it from your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be. I like Maxim magazines. Magazines like Maxim Hot 100, or Sports Illustrated. If there is a bad picture or anything in it and they take it off, my perspective is that if you don't like what you see, then put the book, magazine, or whatever it might be back. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you? I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like Sports Illustrated. Just non - hurtful things. All it took was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. Maxim fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem? The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if you're a very religious person, then yes, I understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful. Finally, I just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean someone else won't. You wouldn't want it to happen to you. In conclusion, removing items from library shelves based on individual preferences is unfair and limits the choices of others. We should respect each other's interests and allow for a diverse range of materials in libraries.
451	3428	2	3	First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism over the course of history. From the autocratic regime of @LOCATION1, where individual freedoms were severely restricted, to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire, which stifled intellectual growth. It always unfolds as a terror that descends violently. Farenheit @NUM1 was written by @PERSON1 in the mid - twentieth century, foreshadowing a wicked future if censorship is imposed on humanity. The human population will no longer possess actual knowledge, only what they have been officially told. In this book, the population is strictly forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely fabricated by the government, leading them into a state of psychological madness. As if propaganda doesn't already warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the final blow. Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be removed from the shelf. Eventually, they all will start disappearing until there are none left. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the government is righteous, when in fact, the malignant being is the government itself. This all brings up one of the world's greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lives that these things are unacceptable, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it. I, without the slightest hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they wish to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lives. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes being taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies. A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we don't, censorship will come, and no one will have the right to believe in what they want. It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest. What will become of the uncertain future? Only by standing firm against censorship can we hope for a future where knowledge and freedom thrive.
452	3429	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if it is found to be offensive. In libraries, people often fight over a single book. This clearly indicates that libraries need to have more than one copy of a book. If the library doesn't have multiple copies of a book, it will create a lot of problems for everyone. People in the library fight over a single book. I think whoever gets there first should get the book, but that's just my opinion. If two people fight over a book, they should be kicked out of the library and never allowed to return. This is precisely why we have fights over books. The next time you are in a library, think first before you act. Ask yourself, '@CAPS3 they get there before me?' The library should have more than one copy of a book. Let's say the '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book series is in the library, and they have only one of each book. Now, the last movie of '@ORGANIZATION1' is coming out this @DATE2 (@DATE1), and people want the last book to read. The kids especially want it, but there is only one book. So, what do you do? You should get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy. If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book, it will create a lot of problems. If they have only one copy of a book, it will lead to fights. You don't want to have fights in a library (look @CAPS4 @NUM1). Now, if it were me, I would let someone have it if they really wanted it. So, libraries need more than one copy. In conclusion, I think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if found offensive. There is too much fighting over books, and you don't want that. The libraries need more than one copy of a book so that people will not fight over it. If the libraries don't have copies of a book, it will create problems. So, think before you act. Books can be found offensive at times, and it's important to handle such situations appropriately.
453	3430	2	3	What do you consider an offensive book? Everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive. So, how can you justify that a book, magazine, movie, music, etc. should be removed from a shelf due to its content? Of course, there are the ones that most people would agree are offensive to young kids and even some adults, but then again, other people don't find the same things offensive. The items that do contain graphic content, cursing, etc. and do offend most people should be set aside and placed in a different shelving area away from the others. This way, those who are easily offended can avoid them, while others still have access. So, honestly, no one can say that a certain book(s), music, movie(s), magazine(s), etc. do not have a right to have a place on a shelf and should or shouldn't be removed. If parents don't want their children or teenagers looking or seeing certain material, that is something that the parents need to take into their own hands, not a library or anywhere else. Now, if this is an item at the home of a parent and they don't want their kids to see it, they have every right to remove it from the shelf. Then again, if their child or teen finds this item and looks at it and the parents didn't want them to, they shouldn't have bought it in the first place, or they should have removed the item more securely. So, can you as a stranger justify whether or not something is offensive and a parent shouldn't let their kid look at it, or that a library or store shouldn't have that item on the shelf? No, you can't. If you don't want your children to see it, you should set standards and rules. In the end, it's a complex issue, but personal responsibility and individual choice should play a major role in determining what is and isn't appropriate for each person.
454	3431	2	3	Every book has a meaning or message that all should know about. Taking a book away from a library shelf can decrease the knowledge available to someone who might need that information. Just because a book may have certain views that can be offensive does not mean it should not be allowed on a shelf. A book should not be discriminated against based on what the contents may have from the perspective of a reader. Positive and negative books should all be allowed on the shelves for anyone who has an interest. As for music and movies, which can be placed in the same category, it can be reasonable to have some limitations. It's really not that necessary to have them in a library because it's a place known for peace, quiet, and relaxation. If music or movies become a distraction or a hazard, then they should not be welcome in the library. On the positive side, music and movies can have a way of comforting some people while they have a good book at hand. It is understandable to have a little bit of variety along with the knowledge within the pages of a book. Magazine is another non - necessary object that is often placed in the library. A magazine can have a mixture of good and negative things in it. Not all magazines have something that can be used to educate. Most magazines are known for entertainment and updates on well - known people around the globe. Magazines should be removed from the library. The library should be an experience of a learning environment and only materials that will be a good help rather than for entertainment for pleasure. Removing a book from a shelf is like reducing the knowledge that could have been gained. As such, removing books should not be allowed no matter how or what the content of the book may be. As for music, movies, and magazines, there should be a limit on their usage in the library. By maintaining this balance, the library can better serve its purpose as a place of learning and knowledge.
455	3432	2	3	@CAPS1 Should be Taken off the @CAPS2' @CAPS1 should be taken off the shelves? Nothing. At least, that's what I think. For any book, you can find some bad thing about it. People cannot keep bad things away from kids; it doesn't work that way. Whether it is cursing, sex, gore, racism, teens will find them, and I think it would be better if they were found in a book instead of real life. Most young adult books have cursing. There is no way around it. Teens hear cursing every day, at home, school, or even at work. And yes, it is offensive, but there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is there and part of our life. Most adults think that if they don't shelter teens, then they will find all this bad stuff in music. What adults don't understand is that teens do whatever they want to be happy. The music of today is very offensive, but they love it! That is what is 'hot' in the music world right now. Ok, say a kid was from a run - down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't approve of. That pop music would make the kid happy. Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive? Sex, a lot of really good books have sex in them, but if a kid is at home reading about sex, then he or she is not out doing it. Plus, sex makes books better. I read books that contain rape and other sexual acts, but I've never done it, only read about it. Race is another big deal. 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6' is an amazing book, and every kid should read it so they can learn. That is the whole point in reading, so you can learn. We need to learn about those kinds of things. Keeping us sheltered is not going to protect us; it only makes us want whatever we can't have even more. Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn; don't take that away from us. If we don't like it, we will not read it or listen to it. Don't choose for us; let us learn on our own. It is our life. Let us make our own mistakes. By allowing us access to a wide range of materials, we can develop the ability to think critically and make our own informed decisions.
456	3433	2	3	Libraries, although not favored by a few, are well - liked by most people. Libraries can be found in almost every town. People enjoy visiting them to read books, use the computers, and engage in family activities. However, there are certain things that some people would like to do at the library but are restricted due to their age or because the activities are prohibited. Do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone? Most people believe that one doesn't always have to go to the library. If you're irresponsible and damage the checked - out items or return them extremely late, the fine could be as much as the cost of buying the item. But if you're responsible, there's no issue. Some also think that if the library won't let anyone touch or check out an item, it should be removed. There will always be someone who wants that item, and it's impolite for a librarian to say no. Libraries should maintain the traditional setup: a kids' section with children's books, a section for middle - schoolers and teenagers, and a section for high - schoolers and adults. This way, things will run smoothly. The goal is to make the public library fair for everyone in the town. Now that some facts and opinions have been stated, hopefully, libraries and librarians will consider what to put on the shelves of a public library to ensure fairness for all. So, do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone?
457	3434	2	3	"Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1, I'm writing this letter to your newspaper company because, just like Katherine Paterson, I feel strongly that we should not have certain books @NUM2, and any sexual books in public libraries. These types of books can have a lasting negative impact on a child's mind. In my opinion, any books containing such content should not be on the shelves of public libraries. Additionally, we should have more censorship in books with inappropriate language as it can change a person's way of thinking. Let me give you an example. Suppose a little boy asks a librarian where the action books are. The librarian might say, ""Aren't you a bit too young to be reading those books?"" And the child could reply, ""No, I heard this was a really good book, and my big brother said it was great too."" This simple interaction shows the potential issues. In conclusion, I firmly believe that these inappropriate books should be removed from public library shelves for the well - being of all readers. Sincerely, your customer @PERSON2."
458	3435	2	3	"This statement is not right. People should be allowed to read, listen to, or watch whatever they want. When someone reads something that's considered ""bad,"" they might @MONTH1 or simply not like it. So, people should not remove books, movies, and music that are deemed inappropriate. People should have the choice of what they read and engage with. Some people enjoy reading ""bad"" stuff in books because they find it entertaining. If they don't like it, they can put the book back and find something else. Movies are a lot of fun to watch. When watching a new movie, it's advisable to rent it first to see if you can tolerate the offensive scenes. And if you're too young, you should watch a movie with an adult. Music that is considered offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's bad for everyone. There's one thing that can be removed from the shelves, and that's magazines. Reading certain types of magazines can be harmful. If people want them, they should order them offline and have them mailed to their homes. In conclusion, books, movies, and music should stay on the shelves, but magazines of a certain nature can be removed. People like the content that some might consider ""bad,"" and there's no need to take these items off the shelves. That's my stance on this matter."
459	3436	2	3	I think that books, music, movies, and magazines should not have to be removed from the shelves of libraries. People find entertainment in movies with sexual or violent activity. I believe that if we remove all items with offensive content from the shelves, some people will be disappointed. In today's generation, people look forward to seeing things they can't see at home with their parents. Music these days often contains a lot of bad language, but that's what makes it appealing to many. The same goes for movies. Books, music, and movies today often discuss sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement. This kind of content grabs our attention and piques our interest. If you have a child or a family member you don't want exposed to offensive material, don't let them access it. Most stores with offensive items have a back - room where they keep such things, so others don't have to see them. People may take offense sometimes, but that doesn't mean libraries should remove these items from their shelves. People can make their own decisions about what they want to listen to, watch, or read. Everyone has their own preferences and opinions. I think libraries will have more business if they keep the offensive items on the shelves. Younger people are more interested in things that seem like a dream or are very unreal. In conclusion, libraries should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines on the shelves because we have the freedom to choose what we want to engage with. If you don't want to see or listen to such things, don't look for them at the libraries.
460	3437	2	3	If you get offended because of a book, magazine, music, or movies, then simply don't read, watch, or listen to it. America shouldn't be subject to censorship. Censorship should be reserved for young children. If you're an adult and get offended by something with the '@CAPS1 - word' in it, then avoid reading it. If a movie has offensive language, then don't watch it. I completely disagree with the idea of removing vulgar words. I'm not offended by swearing because it's often used in a humorous way, like in jokes, or it can make an otherwise mediocre song more interesting. Censorship can be helpful, but vulgar things shouldn't be removed from society, and they never will be. More often than not, kids learn cuss words from parents or friends. If you don't want your kid to cuss or be around cussing, then remove them from that environment. It's the parents' responsibility to protect or 'censor' a child's surroundings. In conclusion, while we should be aware of the impact of vulgar content on children, we should not over - censor society as a whole, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they are exposed to.
461	3438	2	3	The books in the libraries that I have read so far don't seem like they would be offensive to anyone. I haven't really listened to the music in the libraries or watched the movies, and the magazines seem fine too. That doesn't mean that there isn't any material that can be offensive to other people. But if there is, then I think that they should take them out of the libraries. However, I think if someone found something like that, they would probably just put it back and not go there again.   If they took out every book, music, movie, and magazine that people thought were offensive, then I bet a lot of them would be removed, and that wouldn't be fair to other people. Maybe they want to read, listen to, or watch them, and they would be really mad if they found out they were taken out because other people thought they were offensive. Some people would probably understand that some of those materials could hurt someone's feelings or be offensive to others, but then there are other ones that don't care.   I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad. I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and getting their feelings hurt or anything. But if they're not that bad, then I don't think they should be removed, and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in the libraries. If there are ones that are really bad and they stay in the libraries, then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries, and sooner or later, less and less people would stop going.   So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people who keep going to the libraries. A lot of people enjoy reading, and that's what they do for fun. They would be really upset if they couldn't go anymore over something that stupid. In the end, maintaining a balance in library content is crucial to ensure everyone can have a positive and inclusive experience.
462	3439	2	3	I think that most books, magazines, or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are okay. Many people need to read them and see what they are about. I think people take offense at little things such as curse words, or if the book or magazine is talking about drugs.   I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it. Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is. I have read many books that have inappropriate words in them.   I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great, and when I started reading it, it had a lot of curse words in it. I guess that's just how it is nowadays. You honestly cannot find a book without at least one bad word in it. People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials.   I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves. It could be interesting to someone else but not you. Many people have different opinions about different kinds of things, and I think it should just be left up to that person whether or not they read, listen to, or even look at certain kinds of reading material. In conclusion, respecting individual choices and the diversity of reading materials is essential for a well - rounded literary environment.
463	3440	2	3	Should taking books, music, and movies off the shelves of libraries even be questioned? As stated in our constitution, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury ever since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also, people have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off the shelves is completely out of the question.  In the Constitution, it states that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including the freedom to information. Due to this reason, places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on their shelves. Even if some of the content is inappropriate, it still serves a way to educate. For children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read, and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken off the shelves, we would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines can be beneficial to some and offensive to others. However, for those who would find this beneficial, do we want to simply go against our Constitution and deprive them of that information?  Another topic in the Constitution is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelf, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell their kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that may seem inappropriate to some aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelf. However, some people may come across a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on a child who is not supposed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information; all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.  As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example, I was restricted from watching rated R movies or things with inappropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood, I did this, and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do whatever they would like, and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privilege to view them.  In conclusion, removing materials such as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before, doing something like this would be going against our Constitution. The answer to solving this problem to me is clear - children should just not pick up those types of materials, and that's the end of the case. Upholding the principles of the Constitution in library content management is vital for a free and informed society.
464	3441	2	3	The library has many books; they would have anything that you could possibly imagine. The library is a great resource for any information. They have so much information that if you were to go to the library, you would be there all day. Libraries carry many different kinds of books. They would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats. There are libraries all around us, and they are very convenient.  If a library carried misleading books, music, movies, or even magazines, I would have to say that they could get in a lot of trouble. Especially if a magazine, a movie, or any other source of information would show anything that would offend someone in any way, then someone should tell the librarian or the manager and say this should not be on the shelf. When people go to the library, they are expecting clean reviews about the library.  If a library were meant to carry offensive products, it would not be called the library. The library is meant to be a quiet place where someone could go there and browse around maybe, or just go in and get what they need and come right on out. Most libraries are pretty particular about what they should or should not put out on their shelves. If someone put something way out of the ordinary, and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf, they should automatically be fired.  In conclusion, libraries are very useful and important to the town or city. The only thing would be to keep an eye out for any offensive books, music, and so on. You never know when they will be randomly out on the shelf, and if you happen to find one, you should immediately tell the librarian or the library's manager. The library may get in trouble, and then again, they may not. Overall, a vigilant approach to library content is necessary to maintain its positive and appropriate image.
465	3442	2	3	DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES, MAGAZINES, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE? I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO. THE REASON WHY I STATE THIS IS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BOOKS THAT HELP YOU THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE. THERE ARE RUDE AND HORRIBLE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD. LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY, AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DECISION - MAKING. NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO.  FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN? I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THE REAL DEAL. LIKE HOW A TEENAGE GIRL BECOMING A MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DON'T FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY'RE ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORSE. BOOKS AND MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE'S LIFE OTHER THAN YOU. SO THAT'S ONE REASON.  SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS ARE LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE, IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VIOLENCE AND STUFF, THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH, LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALLED MY HOOD. AND THIS BOOK TALKS ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS, ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD.  THIRDLY, MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF DON'T REALLY LIKE TO GET ADVICE OR TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS. AND THEY CAN GET A BOOK OR SOMETHING THAT HAS THE SAME FEATURES AS WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH. THOSE BOOKS AND THINGS ARE NOT VERY BAD; THEY ACTUALLY HELP. AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE, THEY'RE REALLY NOT BAD; THEY'RE LIKE A LITTLE GUIDE TO MANY PEOPLE.  SO IN CONCLUSION, DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MAGAZINES, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE? ABSOLUTELY NOT BECAUSE THOSE BOOKS TALK ABOUT REAL LIFE, AND LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. We should embrace these materials as they offer valuable insights and lessons that can better prepare us for the realities of the world.
466	3443	2	3	Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people, especially in @MONTH1, may not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie late at night, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if the @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. If you saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is raised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored. Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 kid quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 child talking about things that are way over his head. Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern - day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. Their songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers weren't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things. As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One might think that once they're older they can do what they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate, shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinent until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases. If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we continue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot, things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds.
467	3444	2	3	I do not believe that movies, books, music, etc. should be removed from shelves. I firmly believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to, read or watch, as everybody has their own level of maturity. Parents who are concerned about their child watching/reading something, always have the right to tell them no, and to keep whatever it is out of their grasp. People are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate - level material for themselves. Whether it is books, movies or music, a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item. It is a good idea to keep more explicit things only for adults, but if it is supposed to be for a certain age level, it should be out for the choice to be up to that certain person. Different people have different levels of maturity, so it is hard for one person or company to say what age level should or should not be using that material. A lot of parents will disagree with this issue, because they think that children should be kept away from the violence and vulgar images or language that are in the media these days. But at the same time, they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to. People have the right to take away material that is too mature for their child, but no one should be able to say that someone else's child should not be able to view that material, because just because one person in @MONTH1 may find it offensive, does not mean that other people will. If someone should find something offensive they should have the common sense to not view that material any more, it's that simple. Everyone has that right so I do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them. Parents can censor what their children watch, and adults have the ability to make their own decisions about this topic. This clearly proves that certain items, like books, movies, and music, should not be taken off the shelf.
468	3445	2	3	I personally don't believe they should use censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone in @MONTH1 might think that it is offensive because, that's just one person's opinion. What's one man's trash is another man's gold, what one person finds offensive could be sought out by millions. Plus in today's world if everything was censored there would be nothing left, not even the church because everyone has their own opinion and their own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at least one person who thinks something is offensive in some way, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to express themselves. If censorship was used everywhere, schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kids would have nothing to engage with. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was censored there would be nothing left to be enjoyed. Think about it this way: would you like someone telling you that you're not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset, especially if they're an adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control people's lives.
469	3446	2	3	The quote that Katherine Paterson declares makes a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in another's point of view. Everybody thinks differently and as you go to school or work everyday you can find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing style can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think it's offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyone's personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disgusting and cruel. I have actually had a real - life situation where this has been a conflict. During the years of my seventh - grade experience, there was this PlayStation game that I loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 community found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things I loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes, how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody's possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rot and vanish forever. I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taken off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you don't like the novel, then I advise you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?
470	3447	2	3	Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another in @MONTH1 may not see any true beauty in it. But when people hardly understand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know @CAPS2 it is like to be truly offended. When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyone's group. Everyone seemed to have already had friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I had a bad odor or was dressed in an out - of - style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I knew it, school was half - way over. I was still a nobody. Then @PERSON1 came along and made me a somebody. @PERSON1, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, @PERSON1 approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with @PERSON1. Months went by before I realized @PERSON1 and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though @PERSON1 and I were close, I felt as though @CAPS3 was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything @CAPS3 needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no. @PERSON1 and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to linger for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly @PERSON1 spoke and said, '@CAPS1 why are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. @PERSON1 sensed that I had no clue @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was talking about so @CAPS3 continued. 'I'm gay.' I was appalled. Not because @CAPS3 was gay, but because @CAPS3 had never told me. I asked, '@CAPS2 what happened?' @CAPS3 sat on the couch then and told me about how @CAPS3 was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays. I felt awful for @PERSON1. It wasn't his fault @CAPS3 was gay. I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be allowed on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them. Not read or listen to things that can hurt someone's inner feelings. In a world where diversity should be celebrated, allowing offensive materials to be freely accessible only breeds more intolerance and pain.
471	3448	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I do indeed believe that certain books, magazines, or any other form of reading material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive. I say this because, in every situation, either one side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits. If you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences, then do not put it on a public display. It is best that they are in a solitary area for audiences mature enough to handle the influence and/or consequences that go along with that type of material. I say influence because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media. These children act in ways that reflect what they have seen. For example, if they watch a movie full of violence, they may feel it is their job to act in violent manners. Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility to make their own decisions, they let the outside world decide what is best. As a child grows up, they are obligated to follow certain rules or take authoritative matters seriously. Authority teaches us as children. We develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings. You might ask what it is I am speaking about. Well, I believe that this situation relates to the phrase 'think before you speak' because it seems that the people displaying this media don't think about the after - effects of their actions. I suggest that certain material not only impacts children and teens, but adults are highly affected as well. I am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people. I am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are, along with the way we were raised. The media gives us insight and ideas, which sometimes revolve around our every thought. I do believe that certain media should be displayed in confidential locations. If not, then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit. My concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, @LOCATION1.
472	3449	2	3	Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young readers. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. They believe that having young people exposed to this offensive material will affect the choices they make and how they will react in certain situations. For instance, it could lead them to make poor decisions in friendships or school - related matters. At the same time, other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. It's that person's right to choose whether or not it is age - appropriate for them or not. It's not someone else's right to take away choices that aren't theirs. People who believe that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds. They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying. This in turn will create a different mindset for the young reader. Which may cause the young reader to be more aggressive or more likely to make bad decisions about their well - being or the well - being of those around them. These people want their libraries to be about learning and be a healthy environment where young minds can grow naturally and unharmed by offensive material. People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say it's no one else's right to make this decision for you by removing them. It's the reader's right to choose whether or not to read the material. The reader will most likely learn what the material is saying regardless of whether it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe environment than to have someone else later in their life show them or tell them. The environment may be a lot more dangerous than a library if learned through someone else. I believe in both in a way. I believe it is not someone else's right to remove these books from libraries. But I also believe that it should not be available for young readers to get. These books may be offensive to some people but it's their choice to read it. They do not have to read these books; it does not affect them. I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have access to. If a reader's parents want them to learn about it in a safe environment, then they should sit their children down and explain it to them themselves. In the end, we all have our rights and we use those to choose whether to read or listen to certain material. It is no one else's choice besides your own.
473	3450	2	3	While there are many books written out there that offend many types of people, there are some that just need to be wiped off the face of the earth. The saying 'those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it' is one of my favorite quotes, and I don't use it lightly. Take, for example, 'The @ORGANIZATION1'. This book gives instructions to build bombs, teaches you how to use firearms, etc. This book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand, like their religion and how they look. This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach. That's why I think this book needs to be taken off the shelves for good. There was also hate propaganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive, and that's disgusting. I would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone. One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than @PERSON1, the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to their undeserved graves. He sent men, women, and children to his many death camps and work camps. One of those many children was @PERSON2, who was in hiding from the Gestapo or '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. Because of this monster, the @CAPS7 lost one of the world's greatest and most profound writers for the @DATE1's. This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the'supposed' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. But if we did not have this book, we would be sure to expect another @CAPS8 on our hands. All in all, censorship in the libraries should be a rule but only for the books worth keeping not these horrific books. We need to ensure that libraries remain a place of knowledge and positive influence, free from the taint of such hateful materials.
474	3451	2	3	The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire. Not everyone is interested in the same book genre. The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of. If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it. They should not be removed from the shelves of the library. I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library. What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing? If the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. For example, if a particular movie is popular among a niche group of horror - movie enthusiasts, removing it because one person found it too gruesome would disappoint those fans. If a mother of a six - year - old boy wanted to report an inappropriate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie. It just is not fair to everyone else. The library is public property. With that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment. They are obligated to supply books, movies, etc. for whomever. If one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want. A few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library. There were too many complaints about inappropriate books being supplied or taken off of the shelves. That year, the library lost @PERCENT1 of their customers because every time the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased. If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy. If someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can search another shelf. Those who complain are only making more work for themselves. By allowing a wide range of materials to be available, the library can truly serve as a place for all to explore and enjoy.
475	3452	2	3	Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain people? In all honesty, yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting. No matter what the content that the book or @CAPS1 contains, it's their choice. There is a power called freedom in this world. One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are written in that book or sang in a song, then yes, read and listen to anything you want. If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex, you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it. So yes, any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them. It's not that you have to be mature enough to read a book; it's that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say. Yes, some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later. Reading and music let you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before. Both books and songs are a way to express yourself, and everyone should express themselves in some way. When it comes to movies, that's a different story. Those movies are rated for a reason. On a rated @CAPS2 film, I could see @NUM1 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads. Also, most have been in sex education class. Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too. So yes, let @NUM1 year olds on up watch rated @CAPS2 films. The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them. Say a parent took a @NUM3 year old to see a scary movie; more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from seeing blood, stabbing, and sexual content. Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for. When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools and also good for self - expression. So learn, experience, and express. No matter what you're interested in, freedom was given to you, so use it to explore the world of knowledge and creativity through these mediums.
476	3453	2	3	I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in high school. Three of the best books I have read throughout my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and contained inappropriate language in them. Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have freedom of speech and press, so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time, children disagree with their parents anyway, so they are going to read whatever they want to read, watch what they want, or even listen to what they want. People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library, but that's wrong. If you don't like them, then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book; it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section, and those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too, and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think they're offensive. That takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then, if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive, there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think they're offensive. When I am an adult, I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what, they will anyway. If they want to read a book with bad language in it, or watch a movie with language, then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall, I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries just because people complain about them being offensive.
477	3454	2	3	I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. There are certain books, music, movies, and magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some awful material in them. The pictures in magazines, on CD cases, or on movie/DVD cases would have stuff that people might find really offensive. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all around the world. People might not understand what certain materials are trying to convey, but they might get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely tell people not to get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. In conclusion, certain materials that are clearly offensive and inappropriate should indeed be removed from the shelves to maintain a proper environment.
478	3455	2	3	Libraries have the right to decide how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material might be considered offensive to certain people. However, some materials that might be offensive to one person might not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, writing, and many other rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves. There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. However, just because some materials might be found offensive to someone, they might not be found offensive to others. A library might not be able to please everyone. 'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then they also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if someone finds something offensive and wants it removed from a shelf, then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves. A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disturbances. A person probably isn't looking for something offensive. Therefore, coming across something that is offensive might be disturbing; however, they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that person's choice to choose that library to visit. So, they might choose to maybe find offensive materials. If someone does not wish to come across offensive material, they should choose not to go to the library. Americans have the right to be free, and so does a library. If a person comes across an offensive piece of material, it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of its merchandise that might be considered offensive. There simply would be nothing left. People should be aware that they might come across some offensive materials when going into a library, so it will always be the people's choice of attending that library. In conclusion, libraries should uphold their right to curate their collections while people should be more understanding and accepting of the diverse materials available.
479	3456	2	3	I believe that some material should be removed if it is very offensive. I also believe that if it's helping you learn, then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone has different thoughts about what is offensive or appropriate and what's not. Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books, music, movies, magazines, and so on are appropriate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be appropriate for them. And the library should put warning stickers on the book so that the person knows about the graphic or vulgar language. Therefore, I believe that the libraries should put warning signs on anything to reduce fewer books being removed from the shelves. And so, my decision is to not remove certain material, only if it's offensive. The libraries should use warning stickers on books so that people know ahead of time about the graphic or vulgar language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our libraries. Even though a lot of people will disagree, this is what I believe should happen. Here's why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger, just starting to read, I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother, then she takes the book away and gives it to the librarian and told what happened. I guess I said a very inappropriate word, and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now every time my mother takes my younger brothers to the library, she makes sure the book they want is appropriate for their age group so the same incident won't happen again. Wouldn't you be the same way with your children? I know I would, not just for my kids but for other children also. In conclusion, using warning stickers is a practical solution to balance the need for access to various materials and the concern about offensive content.
480	3457	2	3	In today's world, being a child isn't the easiest thing. They have ideas and thoughts racing through their minds constantly, whether it is the stress of school or what they're doing this weekend. But the last thought a child would have is if the literature they're reading is offensive or not. I do not think that censorship should be enforced more than it already is. Although parents and the government would disagree, censorship is going to do nothing but make our future children more close - minded and sheltered than they already are. Children shouldn't lose their innocence so soon, but they shouldn't be so naive about the world either. So, I'm against censorship because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered. Censorship is already posted on music and movies, and it's not doing anything. Children are still going to listen to music that isn't appropriate for their age, but they don't know the meaning behind the lyrics. And censoring movies and TV shows isn't going to help much either because of the internet. It has made it easier for teens and children to access things more easily. So, unless we censor the internet to a certain extent, which nobody wants that to happen, then we have to let our children be more open to the public world because they will find out about certain things sooner or later. Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually, but it doesn't have to. If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certain things, then censorship wouldn't be needed. In conclusion, instead of relying on censorship, parents should engage in open communication with their children to help them navigate the world appropriately.
481	3458	2	3	Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I am writing to you on @DATE1 because there is so much conflict regarding the issue of 'if materials in the library are offensive, should they be removed from their shelves'. I know there are people who will agree or disagree, but what I think they should do is leave them. Yes, I said it; they should stay right where they are.  People all over this world get themselves worked up over all the little things in life, but what we don't understand is that there is always going to be something in life we don't like, and that's never going to change. For example, people taking offense to materials in the library and wanting them to be removed. I mean, come on, people, wake up and realize you are not always going to have things as you want them. There's always going to be things you just have to deal with.  I believe that these types of materials should stay right where they are because people can overlook them; we just decide not to. We all make a big deal over something so small. People should just not look at it and move on. Don't sit there and fuss about it. Just turn around and walk away. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others don't. Everybody in this world needs to see that there are things we're not going to like, but we have to get over them and move on. This will always happen, and there's nothing we can do about it.  All over the universe, people @MONTH1 agree or disagree with what I have to say, but it's your perspective, and what you think about it is your choice. I will say though that they should stay, but people need to get over themselves and see the truth in life and know that even though there are things we don't like, don't sit there and argue about it. Just leave it and go your own way.  So, this is my essay to you. People need to see that they're always not going to get what they want in life, but they need to move on. For instance, if you have a problem with the things around you, such as taking offense to materials in the library and wanting them removed, well, sorry, but no. Learn to walk away from it because what you like @MONTH1 not be what others like, and what they like @MONTH1 not be what you like. We just have to go on with life, leave it be because others' opinions @MONTH1 not match yours. Leave the materials alone because we as people need to see that we're not always going to get our way in life and to take hold of learning how to blow it off instead of making a big deal about something so little we could have walked away from. In conclusion, accepting the co - existence of different materials in the library is an important part of respecting diverse viewpoints and moving forward in life.
482	3459	2	3	I do not believe that books should be censored. I believe that if it is on the shelf, then anyone can pick it up. The books at the library are on a shelf, and little kids grab them every day. So, why can't they read them if they're in their sight? I've gone into libraries plenty of times, and in all my experiences, I have never come across an offensive book. If the books are offensive, I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see.  All the times I go to the libraries, I have never come across a book that was offensive. I think that if they allow some commercials to be put on television, then why can't some books be put on display? I believe that reading sharpens the mind, and if a kid picks up an adult book, who are we to say no, you cannot read that. The libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book, you would not pick it up in the first place. If your child picks up a book that you don't want them to read, then you should not have taken him to the store in the first place.  If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have, then go to a different store. The libraries have bigger issues to worry about than your personal taste of music. If you do not like certain magazines that they have, then order magazines online. There is no reason why you should have any complaints about a library. The library is a place to help you. It is not mandatory to go to one. If you do not like what they have, then do not go to the library.  Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc. should not be censored. If you don't like the movies they have, don't go to the library. If you think their magazines are inappropriate, then order magazines online. If you don't like their books, then order online or go to a book store. That is why I believe books should not be censored. In essence, the freedom of access to various materials in libraries is crucial for the overall intellectual growth and choice of individuals.
483	3460	2	3	As many would agree, censorship is a growing topic of concern throughout the world. I personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent. If one feels the content of music, a movie, or a book is questionable, he or she has the option of reading, listening, or watching.  Among many debated materials, movies have ratings, just as music has 'bleeps'. Movies are rated '@CAPS1' for all audiences, '@CAPS2' standing for parental guidance, '@NUM1' for parental guidance for ages @NUM2 and older, and lastly '@CAPS3' meaning that anyone under the age of @NUM3 is either suggested or required to have an adult present during the viewing of the film. At home, the ratings are all based on the parent's preference. At the movie theatre, the restrictions become a sort of law. Anyone below the age of thirteen is not permitted to see a movie that is '@NUM1' or '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by an adult (anyone @NUM5 or older). Anyone who isn't @NUM3 or older @MONTH1 not enter a movie rated '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by someone @NUM7 or older. Depending on where you are, the restrictions @MONTH1 be more or less harsh. Ultimately, the rating system is intended to force parents to choose what is and isn't appropriate for their child.  As for music on the radio, all 'curse words' are 'bleeped' out. If a person wants to buy their own music, artists are required to make two of the same album, one with censors and one without. Thus creating a decision usually for the parents, usually assuming they are the ones to buy the album or the music for their child.  When it comes to books, there are no ratings, just genres letting the reader know who the author's intended audience is. Types of genres include 'adult', 'young adult' and 'children' sections in libraries and book stores. Just like music and television, the final choice in the purchase is all dependent on the parents.  Even though many restrictions are put in place, there are still some faults to the system. Obviously, if you are @NUM2 or younger, you most likely won't have identification. This leaves the person working at the movie theatre the option to let in who they believe to be of age. Looks @MONTH1 be deceiving. Buying music from the internet doesn't require any type of identification either. How can they prove your age? When purchasing a book, not many cashiers would stop a child and say, 'that's inappropriate for you'. Maybe kids of all ages should have identification. Although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system, it seems to all lead back to the parents.  Censorship is a huge topic of discussion for the parents of today's young and growing society, but in reality, if they have an issue with the content, they themselves will either rid of the material or prohibit the use and or purchase of it. All in all, it's about the parents and their personal preference. In conclusion, while the censorship system has its flaws, parental responsibility remains the key factor in guiding children's exposure to various media.
484	3461	2	3	No books should be taken off the shelf. Most people have different taste in books, magazines or movies. If people find one of those offensive, then why can't they ignore it? They can go find a different one. Not everyone should have the same taste as one person; that's what makes the person we are today. If everyone had the same taste in everything, this would be a pretty boring world.  I'm more into horror novels more than anything. In my own opinion, I think they have a lot of excitement, with the killing and what not. I'm also not a big fan of reading; I read when I absolutely have nothing to do. It's very hard to move onto a different series of novels. Such as: romance, horror, adventures, even poetry! It takes a lot to understand poetry. Poetry has a lot of big descriptive words. @PERSON1, for instance, he's one of my favorite poets; he's actually pretty famous for all that he has done. Well, he didn't become famous until after his death.  Overall, not everyone has the same taste in books, magazines, movies or even poetry. We're all different even when it comes to this. Therefore, it is important to respect the diversity of reading materials on the shelves to accommodate everyone's interests.
485	3462	2	3	How often do you find a book or a magazine that you don't want children or someone to read? I mean I find them everyday. For example, how people use their language like swearing or even the TV show they watch. I also hear it when I'm with my friends or in a crowd of people. You hear them everyday even if you don't want to, but you do.  I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period. It's a public place, and no one wants to see anyone with those books in the library. What would happen if a child got a hold of one and they were looking at it, and it gave them nightmares or if it deals with crimes, rap, or mis - happenings with something wrong.  Sometimes what children read, they will say it or they will do it. So if a child sees it, they @MONTH1 think it's alright to do it or they might think it's amazing or cool to do and they might do it. Also again, you hear it on a daily basis like swearing. Let's say your child hears or reads horrible language and they might say it to you or some of your friends, and you won't know where they heard or who told them.  The movies even have something to do with it too, because all the movies are together, kids to adults movies. They should separate the movies or even get rid of the movies because the children could look at the case and see something scary or drug - related, something that you don't want your children to see or even hear.  Even though you hear them daily, you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around. They need to take those books that describe anything about crime, drugs, or even movies. That's why I think they should get rid of those books and movies off the shelves and get them away from children. In conclusion, ensuring a safe and appropriate environment for children in public places like libraries is of utmost importance, and removing such offensive materials is a necessary step.
486	3463	2	3	I think they shouldn't remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People have diverse sensibilities, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. If you start taking these things out, there's a high probability that you'll lose a vast amount of valuable resources, including books, and alienate your patrons. For example, some people are offended by movies that have violent scenes in them, while others enjoy the thrill of such shows. The library might be the only accessible source for someone to get hold of something they like. Another instance is that magazines can contain material you don't want your kids around or seeing. However, that same magazine could be a great help to a student working on an assignment at school. Kids might need the so - called offensive material as it could offer them unique perspectives and help them through life. In conclusion, I firmly believe we should not take movies and books out just because someone finds them offensive. Some of the offensive material could be a valuable educational tool for students. Other offensive material is enjoyed by some adults. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person will.
487	3464	2	3	Do people have the right to limit freedom? Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self - expression? Many individuals in today's world seem to think so. Book censorship is a significant and widespread concern in the world today. Whether books deemed 'offensive' should be removed from libraries or not is a pressing and serious issue. Censoring books not only restricts self - expression but also curtails knowledge and violates our constitutional right of free speech. I firmly believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is akin to putting a strict limit on human imagination. Throughout our lives, we are constantly urged to think outside of the box. As kids, we are taught that being unique and different is a virtue. We internalize these teachings, yet when writers express themselves in books, the very same people who encouraged out - of - the - box thinking want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are essentially telling the world that imagination is a negative trait. Many people wish to censor books to shield their children from 'offensive' material. They assume that by removing books they consider 'offensive' from libraries, they can protect their children from the harsh realities of the world. This is a fallacy. People may attempt to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without books. Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a very scandalous book. Due to the language this book used, many people regarded it as trash and wanted it to be censored. Today, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language, it offers a glimpse into a part of American history. And to think, if people back then had removed it from the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book and gained the knowledge from it. It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was founded on the principle of freedom. Under the constitution, we are guaranteed freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are undermining our freedom of speech. No one should be allowed to tell you that you can't read a book you desire to read. No one should be allowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you wish. If we start censoring books, writers will be compelled to censor their personal thoughts, which will severely limit their freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is restricted, what other freedoms will be compromised in the years to come? Book censorship and censorship in general are not beneficial; all they do is impose limitations. If we start censoring books, we are sending a message to our children that being different is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, we must ask ourselves how long it will be until our other rights are also restricted. Where will this downward spiral end? Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to seriously ask ourselves if we have the right to limit freedom.
488	3465	2	3	In my own personal opinion, this letter to the newspaper expressing my views on censorship in libraries is that I firmly believe music, books, magazines, and other media should remain on the shelves. If they can be created and illustrated, they should be available for people to read or listen to. The following will discuss the content of music, books, magazines, etc. In the music industry, many people think some songs are inappropriate, but this actually ruins the essence and purpose of the entire song. Perhaps age advice could be provided, but that should be the extent of it; we should not cut down on the content. Magazines are like illustrated books and should be accessible to anyone. If they are well - created and illustrated, they should be allowed everywhere. Movies should also be placed in the library with age advice. After all, someone had to approve that movie to be released in theatres, on TV, or on streaming platforms. From my experience, I have witnessed people complaining about these things. I truly don't understand why one should complain about such matters. Now, it's up to you to decide what your views are on censorship in libraries. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of creative works and avoid unnecessary censorship.
489	3466	2	3	What is censorship? Censorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can also be misconstrued as common courtesy. The real question is what exactly are we limiting? Censorship is not something to support. Censoring a book is like having a chocolate cake without the chocolate; it takes away the value and enjoyment from education. Though many individuals disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that. Some people find that 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the 'n - word'. However, there is an argument against this. There are several African - American scholars that I know who find the 'n - word' offensive in general, but not in the context of these books. They say that it adds more educational value to the book because in the time of Mark Twain, the 'n - word' was an accepted part of the language. That was simply the social norm back then. Back then and now, censorship is a way of hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considered 'inappropriate' are the ones trying to expose the truth. The 'inappropriate' language or experiences are the ones that actually occur and are the words that are really spoken. By using censorship, we are creating a false sense of security and sheltering the world. Censorship is a tool we use to block ourselves from facing reality. Is this the right choice? Is it right to send sheltered teens out into the world, ill - equipped to fend for themselves? Or should we let them understand how the real world works? In conclusion, we should resist the urge to censor and embrace the realness in creative works.
490	3467	2	3	Censorship 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote was from an author named Katherine Paterson. I firmly believe that certain materials such as books should not be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, then what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read. I have come across many offensive books. Whether they involve religious beliefs or contain excessive sexual content, I'm certain they're offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you were to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, then what would the author who wrote the book think? The world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to simply get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone. I believe censorship is unnecessary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read, but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been eagerly waiting to find that book. If I did remove it, then I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book. Censorship in general is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't believe anyone has the right to take something that someone has worked hard on for so long to create and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you won't approve of. Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive? Books are there to help us become more educated and more open - minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people. If you don't like a book because it offends you, then don't read it. It's as simple as that. If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read, and we'll lose the rich cultural and educational heritage that books provide.
491	3468	2	3	If someone is actively looking for an offensive book, they will surely find it, regardless of whether it's gathering dust on a library shelf or is brand - new in a bookstore. The same situation applies to an offensive video game, magazine, or movie. Removing these offensive items from library shelves will simply prompt the people seeking them to search elsewhere. Different individuals hold varying opinions on what is offensive and what isn't. The Satanic Verses is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs. While numerous people found The Satanic Verses offensive, others thoroughly enjoyed the story. If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then those who really loved the book would have been deprived of the chance to read it. Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, in most cases, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive throughout. Even if a movie has one offensive scene, the rest of the movie could be an excellent story that many people would benefit from watching. It's the same concept with a book or magazine. There might be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but it's very rare to find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive from start to finish. Of course, there are still offensive items that would be inappropriate for younger kids to see, even with just one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or articles. There are easier solutions to this problem than completely removing the items from the shelves. One solution could be for libraries to set age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too inappropriate. But more importantly, it's the parents' responsibility to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to. Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from library shelves would only lead to more problems and complaints. I firmly believe it's a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk'.
492	3469	2	3	Censorship in school libraries is important, yet at the same time, it's not entirely necessary. I'm of the opinion that many books in the school library are inappropriate for younger children. However, these same books shouldn't be removed from our libraries because I believe high - schoolers are mature enough to read this kind of material. The content in these books isn't any different from what occurs during the high - school years. Most of these books offer a perspective on real - life stories and can potentially help someone cope and realize that they're not alone. At the same time, though, many of these books do contain curse words, some sexual scenes, descriptions of partying, drinking, and drug use. These books are too advanced for elementary - school - age children and perhaps even middle - school - age children to read. For example, the books by Ellen Hopkins, these books are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregnant, ends up in jail, and becomes homeless. I've read these books; they're really good and they showed me how just trying one drug, one time, could ruin your whole life. I learned a great deal from these books, but I don't think anyone younger than fourteen should be reading them. There should be a limit on the censorship. Many of the things discussed in the books are the same as what's talked about in the school hallways. What's the difference? That's why authors write about these things, so they can connect with teenagers. Many books are based on an author's experiences, so they're intended for high - school - age readers. Many authors will indicate an age level on their books, like fourteen and older. Libraries should pay attention to these ratings before adding the books to their collections. Someone might become offended by what they read in a book, but I don't think the book should be removed from the shelf because of one person. If it becomes a more widespread issue, then yes, it should be taken off. But at the same time, that one book could be someone else's escape from the hardships in their life. Many adults would disagree with my statements because they think that if a teenager is reading about someone drinking, doing drugs, or having sex, they're more likely to engage in those activities. I believe this isn't true because the book I'm currently reading has scenes of partying and drinking, but I'm not out doing those things. What's the difference between someone reading it in a book and seeing it on television? I see many worse things on the internet than I read in books. Parents should be glad that their teenager is reading instead of playing video games or hanging out with friends. These are just my opinions. Some people might agree with me and others might disagree, but I'll stand by my views.
493	3470	2	3	Censorship in Libraries. Censorship is a major conflict in many libraries. There are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be placed on the shelves. There is often a week where people read all of the books that have been banned from school libraries. I participate in this school - wide challenge because I disagree with banning books. Banning books can have both positive and very negative aspects for many reasons. First off, I like to consider the situation from the author or writer's perspective. How would you feel if you spent around five years writing a story or a movie for kids, and it got banned in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves? I don't think many people would be happy about that. I also think that many people don't regard authors as being that important. When I think about it, it makes me realize all the things we wouldn't be able to read in our world, including newspapers, books, and magazines. Maybe we should also consider that it takes a great deal of effort to write the things that people want to hear or see. I feel that when books or movies get banned or removed, it makes the author feel worthless. The parents' point of view makes the situation even more complicated. Think of it like this: your child comes home from school with a book that he/she wants you to read with them. You sit down and start reading, and suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate scene in the story. You stop reading immediately and look at your child, who is enjoying the violence and loving the story! What would you do? Many parents would call the school, explain what happened, and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children who could access it. But taking it away is pointless because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that kids can't find it elsewhere. How do you think your child would feel if a story they loved suddenly disappeared? I know it would make me feel like I'd done something wrong. Taking things off shelves also has a positive side. When you take the book, movie, or magazine off the shelf, it's gone forever from that library. This can be a good thing because then kids won't have an obvious way to get the story. If you don't want your child or other children to see it, it's a reasonable idea. It makes the banned object harder to find and also less likely to catch kids' interest. If the book or movie isn't readily available, kids will be less likely to become interested in it. There are many different views on censorship, which can influence decisions about what happens in libraries. My view on this topic is negative, and I fully support it. If an author works hard on writing a story, they shouldn't be punished for expressing their feelings. Many people face this issue, and there are diverse views on the topic. Next Banned Book Week, I'll be standing up for the authors whose work has been banned. I hope you will too.
494	3471	2	3	Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I firmly believe it should be, and here are a few different viewpoints. First of all, why should books be removed from shelves just because some people don't like the plot of a series? There are over a million of us people out there, and we all have different preferences. Moreover, reading is one area where we differ from each other. One person might prefer peaceful, warm - hearted stories, while others want something more intense to read. Since all of us are different around the world, humans have varying tastes in food, music, movies, and books. Everyone has different ways to satisfy their reading pleasures. To me, books are like religions; not all of us are the same in this regard, and at the same time, we all freely practice our religions without punishment. So why would you take away books that people love to read freely? In my eyes, it's simply not right. It's like taking candy away from an innocent baby because it might rot its teeth. What I mean is that, sure, some books might offend certain people, yet there might be others who find the books of those offended people offensive, and so on. But as long as a baby's teeth aren't actually rotting, why take the candy away? That is, if the books have individual shelves with clear labels about what they're all about, which they usually do, people wouldn't feel so offended when finding them in the wrong place. Looking at these viewpoints, do you understand where I'm coming from? We're all human beings, yet in books, we find different parts of ourselves. I know many book - readers with a wide range of tastes. No matter who they are and who their friends are, we're all unique. Many people other than myself would agree with this. So, tell me again why censorship shouldn't be in public libraries.
495	3472	2	3	Books are a form of history, each one narrating a story from the past. In history, we don't block any offensive events that took place, so why should we remove any books that have offensive material in them? It would be unjust to deprive kids of any learning tools. Books are extremely important learning tools in today's schools, and there's always something new for a kid to learn in every book. So, even taking away one book could mean a kid learns one less thing. And doing this intentionally would go against everything that schools stand for. There are many different genres of books, but not everyone likes every genre. If a person only likes to read young - adult books because it relates to their culture, which most likely will have offensive language and events, and if you were to take these books away from a young adult in school, once again, this person would miss out on reading because they're not interested in the remaining books in the library. If you can even think of one instance where a student could be stripped of a learning opportunity, you shouldn't do it. The fact is, there are numerous reasons why you shouldn't remove any literature from library shelves.
496	3473	2	3	Libraries shouldn't remove items just because some people find them offensive. People have diverse preferences when it comes to books. For instance, some love mystery novels, while others prefer romance or non - fiction. Removing certain books reduces the overall selection. A lower selection of books means less people have a compelling reason to visit the library, resulting in a less vibrant and useful community resource.
497	3474	2	3	Can books, music, movies, and other materials be perfect for everyone? Everyone has their own unique opinions and deeply - held beliefs on what materials are good and what are not acceptable for the human mind. All over the world, young kids, young adults, and adults are actively engaged in reading books, flipping through magazines, listening to music, and watching movies. These are all hobbies that most people genuinely enjoy. Everyone reads different kinds of books, whether it's a thrilling mystery, a heart - warming romance, or a thought - provoking bible - based book. Removing books, magazines, and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful, empty library. When people come and search for a book to read, they search for what they think they will enjoy. If they enjoy one thing, another person might not. They might find a book offensive, but does that mean everyone else is offended by the book as well? Taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book. Everyone is different, everyone has their own story, just like these books do. Magazines are like books, they are meant to be enjoyed. I believe some magazines might not be appropriate for some people, but that doesn't mean they should take it off the shelf. It means that person should simply not read it. Magazines are made for all people to enjoy, that's why there are so many different kinds. They aim to fit each magazine personally to each individual. Music is the number one entertainment people enjoy. There is a reason why there are so many different genres. The music industry tries their best to sort the music to your taste. Just because one song has stuff in it you don't like doesn't mean you can delete that song from everyone. Music is used for many different ways. It relaxes you, pumps you up, it is used for parties, events, and so many other things. All songs are different so you can use them however you want. To ban music because someone doesn't like it, changes music forever. There would be no music to listen to. People should be able to watch what movies they want. That's why there are ratings on movies. What is acceptable for teenagers, might not be acceptable for young kids. That's why they should not watch it. If people banned all the movies they thought were inappropriate, there would be no rented movie stores, theaters, or success in the movie production industry. Everyone should know what kind of movies they like, and they should just watch what they like, and leave the other movies for the people who enjoy them. In conclusion, no, books, magazines, movies, and music can not be perfect for everyone. Materials bring all different kinds of subjects and stories for everyone. Each material brings enjoyment to different people. To ban all the materials you believe is inappropriate will leave the shelves empty. What kind of library or entertainment world would that be?
498	3475	2	3	I, as a student, a child, and a citizen of the United States, firmly believe that every book should be allowed in any library. Books are a medium to express a wide range of feelings and emotions, just like movies and music. If we don't have them, how will we be able to learn anything in this world? Each book out there has a unique explanation, a captivating title, and a valid reason to be read. Today, millions of people read more and more because of the vast array of books available. I do believe, however, that the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different. It doesn't matter what the book is about; some might seem offensive, but everyone has something that they dislike. There are many people out there who get defensive over various things, for example, certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing, and even sports. We all have our own opinions. If you do not like a certain book because it has content that you don't like, then it's simple – don't read it. Others might like it. Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere. In conclusion, a diverse collection of these materials enriches our cultural and intellectual lives, and we should embrace this diversity rather than restricting access.
499	3476	2	3	"Dear newspaper, In my opinion, I don't think that censorship in libraries should be imposed on materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more materials. Censoring materials in the library could result in many problems. I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons. In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I disagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials. Many libraries in the world currently have censoring on their materials. I believe that libraries have a lot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they often have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicit content. Libraries shouldn't censor their materials, but in my opinion, they also shouldn't let under - age children check out any kind of material that is only meant to be viewed by adults. Also, if computer access is offered to children, an adult supervisor should be nearby to make sure that no explicit content is being viewed. Censoring in libraries could result in many problems, such as customers not getting all the information they need for a certain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school. If all of these things happen due to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials, then many libraries will not get as many customers. Yes, most people sometimes visit libraries for the wrong reasons, but to other people, those so - called ""wrong reasons"" might be the reason for them to gain more information. Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people. But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people. If something is found offensive to one person, I don't think it should be removed from the shelves. If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain. In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that much information could be lost. Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad; it can also mean that the material is just not appropriate to be viewed or read by that certain age group. If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off. Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either, but it can hide a lot of information from us, which is not good at all. Libraries should strike a balance between protecting the young and providing access to all knowledge."
500	3477	2	3	"I think that all books, music, movies, magazines, and anything that's offensive should be taken off shelves because there are little kids that read books and they don't need to hear or read offensive things. But at the same time, for the people that do want to hear or read things like that, then there should be an area in the library for materials like that. There are all kinds of libraries that have offensive books, movies, magazines. Other reasons they should take offensive materials off the shelves is because it could be racist or just offensive to certain things. People don't want to see or read about white people hating black people or black people hating white people or any type of racist things. It shouldn't be allowed because it can hurt someone's feelings. I have my own observations with reading some books from my school library and have come across some words that were offensive. Like in some books they use the word ""nigger"" and since I'm black it's offensive to me. I know that they are not saying it to me, but they still say it and it kinda touches me in a way. I'm not saying that it is offensive towards all people, but it is to me. So the way they could handle it is like I said, instead of having offensive books out on shelves, they should have one area where materials like that could be found instead of having the material where children and other people will get offended. The last thing I wanna talk about is that for children and other people, they don't want to see nasty things that are in books. If I had a kid, I wouldn't want my children to see nasty things that could be offensive. There are also books that talk about drugs and people don't want to hear or read about that. But there are some people also that do want to see or read about things like that, like older people. They have different point of views about things, so that's why again, there should be one area in libraries for materials like that. In conclusion, I think that libraries should hear me out and take in what I have to say because the materials that are in books, music, or magazines can be offensive to anybody. Any race could be offended by what they see or read. So again, there should be a place in libraries for that, to ensure that both the sensitivities of the young and the interests of others are respected."
501	3478	2	3	Censorship is indeed a significant aspect in many aspects of library operations. There are numerous books, a wide range of movies, various magazines, and accessible computers that anyone who wishes to use can do so. Kids truly love to go to the library to pick up interesting books and simply hang out with their friends. Some strict - minded parents might firmly believe that certain books, inappropriate magazines, and offensive music should not be present at the library. But this view isn't shared by everyone else. I firmly believe people have different perspectives about such things. There are those who think their kids seeing bad content will make them want to imitate it. Others, however, think their kids seeing those offensive things will enable them to learn from it. Another issue that people often consider a problem in libraries is the talking. Not every person who goes to the library wants to just sit in silence and not talk to anyone. As a result, most people avoid going to libraries because of this. Libraries are actually fun places to visit. You can almost get any book you desire to read there. There's no real reason for any parent to be worried about their child reading a book that isn't suitable for their age group. This is because libraries are very meticulous about having sections clearly labeled for different age groups. Moreover, the child would not be able to check out the inappropriate book as the library staff are quite vigilant in ensuring it isn't a book that shouldn't be read by that person. Also, most younger kids who visit the library are always accompanied by an adult. So, the parent can keep a close eye on their kid if they don't believe it's right for them to read the offensive books. Parents should refrain from letting their kids go to the library alone if they're worried about them doing or looking at something bad. Talking at libraries can be enjoyable because you can discuss the book you're reading or just have a casual hang - out. However, the staff and other people there get extremely annoyed if kids are laughing or talking loudly about something. I think they should designate a specific floor where people can go to hang out and talk freely. In libraries, there are far more good things to do than bad, and people always feel welcome there. The books that people claim are offensive are usually the most interesting ones. So, if you don't want to see or don't want your kids to see the offensive books and movies, you should make sure not to enter the adult section. In conclusion, libraries should strike a balance between providing access to diverse materials and considering the concerns of different patrons.
502	3479	2	3	A library is a wonderful place where one can go to find a vast array of books, a rich collection of music, and other useful resources. It's a big and valuable resource; it offers a huge variety of help for people from all walks of life. The crucial question is, should everything that you can have access to be removed from the library shelves if it's found offensive? If books, music, or anything else on the shelves were discovered to be offensive, they should be carefully removed from the regular shelves. They should have a dedicated section for those certain kinds of materials. To access that specific material, you would have to obtain a librarian's permission. This way, it can't come off as offensive to anyone. You might be wondering why you couldn't just leave it on the shelf. You can't simply leave it on the shelf because it could potentially be offensive to someone's cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth. So, therefore, that's exactly why they would have to be removed. I do firmly believe they should be removed for those various valid reasons. Libraries are a place to go to be used as resources or for pure fun. Everyone who goes to a library should have access to everything that meets their needs. In conclusion, by segregating offensive materials and having a permission - based access system, libraries can better serve all their patrons.
503	3480	2	3	Is it really understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age? No, it is not. The whole situation of whether or not libraries should have things such as movies, engaging books, and cool CDs restricted to certain people due to their age should not be a major issue. My reasoning for this is not because of how it might influence people in a bad way. On the contrary, it might influence them in a truly fantastic way. That's how people discover who they are, such as what they're interested in, what they like, and what they want to pursue in life. If it weren't for establishments such as libraries, most people would be just the same as others and not have a unique sense of character. People would be overly similar and have very few differences from one another. People should, of course, be aware of some of the content in books. But it should not be to the point where those areas become restricted to certain age groups. Movies and CDs are more understandable to have restrictions due to the actual graphic violence and explicit language that some musicians and actors might use. However, in a book, it's not just about what other people are doing and saying; it's about what you yourself are reading and how you yourself are interpreting it. It takes more than just the actions and words described to reflect on what you're reading and how you're engaging with it. That's why the whole situation should not be about restricting certain things such as movies, books, and CDs to a certain age group. Instead, the areas should be clearly labeled on what the category is so that people know before looking. In conclusion, libraries should focus on labeling rather than absolute age - based restrictions to allow for personal discovery.
504	3481	2	3	Many books in libraries contain profanity, and it just depends on how you read and carefully analyze the profanity. To some people, the strong words are actually quite useful as they help the reader clearly grasp the point the writer is trying to convey in their head. To others, however, these words are simply offensive. I strongly disagree that most books are offensive to readers. I believe that they just assist the writers in getting their points across effectively. Many children do come across books with offensive language. But if they only read books that are within their appropriate age level, then they shouldn't encounter such problems. In adult books, there is typically more offensive language. But from an adult's perspective, it's a different story because they hear, and possibly even use, a lot of the words that they are seeing in these books on a regular basis. I believe that any offensive reading material should be identified and then moved to a specific area of the library. If you are an adult, you can then check these books out. This is an effective way to keep the children away from these books and their offensive words and to keep them 'innocent' for a longer time. Children don't really need to be reading books with offensive language anyway, but of course, this ultimately depends on their guardian's decision. It's not necessarily a bad thing to have strong language in books, as long as the reader who has the book is taking it in the way the writer intends, which is most likely to enhance the theme. Children should be kept away from these books, but they should not be completely removed from the shelves. They should just be placed in their own area for adults to read exclusively. In conclusion, a proper segregation of offensive materials in libraries can satisfy the needs of both adults and protect the innocence of children.
505	3482	2	3	All libraries are well - equipped with books suitable for all readers, regardless of their age. The books on the shelf are arranged, or at least they should be arranged, in alphabetical order with the last name of the author coming first. I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as thought - provoking books, engaging music, captivating movies, and interesting magazines should be removed due to some of the explicit graphics in each reading material. Every bookshelf should be carefully arranged according to age difference and clearly separated from the other books and bookshelves. If a child is in the appropriate aisle for their age - styled books, fewer children would pick up the wrong book. If children would learn to listen and follow the directions on where to find their specific age - appropriate books, fewer mistakes of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur. If a child takes the wrong age - appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would assume that their parent(s) would be responsible enough to take it back and get the right book for their child(s). If parents take prompt action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf. Wouldn't children learn from this experience and understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, they should not do it again? I reiterate that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material. The books on each bookshelf are or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first. All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age. In conclusion, proper arrangement and parental guidance can ensure that children access age - appropriate materials in libraries.
506	3483	2	3	In many libraries, there are books, movies, magazines, and music that some people find offensive. The degree of offensiveness varies from person to person, with some finding them more offensive than others. I firmly believe that just because someone finds these things offensive, they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. This is because other people might be interested in them, we need the information from the resources in the libraries, and all books have the potential to make people more intelligent. These resources are in the library for a valid reason. If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can easily find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For instance, there are books that talk about real - life events happening to real people, and some might not be able to handle the descriptive details provided; if it's too difficult to handle, they can simply put the book back and go read something else. Everyone in this world has different preferences. In addition, some books in the library are used for informational purposes. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world rely on a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they may need these resources to assist with a class or a presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information just because it was found offensive. Lastly, all books contribute to making people more intelligent. Sometimes things are complex and these books help explain them better. We learn something new every day, and a large part of that learning comes from reading books. Not only books but magazines and movies also play a role. Reading books helps people strengthen their vocabulary and communication skills. For example, those who read more than others are usually more involved in plays and have no problem speaking in front of people. This is due to their higher intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to have better memory and a larger vocabulary compared to those who do not read. So, as you can see, people have different likes and dislikes, and some will find these resources offensive. Also, books are essential for helping people and making them more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed, our intelligence levels would not be as good as they could be. Every human being will face problems in life, and that's just the nature of life. We have to learn to deal with these problems. In fact, when these issues of offensive resources come up, we should understand that we all have different outlooks on everything. Removing books from the shelves would not solve anything; instead, they can only benefit us.
507	3484	2	3	"I think that people who find offensive books, music, movies, and magazines just need to stay away from them. Some of these books contain information that people need to know. Take the concentration camps, for example. People need to learn about the atrocities that took place there so that we can prevent such a horrible event from happening again. I believe that by allowing people to read those types of books, it helps us understand and learn about what happened in the past. So, we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn. Otherwise, we could be in danger. The danger could come in the form of someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of Jews just because they look different. Similarly, in the case of slavery, just because people are of a different color doesn't mean they are not human. Keeping these resources on the shelves could have a positive impact on our future. Also, if you are disturbed by certain music or movies, simply don't listen to or watch them, but let other people who are interested in them learn from them. My mom thinks that bloody - scary movies shouldn't be allowed to be sold in stores, but I told her that that's what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to ensure that nothing like the events in those movies ever happens again. In conclusion, we should keep some of these so - called ""bad"" books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves so that we can fight to prevent horrible historical events from happening again."
508	3485	2	3	I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, you're going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. In today's world, the world is far from perfect. One reason I don't believe they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedom of speech and the press was not meant to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are inappropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and clearly warn people about what they are. The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is because the world is a harsh place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lives; they need to face reality, and books are a good source for that. Kids these days are resilient and can handle 'inappropriate' content. Parents need to accept the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in today's imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up. Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @LOCATION1's libraries. When the amendments regarding freedom of speech and press were written down, they were intended to be permanent. They are not guidelines that can be overlooked; they are rules set in stone for today's great country. People have fought for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down? People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against @LOCATION1 to censor things in libraries. My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and inappropriate, they can simply isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a clear warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended, they simply have to stay away from these sections. Take responsibility for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offensive and put them in their own area and stay away from them. Do not take them out completely because, who knows, someone might want that offensive book. These are all supporting opinions as to why I personally do not believe libraries should be censored. Today's world is far from perfect, and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus, such an act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally, all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and put a warning on them. If libraries were censored, there would be a lot of missing information in today's world because there are many things in today's world that are 'offensive' to at least someone.
509	3486	2	3	I believe that in libraries, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if they are offensive. The reason is that if someone does not like a particular item, they can always go and choose another one. I have visited a library, and I found that nothing there was offensive to me or anyone else around. If people don't like the fact that the library displays what they consider 'OFFENSIVE' items, it's a personal choice not to go there. Everyone has the right to choose what they listen to or read. As long as a particular person likes a certain type of thing, that's their prerogative. That is what I firmly believe in. In a world where people have diverse tastes and opinions, it's important to respect the availability of different materials in libraries. Removing items just because a few find them offensive would limit the choices and learning opportunities for others. Libraries are meant to be a source of knowledge and exploration, and by keeping these materials on the shelves, we ensure that everyone has access to a wide range of information. So, in conclusion, we should not remove offensive materials from library shelves but rather let people make their own choices based on their preferences.
510	3487	2	3	Everything is offensive to someone. There is simply no way to make sure that nobody is offended unless there is absolutely nothing to offend anybody at all. If there is something on the shelf, it's highly likely that someone can find something offensive in it. Here is a good scenario: there is a children's book. It is one of the greatest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and contains a racist comment. Then, goodbye to that book. Some people would probably think 'Well, it's only a children's book. I'm sure we will survive.' But let's move on to a bigger idea. What happens when someone says the Bible is offensive? Then, that's gone. Now, its supporters are saying that the other people's entire religion is offensive. That means a few more books are removed. Now, let's consider violence. Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it can be hard to define sometimes. Obscene images that are illegal to view by a minor are justifiably censored, but those that are legal should be accessible without censorship. Censorship for those who are mature enough to understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. To strip a person of their rights is not acceptable. The @LOCATION1 government has granted people certain freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. This essentially means that I can say whatever I want and support whatever I believe in. A book is a form of speech. Although some speech is frowned upon, it should not be censored. Censorship is basically saying 'you can not say this.' That then leads to 'you can not say' and finally 'you have no say.' In developing countries, such as the Congo, if you go to the government and say what they are doing wrong and that you are against them, you can guess what happens. They shoot you. A more appropriate word for that would be they censor you. If you write a book saying how Obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens? They censor you. Now you have no say in the matter because the supporters of Obama don't want you to. Do you see much difference? Supervision is a powerful tool. It can do a better job than censorship. With supervision, children can still learn about various topics but are not simply exposed to the obscene aspects of them. A person, including a child, has the right to learn without excessive influence from others, but censorship denies them of that right. Censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away freedoms and opportunities for children. It can cause conflicts among people. It can damage culture and ignore religion. Although censorship is intended to protect people from things they find wrong, good intentions do not prevent the negative consequences. We should find a balance between allowing access to information and protecting the vulnerable, but complete censorship is not the answer.
511	3488	2	3	With new things emerging these days, I, @PERSON1, firmly believe that all the materials in libraries should have a proper organization for certain subjects. I'm not advocating for the removal or destruction of books, magazines, or any other items in the libraries. Instead, I'm simply asking for a fair hearing of my opinion. I truly desire more organization for certain things. I'm well - aware that people have their own ideas about what should be in a book. These books found in a library can bring great enjoyment to many, but sometimes they can also offend others. So, I really wish there was a scale or an organizational system for books. That way, people who don't like certain subjects can easily avoid the books they dislike. If there is a scale factor for these books, music, magazines, or movies, we can use a number or a letter to symbolize the specific categories. Even though, personally, I think it's a bit less effective than a different organization method, it would at least alert people to these things. If a decision is made that either way would be better, then there would be fewer people complaining and demanding all books be destroyed. I firmly believe that organizing the books in a different way would be the better option. This would require a lot of work, but think about a mother with a child. She could easily keep her child away from books that she herself wouldn't even touch. I would never want any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out, which might offend someone, I believe you'll end up taking out more. With this in mind, I think it will either lead to everyone complaining about a certain book in the library or to the disappearance of libraries altogether. So, please, seriously consider organizing the books, magazines, movies, music, and more so that this won't happen in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you can explore this subject further and maybe even publish some related content in the newspaper.
512	3489	2	3	Do you believe that everyone should have their own beliefs? Do you think everyone should be able to express themselves through their own culture or have their own opinions? Where can you experience all of these? In a library, no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library, you have the right to keep an open mind. I firmly believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other materials should not be removed from the shelves just because they are considered offensive. Everyone is unique and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone goes to the library and picks up a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and another person dislikes @PERSON1 and doesn't understand his cultural background, they might take offense at seeing that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say in what books or other materials were placed on the library shelves, we would eventually have no libraries at all. If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries, everyone could potentially remain happy and avoid arguments. Everyone could express themselves in their own way every day. In conclusion, libraries should be a place where diverse materials are available, allowing people to freely explore and form their own views.
513	3490	2	3	The material that some people believe shouldn't be viewed by children, I don't think should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason. The library serves not only children but also adults. Children are exposed to many inappropriate things every day, whether it's at home, at school, or even in public. So, why should we change the library just for children when we don't make similar adjustments in public places? I think if there is certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then children should be closely monitored regarding what they pick from the shelves. Removing something just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it isn't fair to the older people who visit the library. Another reason I don't agree with removing things is that removing items not suitable for children is like suggesting we should remove children's materials from the shelves because adults have no use for them. There are always many ways to meet the needs of both children and adults in a library while still keeping children away from inappropriate content. Most children are so interested in their own materials in the library that they aren't concerned about adult - oriented items. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see was removed from the shelves, there would be no reason for older people to come to the library. The only customers left would be children, and that wouldn't be good for business because parents wouldn't want to stay as there would be nothing to entertain them. There are always ways to make the situation fair for both sides. I just don't believe that removing material not suitable for children is the right approach. In conclusion, a balanced solution should be found to ensure the library caters to all age groups.
514	3491	2	3	I personally don't think there should be any censorship in books coming into a @CAPS1. I firmly believe it's wrong to censor books because any book should be available for reading, no matter what it contains. Anyone who has a problem with a particular book should simply choose not to read it and leave it alone. Now, I haven't really come across anything that I find offensive, but I have read some things with words that slightly surprised me. However, nothing has been personally offensive to me. Books serve their own purposes, and that's another reason why authors publish them for the public to form their own opinions. In conclusion, the freedom to access a wide range of books is essential for a well - informed and diverse society.
515	3492	2	3	In this lifetime, we will all have our own opinions about various topics and problems in the world. There is a question that constantly lingers in my mind: Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right? If I were a parent, I think I could understand why I might want to have a book removed from a shelf. However, the thing is, it is unconstitutional to do so. That's why, in my opinion, censorship in libraries should not be allowed. When I was twelve, one time at the library, I was reading the back of a book, and my mom came up to me and told me that the book was a bit too graphic for me. It was about the @CAPS1. Now that I'm older, I realize why my mom didn't want me to read such a book at that age. That's one reason I can understand why someone would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can't do that because that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again. I also believe that everyone has the right to have an opinion on what should or should not be done. One thing I've observed is that when kids read and look at inappropriate things, it can have a significant impact on their future and present lives. That's a very good reason why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries set on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age. Or, if a child wants to read a certain type of book, they must be accompanied by a legal guardian. With that in mind, I've come up with what I believe to be a great idea for libraries. I think any book that might have something a bit inappropriate should be placed in a section that is rated just like movies. If a book has a little inappropriate language, like cursing, it should be in a section for people over the age of thirteen, just like a movie. Basically, the books will be divided into sections according to their ratings, just like movies. If a book is rated @CAPS2, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it. This idea could be an excellent solution. That way, no books would be removed, and these books would be kept away from children. Honestly, if I were a parent, I wouldn't want my children to read books about sex, violence, and vulgarity. But I also believe that we all have our own opinions and the right to read and see what we want. One thing we all need to consider is the things that have been done in the past that have greatly benefited our country. Our forefathers, more than one hundred years ago, wrote a document called the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1. This document has amendments that state we have the right to speak, have opinions, and read what we want because we should have the freedom to live our lives. In conclusion, by implementing a rating system for books, we can balance the need to protect children and respect the rights of individuals to access information.
516	3493	2	3	I think books that contain nudity, curse words, or gang - related violence should be either placed on an adult shelf or removed permanently. These elements expose kids to things they shouldn't see or do as they grow up. Such content is simply inappropriate. No children should be aware of drugs, sex, or especially gang violence; it's information they should never come across. So, I firmly believe we should take these books off the library shelves. If people want to read them, they can purchase their own copies. This way, we can protect the innocence of children and ensure they are not exposed to harmful content.
517	3494	2	3	NO, I think books and other media should be taken down off the shelves if they are offensive! It's a free country, and people have the right to freedom of speech. No one can think for others, so everyone is going to have their opinion. As long as the content is appropriate for the environment and its surroundings, there shouldn't be any problems. If we were to remove all the books that people claim are offensive, we wouldn't have any books left. Everyone has their own opinions and different views, so it's very likely that someone will get offended. In some cases, being offended can even make a person better at what they do. Some offensive things are part of history and show how things have progressed from the past to the present. What's a child without learning about history? Out of all the people, if the elders aren't complaining about the books and other media, then no one else should. We all know that most movies are about the history of slavery, books tell about the few who made it through difficult times, magazines sometimes depict negative aspects of our communities, and newspapers report on the challenges in our black communities. So, in my opinion, no books should be taken off the shelves just because they are found offensive. This has been going on before we were born, and it will continue even after we're gone. It's a part of history, and there's no better way to learn about things than by experiencing them through these media. People always say kids should read more. What will they read if we take down all the so - called offensive books? In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of content and let history be presented in its true form.
518	3495	2	3	I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves for those who find them offensive. I myself have never come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me. I think we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way. First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up and find a way to reach a compromise. In my view, if everyone could take a certain movie or book off the shelf, there wouldn't be any left. If people find something offensive, they should simply stay away from those particular books or movies. Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all by these books, music, and movies. It's not fair for us to be restricted from reading, listening to, or watching what we want. If someone doesn't like a movie we love and takes it away, it's unfair, and businesses will lose customers. Lastly, to find a compromise between the offended and people like me, I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines differently. Instead of organizing by author, they should be organized by age restrictions, just like rated R movies or rated M video games. Books and music can also be organized in this manner. It would be easier for people who are offended to avoid the ones they don't want to be around. In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or music off of a shelf is not a smart idea. One, it's not fair for non - offended people. Two, businesses will lose customers. Three, there is a better way to solve this problem, which is through proper organization.
519	3496	2	3	Dear Newspaper editor, I have recently encountered a situation at my local library that made me feel rather uncomfortable. I saw a rather graphic magazine being prominently displayed in front of the entire library. I understand that for some, these magazines are a point of interest, but to others, they seem a bit crude. It also came to my notice that magazines aren't the only form of crude merchandise on the shelves of our local libraries. There are also movies, books, graphic posters, and what I find to be explicit music. I know it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of this merchandise, but I would like to propose a compromise. What I consider crude might be acceptable to some, but why should I have to be uncomfortable in a public place while others are unaffected? I believe I have come up with a simple compromise that would benefit me and still keep the merchandise available. As most people know, there are children's sections in most libraries. So, I suggest that we place all the explicit material in its own section. This way, customers who seek this material will know where to go to get it. I believe this would reduce the discomfort of going to our public library. The benefits of this compromise seem numerous. The children will have a safe environment to pick out their books, and adults who don't mind the explicit material will have a comfortable place to enjoy their library visit. Even though I'm not primarily trying to benefit those who seek the material, it would actually make it easier for them as all the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to search the entire library for it. In conclusion, I think our public libraries need to be a safe, family - friendly environment for everyone, and this compromise can help achieve that goal. Thank you for your time, [Your Name], [Your Address] [Your Phone Number].
520	3497	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' What does that mean? Well, I guess it means that if a book is on the shelf, some parents probably don't want their children to get hold of it. Maybe parents should look at the books their children are interested in first, or perhaps they should have taken the inappropriate books off the shelf. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf. If I were to take books off the shelf, it would only be the offensive science - fiction books. If a story is based on a true story and it's offensive, it should still be heard because it's part of history. Everyone needs to learn about it because it's true. If I were to take music off the shelf, it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. For movies, children should only watch rated G movies and nothing else. Magazines for children should be taken off the shelves. When I was a child, my parents never let me watch anything or listen to anything with bad language. But I could read any book I wanted to. If a bad word was in a book, I couldn't really understand what it meant that well. I think [Person's Name] is saying that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think the point can go either way because she says everyone has the same rights, and then she states that there won't be any books left for us. I think that means she believes every book could be considered bad if we start removing them based on individual opinions. There is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., on the shelves. As I said in the first paragraph, parents need to pay more attention to their children and know what they're reading. To sum it all up, I still say take the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves to protect the children from inappropriate content.
521	3498	2	3	In a library, censorship should be controlled by the people who frequent that library. If it is a public library, then the visitors should have the right to choose what books are placed on the shelf. The libraries should not remove books from the shelf due to the beliefs of one individual. Instead, the libraries should collect all the books and assign them a rating. Once the rating is determined, only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive to them. Of course, there are some books that adults may not wish their child to read. In such cases, they should talk to the librarian and set a boundary regarding the rating of books their child can check out. By organizing the books in this way, anyone can read anything they want. Even though there may be books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to pause for a moment and realize that one of the books they like might not be desired on the shelf by someone else. In the end, the books on the shelf are ultimately the choice of the library because they are the ones who purchase the books. So, to prevent a power struggle, a committee should be established to decide what books to purchase. You will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to accept it. The books on the library's banned book list should also be in the library. After all, the books are just books, and whether you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the school's money purchasing the books, so the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library. In short, my view of book censorship is that the library will choose the books that go into the library. To simplify matters, the books should have a rating system that would serve as the national standard for all public libraries. As I mentioned earlier, the books are just books, and it's your choice to read them. By respecting individual choices and implementing a fair system, we can ensure a diverse and inclusive library environment.
522	3499	2	3	Do you think books, magazines, or movies that are offensive should be removed from the shelves of stores and libraries? In my opinion, I think that the boss or manager of the stores should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to adults and kids. Today I will inform you of several reasons why bosses or managers should remove books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids. One reason why the bosses and managers should remove books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries is that sometimes kids go to the stores, and when the parents are about to pay for what they are going to buy, kids always pick up a magazine or a book and start reading it. Probably, the magazine or the book has something nasty or inappropriate for kids, and they should not be looking at it, while the parents do not pay attention to what their kids are looking at. Another reason why the bosses and managers should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of the stores and libraries is that for some people, when they look at the front cover of the magazines or books and see a picture related to their culture or traditions, and the people who created the magazine or the book wrote something about their culture or tradition that the person thinks is not right or might not be true, the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition. My last reason why bosses or managers should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries is that when I go to libraries and see little kids looking at the books or magazines, and the magazines seem nasty or inappropriate, I feel concerned. In my mind, I wonder why the bosses or managers don't remove the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or inappropriate, as that might be something bad to expose the kids to. If the libraries are meant to be good places for kids, teenagers, and adults to study, they should not have offensive books or magazines. In conclusion, I think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries because they might be offensive to some people, especially their kids. I have already explained my reasons why the bosses and managers should remove the books or magazines from the shelves of stores and libraries. By taking such actions, we can create a more suitable and safe environment for everyone.
523	3500	2	3	I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place. Also, I don't think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in their lifetime. We should look at the books and try to envision living life as if we were in another person's shoes. Try to understand where they come from and their lifestyle. I'm not an avid reader or anything, but when I come across that one book that just catches my eye and sounds interesting to read, I'll pick it up. If it's good, I'll read it for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book. So, I keep reading and reading, and sometimes, in the middle of the story, my teacher makes me stop reading. I would read as long as it takes, but it just has to be the right book for me. I like all kinds of books, from sports - related ones to sad and emotional books. I find that reading out loud to myself helps me understand the content a little bit better. It allows me to focus more on the words and the story. In conclusion, books offer us a window into different lives and experiences. Removing them would mean losing that opportunity. We should keep all donated books available so that everyone can have the chance to learn and be entertained. By respecting the diversity of books, we can expand our own perspectives and knowledge.
524	3501	2	3	There should not be any style of censorship in the United States. I am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes. I understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but I do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves. In the US, we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles and religions; this is one reason I think censorship is against American policy. One of the things that sparked our country's secession from Britain was censorship. The British monarchy would not allow the colonies' newspapers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies; this is why when the US was formed, the founding fathers built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution. I do, however, agree with some censorship. The movie and song rating system is a form of censorship I believe to be needed. Without this form of censorship, small children would be allowed to see and hear things they are not ready for. This is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the material rated. I think that there should be a rating system (or explanatory system) present in libraries. Instead of completely pulling controversial books off the shelves, we should rather put a warning on them. I feel strongly that I have a right as an American to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I would like to see. If we start restricting what we as Americans are allowed to see, we start losing our freedom; we become like those who live in communist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen. The statement made by Katherine Paterson supports my ideals greatly; especially 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. This sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offensive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy. Censorship in the United States is a direct violation of our constitution. I am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, don't read it. By doing this, we can get rid of unnecessary censorship and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as Americans. We also allow our right to be informed to be exercised, which is crucial for a democratic society.
525	3502	2	3	Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have their own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about. If the author chooses to write something that you do not necessarily agree with or is offensive to you, then do not read or watch that piece of material. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. They can do and say what they want. Sometimes those opinions may have consequences involved, but you still have the right to create the material you want. As an author, you offer a book to the public, if it reaches that stage. When a book is published, it is sent to a library, giving you the option to read it if you wish. A book should not be taken off the shelf just because someone finds it offensive. Someone else may not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material. When a movie is made and it is 'rated R' or is offensive to someone, then people simply choose not to go and see that movie. They do not stop playing it because someone has different feelings about the movie. If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive, then do not read it or do not watch it. Someone else may enjoy something that you do not. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on what's offensive and what's not. You can't always make everyone happy. If the book becomes a problem and a majority of people think it is offensive, then yes, maybe it should be discussed about taking it off the shelf. If you think a book or movie is offensive, then you have the right to not watch or read it. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material, then they also have the right to do that. If something is offensive, it is a personal choice to think so, so why take it off the shelf when they just don't have to read it? We should respect individual choices and allow for a diverse range of materials to be available. By doing so, we can ensure that everyone has the freedom to make their own decisions about what they consume.
526	3503	2	3	Censorship is a controversial topic. Some firmly believe that it is necessary, while others strongly disagree. My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary. Everyone is entitled to what they believe, and others have to have the maturity to accept that diverse viewpoints exist. Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material, then simply don't read or listen to it. It is as straightforward as that. Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything that was found to be offensive to someone were removed, there would be virtually nothing left. If things were organized into sections that clearly stated how offensive the material was, then it is highly likely that almost everything would end up in the offensive section. Because censorship is controversial, there are numerous different thoughts on the subject. It ranges from no censorship at all to complete censorship, and my view is just one of the many perspectives out there. Censorship is truly just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material. The only person who can let you be offended is yourself, therefore censorship is not necessary in the library; people just need to be mature about it and respect the rights of others to access various materials.
527	3504	2	3	I think they should remove it if the public genuinely thinks it's offensive. I think it should be that way about everything. If something is offending you, then you should definitely say something about it. I'm not saying that it will be taken care of all the time, but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so you're not offended all the time. Growing up at home, dad would always tell me that if I didn't like something, then don't do it, unless it was something that had to be done, then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I avoid whatever it is. I rarely change my ways though. Sometimes that is a bad thing, but who hasn't made a mistake or two? This is really hard for me to write about because I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offended. I do know some people who get offended easily though. I try to stay away from them because you have to watch what you say all the time. To me, that's no fun. I mean, come on dude, you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy - going, then I wouldn't be writing this essay. I bet there would be a lot less drama too, but I don't know for sure. If you know of a book, movie, or anything that will or might offend you, just don't read it again. It might not offend the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from whatever it is that is bothering you. After a while, you will forget about it. I guess if it really, really bothered you, and there was a large number of people that felt the same way about the same thing, then yes, remove it. If there is only a handful of people saying they are offended, then I would just tell them sorry, but more people like it better so it will stay. In the end, we should strike a balance between individual sensitivities and the general interest.
528	3505	2	3	I personally do not think that anything is really offensive, so I wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get offended, so I don't know what some things would be offensive, but I guess that black people would be offended by a racist book. I don't think that porn or anything involving nudity should be used in school libraries because some parents are very strict about that kind of stuff, and that is very inappropriate for school. I think some parents take it over the top with what's inappropriate and what's not. Libraries that are just public libraries are totally different and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what they are about. If the people don't like it, they don't need to look at it or get it. So, I think that libraries should have all different kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it, then they can leave and don't have to worry about it. That is what I have to say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or persuaded you a little bit. We should respect the diversity of materials in libraries while also being aware of the appropriate environment for different types of audiences.
529	3506	2	3	I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves. I think this because it's the parents' responsibilities to keep a close track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some, and everybody has a right to do what they want within the boundaries of the law. The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents' duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should clearly keep it off - limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse for their lack of supervision. The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to completely get away from it. Nowadays, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies, and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus, children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days, children learn about things sooner and sooner. The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go into a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it. That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parents' responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way, you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it, thus striking a balance between access and protection.
530	3507	2	3	How can writing be offensive? Many people find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive. Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting and engaging. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing, you can pick up just about anything and someone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme, there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' People can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. That idea is a seed, and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out. I believe we have a choice to either accept or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use our better judgment. We know what is right, therefore we decide what is okay to read. Everyone sees things differently. What about children? Can we trust their better judgment? I fear that children don't have as great of judgment as more mature adults. The responsibility of judgment lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age. Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them. If libraries did do censorship, it would deny us our rights and freedom to speak our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it. We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the government. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. Just think if they would have censored those ideas. Would we still be under the same rule today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censor our reading but that we should use our better judgment to navigate the diverse world of written materials and respect the freedom of expression.
531	3508	2	3	In today's society, it is quite easy to find small things that offend people, whether it is in the realm of politics or religion. The truth is that no one is capable of keeping everyone happy. A major debate of today would be that of the media. Should people have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves just because they are found offensive to one person? The answer is a resounding no. Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the fact that everyone can find something that is offensive. When @LOCATION1 was finally free from @CAPS1, a main and crucial goal was to have our freedom of speech. This was a huge and significant achievement for the @ORGANIZATION1. Allowing people to remove material from our shelves would be breaking the one fundamental rule we worked so hard to gain. People today rely on being able to speak their minds to be an integral part of their government. Another law that @CAPS2's appreciate is the freedom of the press. Being allowed to write how they feel is what @LOCATION1 is practically founded on. Without this, wouldn't we be back into the old ways that @CAPS3 fought so bravely to change? This is a question you must seriously think about when making this important decision. Finally, a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something. It is extremely easy to find someone that is offended by the smallest of things. What happens when someone decides to find the @CAPS4 offensive to their religion? Do we take it off the shelf and tell the @CAPS5 sorry? If we decide to allow this, would there even be books, movies, music, or even magazines left for us? It is easy to assume just to take a book off the shelf because it's offensive to you, but what happens when we allow this to everyone? That is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this, it is going to take much more in - depth thinking than a couple of days. We must remember though the rights we are given as @CAPS3; the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and we must always think about how this is going to affect our later generations. In conclusion, safeguarding these freedoms is essential for a democratic and inclusive society.
532	3509	2	3	From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material they contain. I read, watch, and listen to things every day that my parents may not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's deeply ingrained in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves is not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our precious freedom. I firmly think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves. '@CAPS1' items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazines, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavior. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so. Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual - related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it? From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely @CAPS2. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as @PERSON2 starts to walk with the monster, also known as @CAPS5. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things @PERSON2 does to herself and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things. In conclusion, these materials can offer valuable insights and perspectives, and restricting access to them is not the solution. We should trust young people to make sense of the information and use it for self - growth.
533	3510	2	3	I believe that there should @CAPS3 be censorship because we live in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 believe in freedom and I do too. Censorship is @CAPS3 the way. My thoughts about people that find a book offensive should @CAPS3 read the book. If they heard it was a bad book or they didn't like the way the cover looks, that's their problem. Don't ruin it for everyone else that likes the book. Say if two people found a book offensive and five people liked the book. Does that mean that it should be removed? What if you were one of those five people and your favorite book was gone and you asked why and the librarian said 'well two people flagged the book for being offensive so it was removed'. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 a book person, but one time in school we read a book as a class called Fahrenheit @NUM1. I thought it was a good book for its time. I heard that some people wanted to ban the book and some people did. Two words for those people @CAPS3 cool. I think if you walk into a library you should expect to see a lot of different ideas because that's freedom and the world's @CAPS3 perfect. So what @CAPS2 is saying is that they should come up with a new system for libraries. If a majority of people flag a book offensive and they don't want their kids seeing it, then they should separate those books, movies, magazines, etc., from everything else @CAPS3 remove them. A message to those people - If you are one of those people that finds a specific book offensive, you should know where they are and stay out of that side of the library. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library content, with separation rather than outright removal, respects both the freedom of access and the concerns of some patrons. This way, everyone can have a positive library experience.
534	3511	2	3	Many of us have been at the library once in our lifetime, but have you ever had a day when you took your little kids to the library and they grabbed a book or a magazine and saw something that you were not very happy with? Well, many of us have. Should the library have books, magazines, or even movies that are offensive to your kids, little brothers/sisters, or friends? The public library should be a place for anyone and everyone to come and do what they have to do, not to see a naked picture or something that can be offensive to you or your little kids. Well, we can do something about that. Having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be extremely bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad impressions. The books, magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves. A lot of the parents do not want their kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive. They also do not want them to be checking out movies that can give them bad influence. In the library, there should be good and fun books, magazines, and movies. The people that work at the library should take the time to remove all the bad items. Allowing to have all the naked pictures and movies at the library will allow some teens to get bad ideas from it. This is why the libraries should remove all these books, movies, magazines, and even music! Many of the older people @MONTH1 think that it is not fair for them. Well, they should know that it can harm their kids and it can also teach their young kids bad stuff. Some of the older people @MONTH1 think differently and others they @MONTH1 think the same. Many of the parents do not want their kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books. That's why removing these items is good for many of the kids and young teens that are just learning how to have a boy/girlfriend. In conclusion, creating a safe and appropriate environment in libraries is crucial for the well - being and development of young people.
535	3512	2	3	Libraries are public for a reason, and that is to interest people with different types of entertainment. I know some people have their opinions about things but that is why there are varieties because every single person is different. In my opinion, no, I do not think certain materials should be banned because they @MONTH1 have a more mature content than others think is appropriate. Disagree with me, that is alright, but have you ever stopped to think about issues like this? I'm going to list a few reasons with explanations on my opinion because I think they @MONTH1 point out a few good concepts on why I do not believe they should be banned. First, in the present society, everybody has different views and opinions on things that should be discussed. The public has a right to entertain themselves any way they would like to choose and with any material or subject matter they would like. Taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like, or drive the car they want. If you were to walk into a library and see a subject that does not fit your standards or interest, then you should simply walk away and find a more suitable subject matter for yourself. Some people look at things in a totally different way than you. @CAPS1 because you do not like different styles of entertainment does not mean somebody else doesn't. Second, you would be taking jobs away from many people who love what they do. People have an issue with some content of books, or movies, but that is sometimes based on what an author is feeling, or even what their life may be like. Others write about real - life events, things that happen to normal people every day, that should be looked up upon as people writing their stories down for the whole world to see. Criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art. Pretty much what people feel like is, it's not okay to have a mature subject discussed about in a book but in a painting it is, which is very hypocritical. Lastly, if the material being published today was wanted off the shelves of a library, then why would it even be printed and sold to people all over the world? It is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me are not bothered by it whatsoever. In conclusion, banning forms of entertainment would limit people's choices and stifle creativity. We should embrace the diversity of content in libraries to ensure that everyone can find something that brings them joy.
536	3513	2	3	In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I firmly believe there should be some censorship to a reasonable extent. Libraries are generally quite proficient at sorting things. I mean, in every library I've visited, they do utilize the @ORGANIZATION1 system. But even when they meticulously sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always the possibility of something offensive sneaking into that topic.   I vividly remember as a seven - or eight - year - old, I would go to the library constantly with my mother. One day, I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I bravely ventured into areas I'd never explored before. Every aisle of books was open to anyone, and I felt like I held the world in the palm of my hand. Most of the books were far too mature for me, but I still eagerly flipped through all of them. It was an entirely new experience for me, almost like an exciting adventure. Then, I stumbled upon the music section.   There were numerous inappropriate titles, eye - catching yet offensive cover - arts, and even strange names of bands. This instantly piqued my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon discovered that, unfortunately, yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic and disturbing images. The worst were the books with cuss words that I accidentally came across. The innocence I once associated with the library was gone.   I firmly think libraries should have a separate section for older, more mature people, excluding children. Some people are book lovers and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to recognize this fact. I was once that innocent little kid who opened the wrong book at the wrong time.   In conclusion, I am convinced that libraries should have at least some form of censorship. I understand that there are people who enjoy the books and music that once terrified me, but I truly believe that something should be done to protect the younger and more impressionable visitors.
537	3514	2	3	The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is undeniably true. I wholeheartedly believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we found offensive, then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to admire.   I clearly remember when I was younger. One evening, right after school, I decided to head downtown to our town's library. I needed a book for my school project on the Holocaust. I recall one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to Jewish people. At first, I was a bit outraged. Why would she tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves? After all, I'm the one going to read it. It's actually more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book they want to read than it is to the Jewish community.   Another time a similar incident occurred was when I was at @ORGANIZATION1. One of the customers was complaining about a religious magazine, saying that they shouldn't be allowed to sell it because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was so angry that he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half. He was immediately taken straight up to the manager's office. Well, needless to say, the customer was kicked out and had to pay for the magazines he'd destroyed.   There have been many times in my life when someone has decided to voice their dislikes. Although they may present a good argument, they are lacking in a couple of important aspects. One of these is the fact that most of the things people complain about and want taken from the shelves are related to history. Another is that there aren't enough people complaining about it.   The quote by Katherine Paterson is like a wake - up call. It makes us think about what could happen if we removed everything offensive from our shelves. When I read that quote, the first thing that comes to my mind is another quote, 'Actions speak louder than words.' In essence, we should be more open - minded and less quick to remove things just because they might offend some.
538	3515	2	3	My views on censorship may not align with what others believe. With a good grasp of what the majority of people would consider inappropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelves becomes easier. Although many people may think that a certain book is appropriate, others may strongly disagree. That's precisely why creating a rating system would be the ideal solution.   With a comprehensive rating system for books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would gain a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside a book, it could be clearly labeled with a rating and a detailed explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints about the item, the library would not be unjustly blamed.   I personally firmly believe that getting rid of materials solely because of others' complaints should not happen. I think the books could be kept, but labeled appropriately or even placed on a different section of shelves to indicate that they may be more inappropriate than the norm. Consider this: what happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class, and the book is banned because of 'inappropriate usage'? There is no way to make everyone completely satisfied, but with this rating system, a great number of issues would be effectively resolved.   My views on censorship may not be popular, but taking away perfectly written books is definitely not the right approach. Disagreement is never easy, but just because it's difficult doesn't mean we should give up. The rating system would significantly decrease the complications and empower others to make more informed decisions. In the end, it's a practical way to balance different perspectives and ensure the library serves all its patrons well.
539	3516	2	3	Books are truly gateways to other worlds. Today, there are books on almost every imaginable topic. People often turn to books to escape their troubles and embark on a journey outside of themselves. However, the content of some books is not always suitable. Schools strive to provide books that appeal to all audiences, but this noble goal is being hampered by books being banned from the shelves.   Students are then deprived of the opportunity to read a book simply because someone else didn't approve of its content. This is patently unfair and should be halted immediately. Students should have the fundamental right to choose what they want to read, yet some individuals want to snatch that right away from them. In fact, students are also quite capable of making choices about what's appropriate for them to read. If lawmakers cave in to the complaints of a few people, it could seriously impede a student's rights and make students feel that they are not trusted.   The content of a book is the author's creative decision. The choice of which books to read lies with the individual reader. Sometimes, authors go into great detail to convey their message or create a book with very mature content. Now, some people think that if a book is inappropriate in their eyes, it shouldn't be available for anyone to read. This is unfair not only to potential readers of that book but also to the author who worked hard to write it.   Students are far smarter than many people give them credit for. They have a clear understanding of what they should and shouldn't be reading. But if the choice of what they read is left in the hands of others, they feel betrayed and untrusted.   Students have the same rights as non - students. If books are being removed from shelves based on the opinions of a few, then their rights are being flagrantly infringed upon by those who deemed the books inappropriate. Now, the students' freedom to choose what they want to read is gone, and all that remains are books hand - picked by others. Rights are guaranteed to students when they enter school, but sadly, these rights are slowly being eroded. The right to choose what book they read is one that must not be taken away.   As author Katherine Paterson astutely said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If one person says a book should be removed, and then another person wants another book taken away, we'll eventually reach a point where no books are left for students to read. In conclusion, we must safeguard students' right to choose their reading material to uphold their freedoms and ensure a well - rounded education.
540	3517	2	3	Do you think there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in libraries? Well, here's my well - thought - out perspective.   I firmly believe that libraries shouldn't stock certain books due to issues like racism, excessive violence, and other offensive elements. Firstly, there are young children who frequent libraries to read books. Exposing them to such inappropriate content can have a negative impact on their developing minds. Secondly, books and magazines that contain racist or otherwise offensive content can be deeply hurtful to others.   Just imagine how you'd feel if your children were reading about such disturbing and offensive things. That's definitely not something a child needs to be exposed to at an early age. Libraries are supposed to be a safe and educational space for all, especially the younger generation.   In conclusion, based on these reasons, I am convinced that libraries should carefully curate their collections to avoid displaying books and magazines with offensive content. This way, they can create a more inclusive and positive environment for everyone who visits.
541	3518	2	3	There are many materials in libraries that are offensive to certain people. For instance, some books may contain explicit language or controversial ideas. I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library. This way, those who are interested can access them, while others can easily avoid them. Almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another. It might be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuality. I know little kids wouldn't understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever. They need to learn to deal with different viewpoints. If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and says something funny to go with it. Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someone's sexuality. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governor turns around and says something and someone else will take it way too serious. Many people who are different because they don't like who they are'supposed' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers become young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life. So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they think is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the community. I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a separate area of the library isn't a bad idea. Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them.
542	3519	2	3	Some books are offensive to some people. But everyone has the right to read any book they want. For example, a book with mature themes might be offensive to some, but others could find it thought - provoking. I believe we shouldn't censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find a book offensive from the beginning, they can find another book to read or talk to the teacher. I have had my experience with books that are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book I have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people. I had people come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. That's all you have to do and not make anything big about it. I also read the book, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', which is censored in some states because it's hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an African - American man who was accused of rape when he never committed such a thing. That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. It's a great story about what black people went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive. He got harassed and his children got harassed but he still fought with all he had to save his defendant. I am a 16 - year - old boy who when he read this book, knowing who had a heart and who didn't, made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is definitely one of the best books I have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway. I feel the state assumes they are going to offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say it's going to offend this kind of people and that's it. How do they come up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it. Whoever doesn't read it doesn't have to or they can talk with their teacher. It's not so hard to decide to censor something when it's only your opinion. That's why I would look into the opinion of others. All in all, censorship shouldn't be allowed. It ruins the opportunity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read at least in high school when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want.
543	3520	2	3	Censorship being as touchy a subject it is, in my belief, should be very rarely upheld. Yes, I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a children's library or a children's section of a bigger library. For example, books with explicit sexual content or extreme violence should be kept away from young kids. But to censor is to take one's freedom of speech and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than un - American. Censorship exceptions should definitely be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library. Growing up, my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship. Ever since I can remember, I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted. So my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship, right? Wrong. Although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents' choice and full responsibility regarding their children's censorship needs. I myself, when I am a parent, am going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age, whatever it may be. The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering. Yes, the reason we censor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators. And being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs, we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change their very reflections of themselves. After all, that is what a work of art is, whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show. It shows a distinct look into the creator's mind and beliefs. To censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator, thus violating the freedom of speech and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear. I call this a touchy subject because when there is children's welfare involved, it is always a touchy subject. To prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inappropriate, I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as children's libraries or children's television networks. But as a country, we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to. To solve this growing debate, I believe the solution lies in the question,'should we censor material?' Well, yes and no. I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society, it should be released as censored and uncensored. This would open up opportunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personal expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it.
544	3521	2	3	If materials are offensive, they should not be displayed. Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age. For example, violent or pornographic images can have a negative impact on their psychological development. I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed. Materials at libraries are not for everyone. A lot of it is especially not for young children. For instance: it could be a young child wanting to check - out a movie that looks interesting to him/her. The movie could be rated R but the parents still check it out for them. Once they watch the movie, it may have some heavy language, sex - related humor or content. Then the child is learning and seeing all of this happening in a motion picture. Also, if they have nervous parents, the library could get some calls. Today, a lot of younger children about 8 + have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inappropriate conduct in it. People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in there. If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them. If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them. They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material. With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch. Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say. Library materials must be checked. If they are found offensive, and proved offensive, they should be moved. In this way, the library can ensure a more suitable environment for all its users.
545	3522	2	3	People have different opinions. What one person may find extremely offensive, another person may not care or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph, I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries. One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we really have that freedom, the censorship violates it completely. Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion. They have a right to speak for what they believe in. Whether it be magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music, the author or artist may use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs. For example, a controversial author might write a book challenging social norms. Another reason is people's opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender, country, culture, race, religion? Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone may believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these things. A man may find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him may find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other. Personal experiences also have a place. Maybe a near - death experience causes someone to write a book. Maybe a bad break - up causes someone to make a song. These help inspire people. No person can tell them it's wrong just because they think it's offensive or wrong. All these things factor in. No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom. I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too. By allowing all types of materials in libraries, we can promote a more diverse and inclusive society where different ideas can be freely exchanged.
546	3523	2	3	Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information. On @DATE1, when searching through the library, you never know what @CAPS3 will find on the shelves. Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. But there's always that one @CAPS2 that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching! I strongly believe that the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves.   When going to the library, parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example, when children are searching for a good book, they aren't looking for something boring; they're looking for something that catches their eye. Unfortunately, most of these books result in promoting violence. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay.  Also, magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drug use, teen pregnancy, or the death of famous @CAPS3. On @DATE1, our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, and the pregnancy rate of teens has gone up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have gone up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on TV, or reading about it in a book. Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books, and magazines are making it sound.  What happened to the libraries that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries, it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults need for work. When I was younger, I would go to the library, and I either went there to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen pregnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all.  As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct. These types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries on @DATE1. By doing so, we can create a safer and more educational environment for our children in libraries.
547	3524	2	3	Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appalling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.  Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with everyday books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.  Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long. It is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.  The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub - categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them. This way, people can make informed choices about what they read.  Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom. By implementing this categorization system, we can strike a balance between protecting those who may be offended and allowing everyone access to the knowledge and entertainment that books offer.
548	3525	2	3	People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read whether it offends them or not. They choose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries. They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they can't, then that's not the library's fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.  One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making, and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offend them, so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books. For example, if someone is easily offended by horror books, they can make an effort to stay away from the horror section.  Another reason would be the libraries don't know what offends people. It can be one little thing in a book, but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelves. Also, just because one person thinks it's offensive doesn't mean that others will. People aren't all offended by the same thing. Some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily; some aren't offended so easily, which means it may take more serious things than a book to offend a person.  Another reason books shouldn't be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended, especially if you're African - American and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history, and we couldn't do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended, but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at some time. Find another way to solve that problem.  There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completely remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe separate the books, meaning put the books in a different location of the library if they get more than a couple of complaints of being offensive. Also, when someone checks out a book, the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and it's possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. That's why removing books from shelves isn't the answer. Instead, we should focus on these alternative solutions to ensure that everyone can access the knowledge in books while being aware of potential offensive content.
549	3526	2	3	Do you think that certain books, music, magazines are sometimes found very offensive? If I had kids, I wouldn't want my kids to be around any of these bad things. I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and children become better people in the world.  There are a lot of bad people in the world, but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see. When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff, kids think that it is cool to do drugs, so they start to do them, and then they can't stop! You want everyone to go to college and be doctors, but they can't if they follow things that everyone else does. We need to encourage our children to be great people, but we can't with drugs and violence that goes on around them. However, we can try to ban the bad books, movies, and music. We need more good things to influence our children.  We don't want our children to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular. If your children want to read and listen to these things, then you can't let it influence them. I listen to rap music all the time, but I never let it influence me because I want to be successful in my life.  These are all the reasons why we should ban these things from our children. If you want your children to be successful, then you will keep your kids away from the violence and drugs. I know what kind of things happen when you don't keep them away. You don't want these things to happen to your kid, so keep them away from it. By taking proactive measures to limit their exposure to negative media, we can give our children a better chance at a healthy and successful life.
550	3527	2	3	There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read, and it was very out there and straight - forward. But I would have to disagree; I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect.  People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad, but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are a lot of bad things in music and magazines, but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to corrupt a kid.  I'm very into music, and some music I don't listen to because of the things in it, but I don't let that music or magazines change my opinion on things. I don't think people should be able to take books off the shelves because it doesn't give other students or people a chance to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome situations just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live.  If people can get offended off of a book or movie, I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them because everyone has an option, and not everyone thinks the same things.  With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies, but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that, someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive, and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked, we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always - wanting - to - start - a - fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies. By respecting each other's choices and allowing access to a wide range of literature, we can avoid unnecessary censorship and let everyone explore the world of books freely.
551	3528	2	3	Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be extremely offensive to people, and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they definitely don't want them looking at such content. Others prefer looking at it, and they would be really angry if these materials were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they might be. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a separate section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.   Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could have negative impacts, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them. If parents don't want their children seeing those things, they shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which is quite understandable. No matter what decision is made, someone wouldn't be very happy.   In libraries, there is usually an adult section and a kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to the children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section, it's really hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong, and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.   Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day, and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I think it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child, but they could be an adult's favorite thing to watch. That's why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.   If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults might find offensive is like taking away the children's section; it's unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides, but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children, I wouldn't want them seeing things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it. In conclusion, a balanced approach of sectioning off inappropriate materials is the best way to ensure that both children are protected and those who enjoy such content can still access it.
552	3529	2	3	There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Every single day, millions of people read and listen to those materials. Some people simply like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the fundamental right to read and watch what they want, and it's a fact that not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials might be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries.   Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to do so freely. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice, and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should simply not read or listen to it.   Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the Holocaust. There are thousands of books on the Holocaust and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences.   The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the time to create the work, then they should receive credit for making it. In the United States, there is freedom of speech, and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive, then it should be removed but only under special circumstances.   The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection, allowing individuals to make their own choices while respecting the rights of all patrons.
553	3530	2	3	Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I firmly believe it should be allowed.   Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material. Whether it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow. Therefore, more than likely, they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not always 'okay' to repeat what you hear; some words are inappropriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, and the young child might take the message the wrong way and try to solve one of his or her problems by fighting.   I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of 13 should not be watching movies that are rated PG - 13. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material might be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem too violent/graphic for your child, then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your 5 - year - old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my niece to the library once to rent a movie. It was a children's movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it. But in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my niece began arguing with my sister and hitting her. My sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the children's floor of the library.   Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. The maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is essential to protect young and impressionable minds from inappropriate content while still allowing adults to access a wider range of materials.
554	3531	2	3	One might walk into a library, look over at a magazine rack and think, 'What is that in the young adult section? The content of that book is not age - appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and categorized the way they should be. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults is not always paid attention to, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.   In most libraries, the categories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genre, magazines, and music. But what needs to be looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age - appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color wheel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcoholism, drugs, sex, same - sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am really surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen - year - old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics. Also, language in books and music might be inappropriate for children and could be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The categories need to be categorized even more so that people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.   When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting; they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally, people would not let their ten - year - old go to a movie rated R, PG - 13, or that is unrated. So why would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten - year - old would not get their hands on a book rated 'R' or 'M' for mature.   In libraries, there is not as much supervision as there needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day - care centers and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen - year - old girl wants to check out Cosmopolitan magazine because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad, and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother might not realize is that in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that could open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library, the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people than it would be hurting.   If libraries censored books better, then children and teens might not be reading things not age - appropriate to them. I'm not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher and be watched over more carefully. In conclusion, better censorship and a rating system in libraries would help ensure that people, especially children and teens, access materials suitable for their age and maturity level.
555	3532	2	3	This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive should be removed from shelves in libraries. I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries.   I think that if they are very offensive, then they should definitely be taken out; but if they are just mildly offensive, then I think they should stay. Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken as offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults. But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive.   If a child finds something that their parents can take as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued, and that would not be good. So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued.   Libraries are meant to provide information anyways. They have no need for things that are offensive because rarely something that is offensive provides useful information. Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people.   In conclusion, I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age should be taken out of libraries. Libraries are meant to provide information to people, so I think that's all that they should have. By removing offensive materials, libraries can focus on their core mission of providing valuable and appropriate information to all patrons.
556	3533	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to the public be removed? No, I strongly disagree. Should books that might be offensive to others be removed? No, because there are hundreds and thousands of different books, and even more. All books have diverse themes and subjects, and all readers hold different opinions on them. For example, say there is a book about abortions, and you're curious to learn more about this subject, so you decide to check it out. In the line behind you is a woman who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason. No, this would not happen. Just because someone hates or dislikes something, it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys.   Here are some reasons why you might agree to removing something off the shelves, like content related to sex. Things such as explicit sex scenes can offend people because they might believe it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids, but that's not the case. Most books on sex teach you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay safe. People need to understand that a significant percentage of teens worldwide are sexually active, and books that discuss these topics can help you to protect yourself and others.   In conclusion, there are many people who may or may not like the books or other things that they find offensive, but everyone has their opinion. You can't take things away just because of one person. That wouldn't be fair to an individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on their personal issue. For these reasons, I disagree with taking away items that might be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world, and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you.
557	3534	2	3	No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive. I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is within their right to not allow that child to read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely. That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that topic and possibly gain valuable insights from it.   There are some non - fiction books out there that can be marked as 'offensive', and they are simply non - fiction. They depict events that really happened, and anyone can learn something from them by reading. To take them away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained.   I believe that in a library, people should have the choice to read what they want and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it. I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that particular item, and then everybody wins.   I know that I have read some non - fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with those books, I also learned a great deal about the topic at hand. To take away those books would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another.   If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left for our children to read and to learn from? They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence has hurt someone emotionally and physically, and that they should never do it in fear of the consequences that they might have to face later on.   Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else, they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge. We live in a world today where education is everything, and we believe that everyone should have an education. But if we take away every book that a person does not like, then what do we have left to learn from? We must preserve the diversity of knowledge in libraries for the betterment of all.
558	3535	2	3	Censorship in libraries is an important thing in schools and in the public. It is important because some of the movies, books, and magazines have a bigger influence on the kids than most people think. Like some of the really gory movies where there are always people in the movie getting cut up or shot. Do you really think that some kids don't think about that stuff? Sometimes the kids can get it in their heads that they can do what they see or read.   Like in the movie @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, they are beating up and killing people just because they are of a certain color. And some kids might think that that is okay. And they can go down to their library and just get it off the shelf and check it out and go home and watch it. Now, if you're using it as a thing to teach kids that it was the way things used to be and that it is wrong, then that is okay. You can teach your kids all you want, just make sure that it is the right thing.   And some magazines that are in the schools or in the public library are just not the kind of thing that kids should be looking at. Like the gun magazines or the hunting magazines that just show that it is okay to carry a gun wherever they go. And the hunting magazines just show that you can go out and shoot stuff. And some kids might be confused that you need a license to do all of that. You have to at least put an age limit on some stuff.   It's the same way with some of the books. They always start out good and then they just turn into a big mess of gore and violence. Like the book 'Sphere', it started out with a group of people going underwater to explore a ship. And they find a big sphere and they go in it and get these powers and they imagine it and it comes true. Well, when a kid reads that, they might think that they can do that and they start imagining that they can either hurt or really do some damage to someone. And then when they find out that it won't work, they might do it to themselves.   So it just comes to show that you should censor some of the stuff that you have in your libraries. And if you can't take them out, then at least put an age limit on them. This way, we can protect the young and impressionable minds from potentially harmful content while still allowing access for those who are more mature and can handle it.
559	3536	2	3	Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries? No, I think that if a person is offended by it, then they should not get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them. If the person complains about a book, music, movies, or anything, then they should not go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be allowed in the library.   When I was in seventh grade, we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awesome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh - graders had to research an animal. When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians. He was a man of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended by it because his grandfather was a slave. I read the book and I thought there was nothing offensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free.   My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People that do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks that a book is offensive, then they should just walk away and find a different book. That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the right of individuals to access knowledge, even if it might be uncomfortable for some.
560	3537	2	3	Censorship in Libraries  Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' There are many books, magazines, and movies out there that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children might be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf.   All people of all ages have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different, and this causes the interests of each person to be different as well. Libraries offer a wide variety of materials, and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries might seem like a good idea for children; however, adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.   Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. There is content out there that children should not see; however, adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults might find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials, and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. There are many different types of books and music out there, and censoring these would greatly limit the variety.   In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what their child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting, and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent might not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. After all, you cannot shelter children from everything.   Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the @LOCATION1, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as individuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We must strike a balance between protecting the young and preserving the rights and freedoms of all library patrons.
561	3538	2	3	Censorship Censorship: is it needed in today's society? Where things that were considered bad 10 even 20 years ago are okay today to be viewed, read, listened to, and so on. Is it a needed process or should libraries have the free will to stock their shelves with whatever they seem fit to be there? Is it still a good process to use or is it an outdated, unneeded resource that is now no longer needed? Everybody in today's society says to read, but libraries may not have the type of literature that you are into. So, why would you want to read something that you do not like because the library does not have the book that you wanted to see? I believe that censorship in libraries should be there to remove any book they find offensive or immoral from their library. I do not believe they should remove books because of bad language, or something about God. I think that books, magazines, or movies with 'inappropriate' content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit. Libraries should only feature books that they want to have, not ones that are popular but considered 'bad' by the library. They should only have books they want to have. I do believe that there should be censorship in libraries. I just do not believe that it should be a harsh system. I think that they should set standards on what they want to have and follow those standards on books they buy. I do think however that some libraries will set their standards too low or high, so that they will either have many books that are considered 'bad', or no books at all. It is a very fine line when it comes to materials that the library has to consider good or bad. I think libraries should have a set of standards nationwide to set what type of material is good for libraries. I believe that censorship is still a needed, and helpful process. I just think that it is too much of an opinionated process, not enough facts or opinions of the people. I think that it should remain in use for society; I just believe it should be more under control than it is today. In conclusion, finding the right balance in library censorship is crucial to ensure that both the protection of certain values and the freedom of access to diverse materials are maintained.
562	3539	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue, censorship should not be allowed in libraries. The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a Catholic school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population. Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it too. The audience they are trying to appeal to may not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person may enjoy thoroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others. In a great deal of different types of literature, censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize - winning novel, Fahrenheit 451, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human - kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain. As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people may never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation, I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privilege to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves. In conclusion, maintaining the integrity of library collections without excessive censorship is essential for the cultural and intellectual growth of society.
563	3540	2	3	Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system. In the US, people have the right to express their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away that right by not allowing certain books to be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person who wrote the book or the writer of the script for a movie. If the librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library, then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like, then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class. In school, we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something, we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect; we learned that in kindergarten. I think that they should show us respect too and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us. Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimination against the writer. We get in trouble if we verbally discriminate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimination? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writer. In conclusion, the proper enforcement of anti - censorship laws is necessary to uphold the rights of both readers and creators.
564	3541	2	3	Do you think that books that have vulgar things in them should be on libraries' shelves? We all know that there are books out there that parents hope we never get a hold of. In this time, try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it. It is nearly impossible to do that. Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gore, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled off the shelf. Have you seen the banned book list lately? I have, and some of those books on there are ridiculous. Here are a few: To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and The Chocolate War. I could go on and on; the list is a mile long. Some of these books have historical meanings behind them. There is also morals behind them. I think that books should not be pulled from the shelf because they have a few bad words in them. It's not like we have never heard those words. In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, they have banned it from schools because of the use of the word 'nigger'. This is not a nice word in our day and time. Back when we had slaves, that is what they were called. It is points and views from an anti - slavery author. In Charlotte's Web, it is banned because of animals talking. Come on, really? They have animals in movies that talk all the time. I believe that if kids don't know that animals can't really talk, we might have problems. Do you find the show South Park the offensive? Well, it has been banned because it is racist against African - Americans. I would like to know how some of these people come up with this. Whoever picks up this offensive material has a choice whether or not they read it. It should be on the shelf even if it is offensive. I believe that it is totally up to you if you read it. Just like if you go to a movie store, they have the movies rated. You don't want to watch rated R movies then don't rent it. They could use the same method with books. Do you still think offensive books should be pulled from shelves? If you say yes, I would like to know why. It is your choice to read it. There are already all these other banned books out there; why ban any more? Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gore, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled from shelves. In conclusion, the decision to ban books should not be made lightly, and readers should have the freedom to choose what they want to engage with.
565	3542	2	3	I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to enlighten, inform, and entertain the readers. If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine, it doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read. Don't make the people who don't have a problem with what they're reading or watching suffer. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do! There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the library won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet I was raised reading those books, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies; I was allowed to watch rated R movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's for a child or adult, like PG to rated R. The library has the same rules; a child cannot rent a movie rated R without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater. Parents who are worried about their children's well - being shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one. Like some libraries ban 'The Diary of Anne Frank', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, who didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book, they would have understood it wasn't meant to be offensive, but a fictional story of a young girl's experiences during the Holocaust. I remember living in a town, with a lot of Christian people, so the libraries only had Christian books. When I went to the librarian and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down because of the Christian population. I told them 'I have as much right to have those books on the shelf, as they
566	3543	2	3	In Katherine Paterson's writing, she clearly conveys that she doesn't want her child to casually pick up a book off the shelf that could potentially be offensive. However, I firmly believe that libraries should have sections that are hidden from the public eye yet still accessible to specific individuals. For instance, if my child were to pick up a book that isn't suitable for their age group, I wouldn't get angry. I understand that some book categorizations are close to one another, and all books are on display, which might be offensive to some. In such a situation, I'd gently tell my son or daughter that the book isn't for them, and then we'd go together to pick out a new, appropriate book to read. Overall, I am of the opinion that libraries should have distinct sections dedicated to specific age groups, keeping them out of sight from kids. I remember once, when I was a little kid, wandering through the seemingly endless shelves in search of a truly wonderful book. Unfortunately, I ended up stumbling upon a book that wasn't meant for my age. So, I strongly think that library staff need to be more vigilant to ensure that such incidents never happen again.
567	3544	2	3	There are indeed some movies, books, music, and other forms of media that can be found offensive to certain people. I firmly feel that if you're of the appropriate age for a particular type of literature, you should have the right to access and observe it. If you read a book and find it offensive, then perhaps you shouldn't have chosen to read it in the first place. Books, music, and movies are primarily created to entertain. However, if you're not entertained by what you're reading or watching, it simply means that it's not the right fit for you. I once had an experience where I was deeply offended by a movie I watched. The movie degraded women by showing them being beaten and treated as slaves. As I watched it, I couldn't help but think that these women were someone's daughter and mother. I would never agree to my own mother being treated that way, and I certainly wouldn't want any other woman to endure such treatment either. After watching the movie, I immediately went and told my mother about how it had offended me. I'm sure that most authors don't write books with the intention of offending readers. Nevertheless, there should be a way for them to rephrase and restate certain things they say. I'm well - aware that people have different opinions and think differently. If it's obvious that a book is written with the intention of offending the reader, then one shouldn't purchase it. If you come across a book on the shelf and find it offensive, there's no need to remove it from the shelf. Another person might read it and actually like it. Everyone has their own way of thinking and absorbing information. What might be offensive to one reader could be well - received and admired by someone else. In conclusion, I firmly believe that if you're offended by a certain book, type of music, or movie, you should learn from the experience and explain why it offended you. If a parent is offended, they should also prevent their children from accessing it, as it could have a negative impact on the child. After all, books, music, movies, and other forms of media are meant to entertain, not to offend.
568	3545	2	3	I believe that censorship is a highly debatable subject for many. But I think I have a well - considered outlook and a clear view on this matter. In this essay, I'm going to present my reasoning and explain why I think censorship is a good thing and why it perhaps should be enforced more strictly. Censorship involves the question of whether books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. I believe in a free society where everyone has the right to read what they want and what they don't. If an adult wants to read something vulgar, it's their choice. However, when it comes to children, I think they should not have unrestricted access to such content. To keep children away from vulgar things, libraries and other media outlets should have separate sections for kids and adults. By doing so, children may not even be aware of the inappropriate content or develop a desire for it. If parents think it's okay for their children to read, watch, or listen to certain things, they should obtain it for them until the children reach adulthood. I don't advocate for children to be shielded from the real world, but I do believe there should be a reasonable limit to what they are exposed to. Clearly, I think censorship is a good thing. I believe that if there were more censorship, there would be less crime. Kids are exposed to various things from a very young age, and they may start thinking that certain behaviors are acceptable. While I'm not saying that all kids learn everything from TV, books, and music, I do think these forms of media have a significant impact on how children view the world. As much as I love rap music and movies like A.T.L and rappers like @ORGANIZATION1, sometimes when I listen to or watch them, I feel a bit jaded and develop a negative attitude. It makes me realize how powerful the influence of media can be. The media, including music, TV, books, and magazines, can affect our mood, actions, and even the way we talk and dress. I'm not saying that having an urban style is bad, but when it leads to criminal behavior and drug use, it becomes a problem. I believe that only children should be subject to censorship, not adults. Once a person reaches adulthood, they have a better understanding of what they should and shouldn't do. Children, on the other hand, are still developing and are like sponges, absorbing information from the world around them. Censorship is a sensitive and debatable issue, but this is my view. What's yours?
569	3546	2	3	To whom it may concern; As a student, I find myself reading quite frequently. Whether at home, at school, in the library, or even in the car, I'm always on the lookout for a good novel. However, not all the novels I read are ones I've chosen for my personal growth. I must admit that I'm not an enthusiastic reader on my own. I'm the kind of student who only enjoys reading books that truly interest me. Many of the books I choose are closely related to real - life situations, which often include content that could be considered explicit. I firmly believe that books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be removed from the shelves. As @CAPS1 citizens, we are granted the right to free speech. This fundamental right allows us to express our thoughts and opinions freely without any restrictions on our personalities. It also gives authors and producers the freedom to base their work on their own ideas. Media that might be considered explicit appeals to a wide range of people, while others find it disturbing. With the freedom we have as @CAPS2, we have the power to choose whether to watch certain movies or read specific books, and we also have the option to avoid them. When producers create movies with sexual content, strong language, or violence, they know that not every citizen will want to watch them. There's no law forcing us to watch movies we don't like. We have the ability to make our own choices. Explicit material is everywhere. When walking in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most of which contain explicit content. But it's important to note that although many novels have explicit material, there are still plenty that don't. People often complain about explicit content in novels, but in reality, there are numerous novels without such content. As humans, we tend to focus on the negative aspects of situations and lead pessimistic lives. We need to learn to look for the good in things. There's a vast amount of media that contains no explicit or sexual material, and we're given clear warnings about what does and doesn't have such content. These warnings are mandatory! Labels like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 indicate whether a piece of media is suitable for general audiences, with or without parental supervision. Parents have the responsibility to monitor what their children are exposed to. They can set rules for their children, such as only allowing them to watch @CAPS3 - rated movies or requiring parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to take an active role in monitoring and caring for their children. If they don't like the music, novels, or movies their children are interested in, they have the right and the power to change it. Instead of trying to remove all explicit material from the market, parents should set their own limits for their families and have open discussions with their children about it. Katherine Paterson is absolutely right when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the power to remove any books, movies, magazines, etc. that we don't think should be on the market, we'd likely end up with no media at all. With billions of citizens in @LOCATION1 alone, each person is likely to find something wrong with a particular book. If we removed every book with a perceived flaw, we'd have no variety of material to choose from. People who are strongly in favor of eliminating explicit material would act quickly, while those against it might not be as vocal. This could lead to a chaotic and divided society. We, as humans, value our freedoms and the ability to make choices. Taking away our freedom to choose what we read or watch would undermine our individuality and self - expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be enjoyed based on personal opinion, and this should remain the case.
570	3547	2	3	To whom it may concern, I firmly believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves of a library if they are found offensive. What might seem offensive to some people can be viewed very differently by others. I think that if there are books or other media that are considered offensive, libraries should create a special section for them, where mature individuals can access them. Books are extremely valuable to many people in the United States. A lot of people enjoy reading things that others might find offensive. Just because one person reads a book or magazine and finds something they don't like, it doesn't mean the entire work should be labeled offensive. I'm sure many others would share the same view. Along with books, I also believe that movies and other forms of media should not be removed from library shelves. Libraries typically have kids' sections, adult sections, and even teenage sections. Nowadays, some parents don't want their children to learn about certain things at a young age. But I still think that if parents don't want their kids reading or accessing certain materials, they should take the responsibility to prevent them from doing so. If there's ever a topic that deserves a second look and a fair chance, this is it. Libraries around the world are well - organized. So, why can't they create a section specifically for books, movies, and magazines that some people find offensive? Sure, it might require a bit more effort, but someone has to do it. As you can see, there are very good reasons why libraries shouldn't remove materials that some people find offensive. After all, a lot of the so - called offensive materials are based on true stories or are biographies. People really do enjoy many of these books, movies, and magazines. It would be truly great if libraries could implement this change. It would make a lot of people happy and satisfied, allowing them to access the materials they want while respecting the concerns of others.
571	3548	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I firmly believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the diverse tastes of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own unique opinions on what is considered offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like, it will make a lot of people happier. The wants and needs of people vary greatly from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another might hate. This should not influence whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want. Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be exposed to the media world where not everything has positive influences. That's life though and not everyone has the same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well. Opinions will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's access to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place where all materials can coexist, allowing individuals to make their own choices.
572	3549	2	3	Libraries hold a vast array of books and movies, including fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure. These books have many different styles and portrayals, and many of these might be taken as offensive, but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf. One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go, and it calls them offensive names. Yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why? Because it was written back when slavery was legal and slaves were treated as property, not people. A movie that many people have seen recently is Slumdog Millionaire. This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the game show 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'. Many Indians, who believe they are smarter, could be offended by this because it implies that if you grow up in a slum, you can't be smart. But people often brush it off because it is a movie, so it isn't real. But if you go to some people and ask them about these books or movies, some will say they are really good, while others might be offended. So they might as well stay on the shelves. The book 'The Killer Angels' is a book about the Civil War. Could this be seen as offensive, showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time? Yet it is another classic and will stay on the bookshelves. So books in libraries shouldn't be censored because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group. They should stay on the shelf because every book, other than some children's books, has something offensive. Thus, if we took books off the shelves for being offensive, there would be nothing to read except for 'The Cat in the Hat'! In conclusion, libraries should preserve these works to offer a diverse and unfiltered view of history and society.
573	3550	2	3	Would you ever read a book about the Holocaust times if you're Jewish? Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured? Probably not. If you're a colored man/woman, are you going to engage in a book that talks about slavery? Not likely. How about if you are a mother, are you going to want to read a novel or magazine about abortion? Are you going to let your child read that book? Of course not! So you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves, right? It's on the shelves for basically one reason, to immerse us in the knowledge it holds. Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there is always going to be one person who is against it all. When we read, we find books that are to our own enjoyment; we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads. Most of us, however, don't quite understand why others refuse to read such a book or even hold in their hands a book that is different from all their beliefs. Beliefs are important to people no matter their age, gender, sexuality, or their race. It's just a way of life. Some stories are there for our entertainment, some catch our emotions, and some are there for our knowledge. When authors write, they usually think of events that have happened or what they predict could happen in the future. Authors try to get you to understand the world around you, not by trying to offend you in any way. Books tend to affect people in many ways, positive and yes, sometimes negative. It's something they can't really control though, so you can't really blame anyone for you being offended. I don't agree that libraries shouldn't have these books on their shelves. I think they are good for us. No, I don't mean we should go around eating books. We should take time to read some of those so - called offensive books. You are probably thinking, there is no way I'm going to pick up that type of book and sit down and read it. However, let me tell you that if we read these books, the more people will understand about how terrible times were back then and how some things are still bad. Take abortion into perspective. Books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is and how it can not only affect the woman who goes through with it. It appeals to the emotions of others in a way that makes them think twice about life's decisions. In conclusion, these so - called offensive books are valuable resources that can broaden our understanding and empathy.
574	3551	2	3	In my opinion, I do not believe that anyone has the right to decide what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people, it oversteps its bounds. There are laws against restricting what a person can or cannot view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be, but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society cannot censor everything are because not everyone is offended by everything. When someone gets offended by the media that is out there, that does not necessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censored because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be considered unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic. Books that are considered inappropriate should be decided for censorship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. When children are growing up and are taught the values they know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf', and all that means is that if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like, then there would not be any books left. I believe in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well. Individuality is when one person has different traits or feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the music we listen to, and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to think that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them different because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases. Also from experience I have learned that a book that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same to happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understanding, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and choices, and let parents take the lead in guiding their children's media consumption.
575	3552	2	3	Take it seriously? How do you take it when people come out with magazines, movies, or music that is extremely offensive to you? How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things? The truth is we can not stop them. There is so much pornography and bad music out in this world that you can get it anywhere. It is all over the internet, and you can't control that. If I find something very offensive in a store or online, I should have the right to voice my opinion, and that opinion should be taken seriously. They shouldn't have inappropriate things in public stores or places children can go. That is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids. Some people should just know better and take it seriously. Almost every day that I go online, I see something on the side of the website advertising some kind of pornography site. It's unbelievable how that is allowed on public websites for everyone to see. If they're going to continue to do this, there needs to be some law saying they cannot be on public sites. I see things of half - naked ladies on the side of the website, and I know that's not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages. I understand a lot of things in this world is about money, and people make money by selling things to others. Selling movies, magazines, and music that say or do things that are rebellious is easy money for older teens and adults. They can still make good money if they were to make funny stuff instead of pornographic things. Everyone loves to watch, read, or listen to something funny. So basically, we aren't going to stop this completely, and you all should know that. The best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day. It should die down eventually. We can only hope for the best. In conclusion, while complete eradication may be impossible, we must take steps to minimize the exposure of offensive content, especially to the younger generation.
576	3553	2	3	Libraries have always housed a diverse range of interesting materials, including various books, different types of music, a wide selection of movies, and numerous magazines, and this will remain the case. Libraries are indeed one of the finest places to discover those materials. I firmly believe that libraries should not be compelled to remove those materials from their shelves because perhaps some people find them highly interesting. After all, libraries thrive on having people interested in reading their books. If some individuals find different books offensive, they simply shouldn't go near those books. If they have a complaint, they should keep it to themselves and not deprive others of the chance to check them out. Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material off their shelves just because some people don't like them. It's an individual's choice to read a particular book, and nobody is forcing anyone to read something that makes them uncomfortable. Now, if there were a large number of people who take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could decide whether to take action or not, but they still don't need to be dictated to. It's their business, and they have the right to decide which materials stay and which ones go. If I were one of those who took offense to a book in the library, I would simply keep it to myself. I wouldn't want to go through the hassle of arguing and complaining just because of one book. We should think of others before ourselves sometimes and consider their interests. This way, we'll have less trouble in life.
577	3554	2	3	They should not be removed from the shelves. If someone finds a particular item offensive, they don't have to look at it or check it out. If someone finds it offensive, they can ask for that material to be placed on the highest shelf there. They have the option of whether they can access it or not. Many materials found in a library, even if they are considered offensive, can be beneficial for someone else. The material could contain or present some much - needed information. The people who find it offensive have the right to avoid looking at it. Just because there is some material they find offensive doesn't mean that everyone else does too. People don't need to look at something that they find offensive. If there is something offensive about an item, they can simply ask a librarian if they can place that book or movie up higher on the shelves. If they find something offensive about the material, they can just refrain from looking at it. Just don't check it out if you find it offensive. If they need it out of sight, you can always put it on the highest shelf. There is a significant amount of offensive material in libraries. Even though they are found offensive to some, someone else could use that material for a paper or project. Getting rid of a material can deprive someone of information about whatever they are researching. Books are often the easiest way to get information, but not when you are getting rid of them. The reason why material from libraries should not be taken away is that kids can still find that stuff on the internet. If you get rid of those materials, you might as well get rid of your internet too. No matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff, there is always a way for them to see it. So, the offensive material should not be taken off the shelves in the library because they are needed, and children will find out about the offensive stuff whenever they want to. In conclusion, maintaining a balance in the library's collection is crucial to ensure that everyone can access the information they need.
578	3555	2	3	If you saw a book on the shelf of your library that offended you in some way, how would you react? Would you simply pass the book by and continue searching for another, or would you be so bothered by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately? Every school, public library, movie theatre, magazine stand, and any form of media in this world will say or do something that someone is not going to like. It could be in a magazine's do - and - don'ts section, and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list, or it could be something about a specific race. Everyone, at some point in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other people's words and publications in the world, but I don't think that will ever stop. All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposes. These things in the world are not for one specific group of people; they are for everyone. Every individual person has their own opinion, and not everyone else is going to agree with that person. Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is trendy right now doesn't mean that they should remove it from their magazines for all of their viewers. To me, that is just ridiculous. So, say you stumbled across a book about @ORGANIZATION1 in the library, and you are a person of negro descent. Would you get offended? Or, say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago, would that anger you? If I were a person of negro descent, it wouldn't make me mad at all because it is just history, history that happened a long time ago and does not pertain to me. We couldn't toss those books out anyway because without those history books at school, we couldn't learn about our history. History is important to everyone, and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out, how would we prevent history from repeating itself? When I was a young child, my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to do with abuse. I tried to have my mother watch a movie with me called '@CAPS1'. The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies, and she finally gets out of it and improves her and her children's lives. My mom said that she couldn't watch it with me because 'it hit too close to home.' Everyone is going to be offended by the media at some point in their life. The media does not consider you as an individual, just as part of a population. When one person doesn't like something, it doesn't mean it should be removed or erased from history; it should just be rewritten or refilmed. You can't control what everyone else says or does in books or movies; you have to be in control of how you view it. That is what I choose to do, and I believe it's working out well. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of media content and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.
579	3556	2	3	No, because people have different likes when it comes to books, movies, music, and magazines. If people remove certain items from libraries, then patrons won't come back to those libraries. They will go somewhere else to get the movie or whatever they are looking for. Some people want certain materials to be removed, but some don't want them to be taken away. If you don't want your kids to read, listen to, or watch certain materials, don't let them access them. In a library, there is a wide range of content to cater to different interests. Removing items based on the preferences of a few could limit the choices available to others. It's important to respect the fact that different people have different tastes, and libraries should strive to provide a diverse collection. By allowing a variety of materials, libraries can serve a broader audience and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to find something they enjoy. So, instead of removing items, we should focus on providing clear guidance and age - appropriate categorization to help people make their own choices.
580	3557	2	3	What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not excessive censorship. Each person has their own unique interests and should be able to find something in their library that suits their taste. Certain materials are too intense to be placed in libraries. There are specialized stores that can provide you with that kind of material for purchase. Most parents wouldn't want their children to be exposed to these particular materials, so they believe that libraries shouldn't offer these types of items. Now, there are some materials that are on the borderline in terms of their content. They are strong, but not so strong that they can't be placed in libraries. Some people enjoy these more intense materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their enjoyment. Just because someone doesn't like the material that the library has provided doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that were the case, there would be nothing left in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, whether it's more mature materials or something a little more 'tame'. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't determine what is and isn't in the library. I myself enjoy a wide variety of materials from libraries. Sometimes I prefer strong materials, and other times I go for more 'tame' ones. It all depends on the person's own interests and choices. Sometimes in @MONTH1, I can be disappointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there because, to some people, it's too strong, but to me and others, it's just a good source of harmless entertainment. In conclusion, I think that there should be a reasonable amount of censorship in libraries, but not so much that people can't find things that interest them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, and libraries should not be shaped by an individual's opinions. Instead, they should aim to provide a balanced collection that caters to the diverse interests of the community.
581	3558	2	3	"Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive should be removed from the shelves in our libraries? Well, this is what I'm going to talk about in my essay. I firmly believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves. The reason is that just because you don't like a particular aspect in one book, it doesn't mean that another person won't find it interesting or valuable. Also, some books that have offensive content can help you realize the consequences that could occur or reinform you about those kinds of issues. If you think the reading material is something you wouldn't read or you consider it inappropriate, then simply don't read it. This way, it remains available for someone else who actually wants to read such content. Sometimes, I'll go to the library to find a book that I saw in a different store, but they don't have it. When I ask about it, they say that if they don't have it, there must be something in it that could be offensive to others. But I know that a lot of people like those so - called ""nasty gross"" books, while some don't. People have different opinions about things. So, just because the person who has the authority to take the books off the shelf or put them on doesn't like the book or thinks it's not appropriate, it doesn't mean that someone else won't like it either. Well, this is what I think of certain books or anything else that contains offensive reading material being taken off the shelves. I sincerely hope it makes people realize that others have different preferences, so leave the offensive readings available so that people can learn that if they don't like it, they can choose not to read it."
582	3559	2	3	Well today I am going to talk to you about censorship in books, music, movies, and magazines in your libraries because some of them can be quite graphic about the things they talk about or the actions in a story. While it's true that some are more graphic than others, that doesn't mean you have to take them off the shelf. Not everyone is into sexual books, but there are definitely people out there who enjoy reading about such topics. Some people like to read about murders and gangs selling drugs, and that's okay. Everyone has their own taste in what they like. It could be a novel, a particular organization's - related content, sports, a well - known brand's - related stuff, just a true story that has happened to someone, and so on. That's just the nature of the world. How boring would it be if everyone liked the same things? Definitely very boring. So, therefore, I don't think books should be taken off the shelves. It could be the next great story for somebody. You never know. Now with music, yes, the so - called rap today often contains content that your kids probably shouldn't listen to. It mostly talks about sex, drugs, alcohol, and so on. But that doesn't give you the right to take those albums off the shelf because that's what some people like to listen to. However, there is also a lot of other music out there. There are the oldies, country, jazz, hip - hop, and more. For the most part, all music is good; it's just that some are better in certain aspects than others. Take country music for instance. Yes, it might talk about some sex and alcohol, but that's not the whole song. It mainly talks about country boys and the things they do or the experiences they've had over time, and it's often quite relatable. So all music has its merits, and without music, I don't think the world would be a very pleasant place. People listen to music all the time, whether they're working out, at work, driving, or just sitting at home. So there is good music and not - so - good music, and you get to decide. But with movies, there are some movies made specifically for adult entertainment. Yes, it might seem a bit pointless, but they exist and probably won't go away. There are movies about sex, drugs, and alcohol. That's just part of life; everything is not perfect. In this regard, you have to tell your children about these things and prevent them from watching such movies at a young age. I think it plays a significant role in teen pregnancy because if they see it and think it looks fun, they might want to try it. And sexual content is so easily accessible, all over the web and elsewhere. It's like drugs; they're so easy to get. There are meth labs everywhere for meth, and there is weed all around. You just have to tell your kids what they can watch and what they can't. Disney, a well - known children's organization, and some popular kids' channels are all great shows for kids. So parents, take charge of that stuff. Now we come to magazines. There are millions of magazines all around the world. They are one thing that will never disappear from this world. They carry news, entertainment, comics, or tips on how to do something. They'll be around until the end of the world. But yes, handle them with caution. There are some magazines that your children should never look at until they're adults. But that doesn't make the people who enjoy looking at such magazines bad. It's just what some people like. It's not like you can stop your son from looking at a certain type of magazine or your daughter from looking at porn. It's all part of life. But you can prevent it from happening at a young age. You just have to make it clear to your child not to look at this stuff until they're older. But you can't stop everything. All I'm trying to say is that yes, there are some bad things out there, but there are also a lot of good things. That doesn't give you the right to remove them.
583	3560	2	3	Do I think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries? No, books should not be removed from libraries. If students are in high school, they pretty much already have an understanding of what's going on in the world. Teens talk about their lives openly, so high - school and middle - school students are likely to hear about various things. If parents are sending their child to school and don't want them to hear about certain topics, well, it's not really possible to shield them completely. In school, students will hear verbal arguments and see fights. If parents don't want their children to hear about such things from other kids, they should explain it to them themselves. One way or another, teens will find out about these things. It could come from their parents, friends, teachers, or anyone. Teens don't really care if your child is watching when they're fighting; they're not concerned about that at that moment. The saying 'one person ruins it all for everybody' holds true because some teens need to grow up and act their age. If you can't act your age, then you probably shouldn't be in the grade you're in. Kids and teens need to mature. If they can't read a book without being immature about it, then they should choose not to read it. If their parents let them watch movies that they think they're old enough to watch, they shouldn't take advantage of that privilege. Taking books out of the libraries will not change anything. Kids will still fight and roughhouse. Yes, some books are a bit outrageous, but not all of them. To be honest, libraries should have sections of books based on the age or grade of the readers. High - schoolers should be able to handle reading about sex, drugs, or drinking. If they're not responsible enough to read such content, then they shouldn't be getting those books anyway. Songs made today can sometimes get a bit out of control. If your child listens to music with all the bad words, talking about sex, drugs, and alcohol, then parents just need to take away those songs. Teens who are mature shouldn't be punished just because some immature kids can't watch a movie, listen to a song, read a book, or look at a magazine responsibly. It's not fair to those who can handle these situations. People who act their age should be able to read, watch the movie, or engage with other materials because they can deal with the content appropriately. So, don't punish everyone just because of some immature kids who ruin it for everybody. In conclusion, removing offensive books from libraries is not a solution, and we should focus on teaching responsibility instead.
584	3561	2	3	I'm writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries. I firmly do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I hold this view is that everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or deems it offensive doesn't mean that everyone will share that sentiment. What one person dislikes, another person might love. The only situation in which I think a certain material should be removed from the shelf is when there are numerous complaints about the same material. Then, maybe the library should consider removing the item. That's why libraries have ratings and different sections so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch. It makes no sense to pick up a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive when there are so many other things to choose from. Imagine how someone would feel if one of their favorite books or movies was being removed from the library shelves just because another person didn't like it. They would be extremely upset and disappointed. In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea of removing certain materials from the shelves if they are considered offensive. I sincerely hope that you will understand my point of view and take my thoughts into consideration when making decisions about library censorship.
585	3562	2	3	'Hey', I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First, I'm well - aware that people have different views on things like magazines, books, and music. There are indeed things that might be offensive to you, but not offensive to other people. Take music for example. There is a wide variety of music out there. I know that some people find rap music offensive, while others don't. A lot of those who don't find it offensive can relate to it on some level. Second, I feel that if the people who find certain materials offensive would just ignore them, then there wouldn't be a problem. I'm sure that there is probably a type of magazine, book, or even a genre of music that they enjoy which might be offensive to someone else. So, for them to judge these things based on their own sensibilities wouldn't be fair. Third, I'm pretty confident that if something in the library was extremely offensive, the library wouldn't have it in the first place. Maybe if we spent more time focusing on our own lives instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not, the world might be a better place. I understand that people have different views, but we shouldn't let these differences get to us. As you can see, I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. There are billions of people on this earth, and it's highly unlikely that they would all have the same opinion. So many people have different opinions and beliefs about things. In the end, we should respect these differences and not try to censor materials just because a few people find them offensive.
586	3563	2	3	According to Katherine Paterson, who wrote an article about censorship in the library, the question arises: Should we be able to have the right to take a book, magazine, movie, etc. off the shelf freely, whether we're offended by it or not? I firmly believe we should not have that right to pull things off of shelves freely. If we had that right, it would cause problems from many standpoints if you think about it.  One problem it could cause is regarding people's thoughts towards a book, movie, CD, and so forth. If one person looks at a particular item and says, 'I don't like this and that about it,' and then just pulls it off the shelf, then that's one less thing for somebody who does like it. Just because that person doesn't like what the material offers to the public, it doesn't mean somebody else doesn't. Nobody in this entire world is exactly the same. Every person in this world has their likes and dislikes. If they had the freedom to take things, then there would be nothing for anybody to read, listen to, watch, or even eat in some cases.  You also have to think about how this would affect the business of stores, libraries, and other businesses. If everybody is pulling everything off shelves, what would there be to sell or read? If a business is not making any money, then they're going to have to be closed down. Especially in today's economy, no business wants to run low on money.  In Katherine's article at the end, she said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That is basically reiterating what I said earlier about people's likes and dislikes about everything. If you don't want your kids or anybody else's kids looking at something you believe is offensive, you should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section, like a section for older kids and people.  Mainly, it falls on parents to decide what content they want their kids looking at. You're the ones to raise them the way you want to raise them. If you think they are too young for something, then that's when you tell them no or take appropriate action. We should not have the right to take anything off of a shelf. Books, movies, music, and etc. are for entertainment. If it doesn't entertain you, it does not mean it doesn't for anybody else. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of preferences and not let individual dislikes lead to the removal of valuable cultural and entertainment resources.
587	3564	2	3	There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compassion. However, other books can have mean or hateful effects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, which involves taking books, movies, magazines, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.  In many cases, censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a tender age. In libraries, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying. For instance, books with excessive violence or inappropriate language should be kept away from young children.  Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young person's head. This can cause an effect on that child and they may start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing. For example, music with lyrics promoting violence or drug use should be restricted for young audiences.  Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barely had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of disturbing content when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many nightmares from the movies or books that she read.  Now that I am older, my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personally been offended by some books. Although, censored books may have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.  Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the innocent minds of young children. In conclusion, censorship plays a crucial role in safeguarding the well - being and proper development of young people, and it should be carried out effectively in various media forms.
588	3565	2	3	People have different types of genres of books, music, movies, etc., that they like as well as those they don't like. Meaning that it's up to you what you like and you are not forced to read or listen to anything you don't want to. Books, music, and other entertaining things are here as an option, so if you don't like it then you don't have to deal with it.  I feel that it is not necessary that books should be removed from the shelves just because someone has gotten offended by it. You were not told that it is a must to read that book and it wasn't the company nor the author's fault that you rented the book and you felt insulted. Most likely, there were not directing the story towards you, so why get all worked up over something that has happened to you and take it out on the media? You chose it of your own free will. Why make the company lose investment over something that could be easily taken care of by simply taking it back where you got it from?  I have read various books, listened to different songs, and seen lots of movies that weren't in my best interest, but I didn't make them stop selling them because I'm pretty sure someone out there likes it. Why stop someone else's enjoyment because of my uninterest? It's really not that necessary. And that's the problem in the world today, people take little situations into a big catastrophe for no reason. If you don't like it then don't get it. People need to put their feet in the company's shoes and realize that if it was them, they would understand.  Books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are made for everyone in the world to make entertainment for those who are interested. Taking them off the shelves would be more than unnecessary just because some person doesn't like it. People have different opinions about life and that's what makes every individual different from one another. So why ruin other people's fun just to get what you want?  As I stated before, it is not necessary to remove an item from the shelves because someone has taken offense to something. It's not the company's fault, so just simply don't buy it or take it back. Things would be so much better. Get the items that best fit you and leave the others that don't on the shelves. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of cultural and entertainment products and not let personal sensitivities disrupt the availability of these resources for others.
589	3566	2	3	Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the library? Well, in my point of view, I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are amazing, exciting, and fun to read or watch, and they should not be removed from the shelves in the local library. For a fact, people in general have many types of tastes in books. There's drama, romance, action, and many other genres that also apply to movies, magazines, and etc. The public should not be punished for one's interest in themes and how they take the book. There should be an age limit within which kids can't read certain books, and those of age should read whatever they please.  I, myself, like to read scary books. They give me chills and all types of questions run through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book. Without books that don't fit our personality, there would be less people in libraries reading and more people trying to keep themselves occupied. And half of them might even get bored and start committing crimes to keep themselves occupied. People in the community have rights to read, hear, or watch whichever type of material they like.  If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy. Just because the book is about 'violence' or they simply don't like the theme, they should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them, and it's from the authors' or directors' choice to share with us their stories. Without books like those, many people can't get ideas to help them create their own book or novel.  So that is my view on the situation. People should enjoy whatever material they like. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazines should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local library and see how it will change your mind. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of choice in reading and viewing materials and not let individual discomfort lead to the removal of valuable creative works.
590	3567	2	3	There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made - up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive. But should those materials be removed from the library? Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be.  In my opinion, I don't think that things should be removed from a library. Certain people may find things offensive, and others may think it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in a library.  I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult. That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about. I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way, kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults. For example, books with explicit sexual content or extreme violence should be restricted to the adult section.  I also think that there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery, they should have an area for books that are about that, so that people who are offended by it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. I don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people may enjoy reading them.  Some reading material may be found offensive to certain people, but to others, it may not be. I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries. There are some things that people may need to have in a library if they are doing a project, so that way they have the resources to do it.  I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are allowed in the store. Kids don't need to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school. That just isn't right. Especially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.  So in my opinion, there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing should be restricted. Magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them. In conclusion, a balanced approach of age - appropriate access and clear labeling can ensure that libraries remain a resource for all while protecting the well - being of young patrons.
591	3568	2	3	I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people who find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I firmly believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are clearly being paranoid. For instance, if a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then simply don't allow them to get it. There's no need to make all the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a real problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.' First of all, people hold a wide variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is acceptable, while others don't. If one person decides to remove a book from the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They may find violence perfectly acceptable and might even allow their kids to read the book. This would then create a big conflict. Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need to help their kids know the difference between right and wrong. If children don't read books or watch movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover such content when they're older? As a child, it is a crucial time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults. Censorship is similar to what Hitler did to prevent people from thinking for themselves and discovering that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in a free society. The citizens of the United States have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great. By respecting individual choices and avoiding unnecessary censorship, we can foster a more open and inclusive society where everyone can freely explore different ideas and perspectives.
592	3569	2	3	Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are constantly exposed to many adult - related things, whether it's through watching TV or a movie, or just witnessing certain situations at home. I firmly believe that censorship is necessary for young children. They shouldn't be exposed to bad language, graphic scenes, or content that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers, on the other hand, present a whole different scenario. They are often eager to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. For boys, it's all about action, while for girls, it's about drama, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these elements. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that they're old enough to see all this, sometimes they probably aren't. If you tell your teenage daughter or son that they're not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it contains, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Since nothing is censored on the internet, if you're all about censorship, you should avoid going onto the internet. Adults do not need censorship. They are grown - ups, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read. Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes necessary. There should be well - defined sections for children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written with a certain age limit in mind, so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not you're going to be able to read a book or watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So, censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I believe in censorship, but to others, it's a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brutally murdered and there's cussing every other word. Music can come in both uncensored and censored versions, it just depends on what you want to hear. In conclusion, censorship is a complex issue that is either loved or hated, and it all boils down to personal opinion. We should respect different views while also ensuring that appropriate content is available for different age groups.
593	3570	2	3	Each book in a library bears its own unique relation to each person that enters that library. Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something that a large group of people should decide. Every person has a distinct outlook on what makes a story interesting. There will never be a book that every human being agrees is both appropriate and engaging. Since people are designed with distinctly different minds, they want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors. People should maintain the right to choose which books they want to read. Never will one book bind the world. The minds of human beings are too complexly separated. For example, reading 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee in my English class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class. Books dealing with racism, religion, and sexual content can either intrigue a person's mind or disgust them. Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree on simply won't ever be possible. There will always be that one person who refuses to agree. It is a choice. It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read. If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom? Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the Christian faith will not be tolerated by the reader. Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point. To others, however, it makes them lose interest in the story. A choice should remain a person's right; especially when it comes to reading a book written to be read. Finding an appropriate book is not the problem. That has yet to become the problem. The only real problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling. I find 'The Catcher in the Rye' to be dangerously inappropriate. However, it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions. Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content. Do I find it offensive to some? No, but I understand where others could find it offensive. There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it won't be offensive to every person who reads it. To reiterate, the human mind is unique and doesn't align with others. In conclusion, every person should be given the choice to read what they desire. By giving people this choice, the rebellion will subside. Removing a book from a shelf just makes certain people more eager to read it, sometimes out of pure rebellion. Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf every time someone wants one banned will leave no books for anyone. As a person, I am well - aware of my own mind's needs, and it desires the freedom of choice. Every human mind desires the freedom to choose. So, we should give people the choice, remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they may be interested in. Let readers have their freedom.
594	3571	2	3	In society today, people perceive things in very many different ways. So, things that might be helpful to one person may offend another. In libraries, there are various kinds of books, such as fiction and non - fiction. So, if you don't like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf just because the book has offended a few people. We are fortunate to live in the United States, where we have the freedom of speech. So, authors have the freedom to write what they would like to. They spend long, hard hours getting a book ready to be published, and then someone wants to take it off the shelf because it offended a few people? I do not think that is right. 'One man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote fits this topic very well, because a book may not mean anything to one person but could mean the world to someone else. You never know what people might need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a turning point in his/her life and is ready to change, and there's a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book may offend a few people, but it could save a family, a friendship, or maybe even a life. Take Anne Frank for instance, her journal is now a book. Now this may offend a few people who might have been there or maybe don't like Nazi Germany, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and I understand that maybe you don't want your 10 - year - old to hear about how they used to treat Jewish women, but the story has the right to be told and should be told. I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library just because it has offended a few. There are lots of different kinds of books. If the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book. By respecting the diversity of opinions and the rights of authors, we can ensure that a wide range of stories and ideas are available for everyone to explore, and that the freedom of expression is maintained in our society.
595	3572	2	3	I think a lot of books are good to read because some of them will tell you things you didn't know before. Therefore, you might pick up a book that you like and read it, and you may like it, but it might not have much deeper meaning in what you're reading. A lot of books you read have some type of character in them that might talk about something that's opposite to what another character is saying. Magazines can sometimes show you what a person's lifestyle is like. Some books that people read have no action or emotion in them, so they can just pick up and read the book. It's always good to pick up a reasonable book so that someone can read a book that is positive and would mean something to other people who read the same book. I think the best book is one that tells you about life and what you need to know to succeed in life. You may come across a book that is true and get really into it so you can learn something from what you read and even write about it on an essay paper. A magazine and movie - related book often show a lot of action and what it's like in certain situations. Most people might think it's boring to read a book without action, so they get a book that has action to excite them more than a regular book. But most books with a lot of action have more pictures than words in them. You should pick a book off the shelf that has what you need to know about because action - packed books might not always be helpful. The more action - filled and fun books you read may not be as good as what another book is presenting in a story. In conclusion, when choosing a book, we should consider both the entertainment value and the knowledge it can provide. We should look for books that can offer something meaningful and help us grow, rather than just focusing on action or other superficial aspects.
596	3573	2	3	In our society today, there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes. Items, such as books, movies, and other media, should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it. Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason, then there would be a very limited selection left. Students might take advantage of this and try to have educational books removed. Removing items from shelves removes history. Our history books tell us stories of slavery and discrimination. If someone takes offense to this and has it removed, then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again. Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out. If you take offense to an item in the library, then you do not have to read it. Something that you might take as offensive could be something that inspires and encourages someone else. Whether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion, and decisions should not be made based on someone's opinion alone. Think about it. If you have a favorite book, movie, or song, then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someone's opinion? You have the right to be able to read, watch, or listen to whatever you want. It should not be limited based on someone else's opinion. It would cause much argument among people. Some have different opinions than others on a certain item in the library, which will lead to argument and possible violence. There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there, and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them. If items are removed based on someone's opinion, then there will be a very limited selection left. People read for enjoyment and knowledge. They deserve to have a wide selection to choose from. In our society today, there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes. Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something. If they take offense to it, then they have the right to ignore it. There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation. We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through. We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them. Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it. In conclusion, respecting diverse opinions and allowing access to a wide range of materials is essential for a healthy and informed society.
597	3574	2	3	Practice what you preach. The United States is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the 1700s, people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In the United States, we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc., it would defeat the entire purpose of the United States and its democratic values. Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject. That's why it's wonderful that there is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things, then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know what or what not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things,' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination. I agree that for children, there should be warnings for material that parents might find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course, it's up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations, but banning something all together is not necessary. I personally learned a lot of things from what I've seen on television. What's on television might be considered 'street smart' education, but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored, then people would not know what to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen it before. If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves, then the United States is not practicing what it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom. In conclusion, maintaining freedom of expression and providing appropriate guidance for children are crucial for upholding the principles of a free society.
598	3575	2	3	Censorship should play a major part in which books should enter and leave the library. That's why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or CD should definitely be removed from the shelf if it is found offensive to at least ten children. Now it would be asking too much to have the librarian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about. So, therefore, a library should have a certain section that if a librarian thinks that there might be some bad language or reference to drugs or alcohol, then that book should go into that part of the library. I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I don't think a little kid should be reading, but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the librarian. Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for. Just because the movie has a title that doesn't seem that bad doesn't mean that there won't be any graphic images in that movie, or that there won't be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie. Now since movies are a lot easier to review and since they also have a rating, then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not. But there should definitely be a part in the library that if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children, then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room. Music would be another thing you would definitely have to watch out for because with each song, it could change how the language is in that CD. So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and personally listen to that CD before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to. But personally, I think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new CD album that an artist makes, he could easily change how his wording is in the songs. So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music. One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words. Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, CDs, or movies categorized by age. As a child gets older, he will be taught more about certain things. Then once he picks up that book and sees that it's mentioned in the book, it won't be that big of a shock to him or his parents. With the way things are today, it's almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence. So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence, then there would be nothing left on the shelves for kids to listen to or read. You're not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or CD that has something to do with violence or alcohol use. But you can take some of the stuff that has a lot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf. By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that might seem inappropriate for children will definitely make a big difference, and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a CD and hears the artist mention something about that. Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violence. So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf, there would be no games left for kids to play. So there are just some things that contain violence that you just can't keep your child from seeing at one point in time. All the games have a rating on them, so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game. By doing that, you will be able to somewhat control what your child will see, and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available. So I have pretty much covered about how whoever is in charge of the games, books, movies, and CDs should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf. You don't have to censor everything, but there are definitely some things out there that should not be put out on the shelves for little kids to look at or listen to. And if a little kid wants to get a game, a parent should have to look at the game and the rating of the game to determine if that child is mature enough to handle what goes on in that game. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship, including age - categorization and parental guidance, can help protect children while still allowing access to a diverse range of materials.
599	3576	2	3	Do I believe that some books should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive? Well, what do you think? I think they should, depending on the cause or what degree of the party being offended. I feel if there are books, movies, or music that are saying or showing a form of insults, then it depends on who is being offended. If you have a racist book against all races like blacks, Asian, or Mexican, etc., other minorities might find out about those forms of insults, and they raise an issue about it. Then, yes, take it off the shelves. If you have a confrontation about it, then it could get violent. Also, if you don't, then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library, and you would lose business. So, to avoid all of the fighting and lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorities, if they bring up a situation, then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well. Plus, they only come here for an opportunity to start a new life because usually they're coming from poverty - stricken towns, home countries. I myself am not a racist person. I think that we are equal, just unique individuals. We're all unique in our own ways, and that is what makes us who we are today. In conclusion, being sensitive to the feelings of minorities and taking appropriate action to remove offensive materials is not only a moral obligation but also a practical step to maintain a harmonious and inclusive environment.
600	3577	2	3	Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people might believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others might disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away. If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who might enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy. For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly disappointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, I would be crushed. I am also aware that people might just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies, and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters, and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an iPod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazines might require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game. We can't just go around removing everything we don't like because it is not fair to those who might like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts, and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them. In conclusion, finding a balance between personal preferences and the well - being of others, especially children, through methods like censorship and parental guidance is the key to a diverse and inclusive cultural environment.
601	3578	2	3	Today in society, there are indeed many things on which people hold different views. These differences can stem from various aspects such as religion, race, or being brought up in a distinct way. Today, libraries are filled with a vast array of books of all types. These books can relate to all different kinds of people, catering to diverse interests and perspectives. If one book is found to be discriminating against another individual, the question arises: is this right? I firmly believe that libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things as they have been for several valid reasons. First off, no one is the same. What might be considered bad to someone else can be good to another person. If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music, they don't have to read, watch, or listen to it. Since no one is the same, what someone might not find appealing can be an amazing thing to another person. Second, these materials can serve a purpose. The @LOCATION2 wasn't always an equal place. If there are books that talk about the discrimination of other races, I think it's simply showing history. If we didn't have history to look back on, we wouldn't be able to see how @LOCATION1 has progressed, from slave states to all free states. I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can be looked upon. Third, a library is supposed to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music, etc. If we were to take everything out of the libraries that comes off as offensive, it wouldn't be a place where you could find things that you wanted. It would probably be a boring place. If there's no variety in a library, I don't see how it can be called a library. You can find whatever you're looking for in a library, whether it's on how to do hair to the history of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. In conclusion, these reasons make up why libraries should stay the way they are. One is because what might be offensive to an individual might be different to someone else. Second, it would take a lot away from history. Third, it wouldn't make a library what it is today. These are legitimate reasons why it should be left alone.
602	3579	2	3	In our public libraries, we can find books that are related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution, and violence. These books all contain the history of our past. We, as a society, cannot forget our past because, as many historians say, history repeats itself. If we start censoring our libraries, then all that history will be forgotten and/or lost. Libraries can assist us in numerous ways. They help us with school projects, business projects, and they enhance our knowledge as individuals. You cannot go censoring the libraries just because someone finds a book offensive. The stories of slavery are still taken offensively among people @DATE1, but if we start taking stories about people who have been enslaved and hide them from the people, we will slip back into that terrible past. There are gang stories of terrifying people, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He killed many people, destroyed many shops, and probably even sold a lot of drugs. We need history to show our weakness as a nation and not hide because of this weakness but thrive on it to better our cities, improve our police training, and most importantly, raise the next generation of kids better. There is more than just books at the public library; there are also movies and documentaries of our nation and the @CAPS3. Movies that talk about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2. These types of movies can show how horrifying @CAPS4 really is and how cruel people can get. During @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2, there was the @CAPS9 where six million Jews lost their lives because one person, @PERSON2, did not like them. People made movies like those to show the @CAPS3 how devastating man can be, but people have also made movies on amazing discoveries and amazing places. For example, @PERSON1, one of the greatest findings among the @CAPS3. Music can also be a great way to better oneself. If you play an instrument and you need music to play to, why not go to the library to get some? You don't have to worry about paying for a @MONEY1 cd and you can use it until you're done with it and then return it. Then, with how advanced our technological knowledge is, people can get cd's to burn onto a computer and put on their iPod or @NUM4 player. Plus, the library is a good place to just go look for music you like. So, should there be censorship in our libraries? NO! There should not, and the key reason as to why is because it is history. History of our country, history of our @CAPS3, and history of sad and hard times. Instead of censoring our youth of @DATE1 from history, we need to set age limits. Young people of a certain age can not read certain books unless they are with a parent or guardian. That is one simple way to keep our kids from reading overly mature things but still able to get the history he/she needs because, as historians always say, history repeats itself and as a growing nation, we need to better ourselves in every way possible. The answer to that is through our history.
603	3580	2	3	I don't think books that would offend people should be on the shelf. Some of the books that might be on the shelf @MONTH1 can hurt someone's feelings. But I also think people should be able to read what they want to read. Many people wouldn't read a book that they think would offend them. There are various kinds of books, and not all books will be bad or offensive. However, books that are not appropriate for young kids or teens shouldn't even be in school libraries. In public libraries, I think it should be okay to have every type of book, and they should have different books in different places. For example, having a young adult section and an adult and children section. I think certain books should be sold in specific bookstores. I don't think inappropriate books should be in children's bookstores. They should have a separate store for such books. And parents should monitor what their children are reading and take part in the book - reading process by helping them understand what the book is saying. There are lots of parents who don't really care about what their kids read, and to me, that's their business. But my opinion is that they shouldn't let their kids read whatever they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, I think they would be old enough to choose what they want to read. By the time they are that age, they have matured enough to read and understand things much easier. In conclusion, a balanced approach with proper categorization in libraries and parental involvement can ensure that everyone has access to suitable reading materials.
604	3581	2	3	"Hi, I'm Henry, and I firmly agree that if there are books in a school library or a public library that are offensive, they should be removed. I'm a type of person who believes that offensive books shouldn't be in libraries because I hate seeing people upset or mad because they read a book that offended them. That includes magazines, movies, and even music. I, Henry, have read a few books that have offended me or made fun of black people, and I have black friends. If I could have it my way, I would have all books like that out of school libraries and public libraries. And I say that because little kids don't need to be reading that kind of stuff, and neither do we. That's just like music nowadays. You turn on a radio station, and people are cussing and making fun of other colored people. Also, you can't understand what they're saying half the time. They need to put on music that you can understand, that doesn't have cussing in it, and that you can enjoy because some kids like to listen to music. Magazines - I look at a lot of magazines myself, but they're all like coon - hunting magazines or four - wheeler ones looking for tires or something like that. But yes, also the bad magazines need to go. That way, little kids aren't looking at them. Also, it might help some crime to stop. I say that because people look at magazines that have shooting and crime in them. So people see that and think, ""I wanna try this sometime."" Then they call their buddies and say, ""Let's try this,"" and most of them do, and then they're in trouble. So I think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away, and things might change. Make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids. You could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens. To me, things would possibly change if we get all the naughty things out of books, magazines, and music. Movies - this is a big one. Just about all the movies are bad. There are some good ones out there if you look. But I don't know how we could change the movies by any chance at all. That was my opinion on things. I hope it all makes sense about how I feel and how I think about things. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from libraries, magazines, music, and movies can have a positive impact on society, especially on the younger generation."
605	3582	2	3	"Why censor something that someone worked hard on? People invest a significant amount of money and countless hours to write this, and yet you want to censor it. See, there is honestly no need to censor anything in the library because there are certain sections for certain people. Therefore, this whole conversation shouldn't be going on in the first place. People just like to nit - pick about what they can not handle. For instance, like the word ""nigger"", I don't like it at all, but I can handle it, and therefore I just shut my mouth and tolerate it. So I just feel like all the critics and all the immature people just need not to read or don't go to the library, but that's only my view. So stop acting like little children. The authors want their stuff on the shelves and not being banned, and having people rant and rave about them. In conclusion, stop being immature. If you don't like it, don't read it. Always think to yourself about what you're doing before you decide. We should respect the hard work of the authors and the diversity of content in libraries, allowing individuals to make their own choices about what to engage with."
606	3583	2	3	I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I think offensive books, movies, music, and so on should be removed from the shelves because that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something inappropriate, it's okay to watch. I would not want my brother or sister to watch or see anything that is not appropriate. I remember there was a time when I was thirteen years old, and my mom and step - dad at the time did not agree that I should have @PERSON1, @CAPS1, or @NUM1 on my television. They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on @CAPS2, and it was inappropriate in their opinion. I disagreed with that. I thought I should have the right to watch it because I liked the shows and they were interesting to watch. In my opinion, not everything that was on @CAPS2 was as bad. When I would watch music videos on @CAPS1, every song that was being played was the edited version. I had to argue and prove a point about why I should have @NUM2, @NUM1 on my @CAPS2. Parents all have a different opinion about what is good and what is bad for their children. In my case, my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad. She knew what it was like when she was young. She thought that maybe I would think what I see on @CAPS2 is not a bad thing. I was thinking to myself that oh well, I am young and I will eventually learn in the long run what is good and what is bad. Ultimately, while parents and children may have different views, a balance should be struck to ensure that children learn and grow while being protected from overly inappropriate content.
607	3584	2	3	TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2. Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point. The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One thing that is offensive to a person may not be offensive to another. I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community. Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre. The reader should know where he or she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended. Maturity comes with understanding. Books are sorted by genre. Most, if not all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre. The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor. When @CAPS2, an author must take this into consideration. For example, if the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D., the author would not want to use grammar from the present day. The reader should be informed on what books they may read before doing so. From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution. Maturity comes with understanding. If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2, then the book corresponds with the age of that child. This is why I strongly believe that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community. Instead, we should focus on educating readers about different contexts and promoting understanding.
608	3585	2	3	Should we take off books that are offensive? I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive. If we do take off the offensive stuff off the shelf, then there will be hardly anything left on the shelf. If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that is offensive to us, then there will be no books, movies, or music on the shelf. First of all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the shelf. All the hippies will take the war - related stuff off because they don't like war. They will say that it is offensive to them and take them off. I think that we should read about war and watch war - related content because it is a good way to learn from our mistakes. If we don't learn the mistakes of war, we will lose and we won't learn how we lost. Then we will go into war over and over again, winning some but losing a lot because we won't learn from our losses. Secondly, all the music that is both good and bad in some people's eyes will be taken off the shelf. All the overly - protective mothers will take them down because the music has bad language and a bad theme. If they take them down, how can the football players, soldiers, and fighters get pumped up for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to? Finally, they will take out all the books of Star Wars and Forgotten Realms. Some people don't like them because they think that it won't come true and they will take them out, saying that it is offensive to their way of thinking. Star Wars is a great book and movie series, and Forgotten Realms is a well - known book - making company. All of this is why I don't want this to happen. All the good music, books, and movies will go away, and the people who like them will get mad. We should respect different tastes and not let a few people's sensitivities ruin things for everyone.
609	3586	2	3	Everyone can think of something that they did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve? What if @NUM1 people came into a library with @NUM2 books, magazines, music, and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out, even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like. If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it, should they have to demolish it just like that? The world would have never - ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse. I have encountered problems between people who do not agree on throwing out or keeping an item. One solution could be to just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item, they could. Otherwise, have separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges. If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people, you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy. We should strive for a more inclusive and understanding environment.
610	3587	2	3	Yes, I believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in them, such as racial slurs or disrespecting the race of any human. But the music part is up in the air. For example, kids hearing songs with cussing and talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldn't be the sole reason to remove the music. The way I see it, everybody's gonna learn about it somehow. When you hear songs multiple times, you tend to begin to know the words. And if you repeat the words in front of a parent, that's when they can step into the parenting role and tell them that the drugs and bad words are not good. Really, though, if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says, then they should know right from wrong by then. Clearly, if someone is using bad language such as the @CAPS1 word, they would know that it's wrong. And if they continue to listen to it, that's on them. In conclusion, while we need to be cautious about inappropriate content in books and music, we also need to trust in the ability of children to learn and the role of parents to guide them.
611	3588	2	3	If I were to write to a newspaper, I'd say that our children should not be looking at certain books and those books should be taken off the shelf. The reason I say that is so our children are not getting ideas from a book that is not appropriate for them. I think that is the main reason there are more girls getting pregnant at a young age. I think if we were to take off the inappropriate books, there would be fewer girls getting pregnant. I really think it could work if we were to take all of the inappropriate books off the shelf and make it a law that you had to be a certain age to look at them. I would like to see a change in the way we look at inappropriate books. I think you should be [appropriate age] to look at books that are inappropriate. It would be a good thing to try for a while. I think it would work because it would not be shown to our children and they would not want to have babies as teenagers. This is the way I think it should have been done in the first place. We would not have so many problems in the first place. The thing is, I think they don't think it will be too hard to raise a child at a young age. If we would not have to see things that we shouldn't have seen, our children would grow up in a more suitable environment.
612	3589	2	3	Censorship is a growing problem in today's world of literature. Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to. Katherine Paterson says that if we were all allowed to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about. Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society. In the novel 'Fahrenheit 451', censorship is one of the main themes of the story. Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions. Guy Montag finds that the burning of books has led the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them. The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in the hope that it would make for a happier society. When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy. Guy Montag decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not exercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless. So when he tries to memorize a part of the Bible, he cannot retain what he has been reading. Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn. The members of this novel's society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world. What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day. In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved. In a normal society, learning leads to questioning. But for them there is no learning, just accepting. And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness. The society in 'Fahrenheit 451' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways. To them, death is not a big deal. Clarisse McClellan was killed by a speeding car, and Mildred, Montag's wife, was not even shocked to hear it. Another example is when Guy Montag was running from the police, and a car full of rambunctious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to. At the end of the novel, Guy Montag is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes. The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them every day! A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed. Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer. Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about. Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenager's mind at least once. But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well. In conclusion, censorship has far - reaching negative impacts on society, and we should approach it with more rationality.
613	3590	2	3	Do I think that if books, movies, music, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves just because they are offensive? No, I don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just because someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this: if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelf because I think it's offensive or this or that, then we wouldn't have anything to watch, listen to, or even read. I understand that yes, people do have rights and their beliefs on something, but it doesn't mean that they have any say - so on what should stay or what should go. If we let people do this, then nobody would be able to watch, read, play, or even listen to for fun. We people use these things for having something to keep us entertained. Let's say this: we all know how little children have their imagination and they use that to keep them entertained just like us older people use books, music, movies, and etc. to keep us entertained. Well, if we don't have this stuff, then we would be lost and won't know what to do without that stuff. Just think of our little kids if we take their imagination away, then they would be lost and hopeless because that's how they learn and grow up. We people use this every - day use not only to keep us entertained but to also help us learn more about whatever we need to learn about to survive in every - day life. See, in ways we are not so different from our children at all really. They use whatever they find or see to keep them entertained and for enjoyment. If people really thought about what they are really going to do by removing something from the shelves, then they would regret that what they did was stupid because now they don't have anything to read, listen to, or even watch. I, my own self, had an experience on what it's like to have something like that pulled down from the shelves before and it's really not cool at all for that to happen. Taking something off the shelves that is a little bit offensive doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves. I think that if people who took something off the shelves just because one person thought that it was offensive are wrong and should not take something down that maybe other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down before even reading it yourself is stupid on behalf of your part because maybe other people like it and maybe you like it, who knows. I just think that people should really think before they go and take something off the shelves without having a lot of people giving you a bad comment on it before just taking one person's opinion on it. In conclusion, we should be more tolerant and rational when it comes to deciding whether to remove so - called 'offensive' materials.
614	3591	2	3	Offensive or Acceptable? Who can truly say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truly offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive? While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The Bible' and nothing more. Make - believe and imagination was not a suitable thing for their child to read. For many families, though the Harry Potter series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should. While my family loves the books and movies, some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would hardly be interesting, and there would be no music. If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would hardly have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on Elvis Presley's rock - and - roll and mine is of hip - hop, rap&pop, electronic. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a bookstore. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look. Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scenes in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make - believe world of Harry Potter, and I believe that somewhere out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact. People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is no one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of a public place. In conclusion, we should respect different views and not overly censor based on individual offense.
615	3592	2	3	As said before, there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered - down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages, but there is much advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should separate their books only as they do already. Some material does seem to be advanced for others, but these materials are needed to advance academic growth. Some people think that school should not read Mark Twain due to racism in the south. This was true history, so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those sorts of restrictions, then schools would lack much of history's best literature. Just as the movies do for the general population, R - rated movies are for 17 and up while PG - 13 is for 13 and up. These are good standards that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem. Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sections up more than they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main categories that most people want separated due to offensive material such as drugs, sex, and alcohol. Much of the media that is public today is censored and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the youth can stunt them academically. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their existing categorization and we should strike a balance between protecting the youth and promoting academic growth.
616	3593	2	3	Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people? In my opinion, there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons, like during certain seasons or cultural contexts, include: the put - down on races, inappropriate comments in the book, how the author wrote it with a biased or insensitive tone, and who it was written towards. Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the derogatory terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personally. Music can be offensive to some people because of the vulgar language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children, especially during their impressionable years, listen to it, and children nowadays say things they hear from music and try to be like the person saying it. Movies can be offensive because of the harsh language, excessive violence, and the demeaning way people are treated. A good movie would be [Specific Movie Name]. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall, the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today. Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting a hold of things like that. Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way, everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is to take everything that's offensive, they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are offensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore, it's not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it.
617	3594	2	3	Censorship? What is it? Well, from what I know, censorship is where you are blocked from certain things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it. So the question is, is it wrong to censor something or not? I think that libraries should be able to censor certain things that people find offensive. First reason why I think it is right that people should be able to censor things is because little children could be able to take a peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies. For instance, in some magazines, there could be inappropriate advertisements or in movies, there might be disturbing scenes. Next reason why I think libraries should be able to censor is because people can find certain things offensive just as music, for example, like vulgar language can be listened to and also naughty things can be watched in movies. My last reasoning why I think it is fair that libraries are able to censor things is because some people like to read but in their reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a library. These are reasons why I think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines. My first reasoning in why I think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little children could be able to look at things they should not be able to take a peek at. These things could be like pornography, and also really gruesome things in magazines and in movies. If these things were in libraries they can possibly show other children, which it would not be good. This can be a problem because parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children. Also, I think they should be able to censor movies because little children should not be watching gruesome movies at a young age. This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on these movies and magazines. Also, libraries can censor music. I also think libraries can censor music because in music these days there are very bad things that anybody can find that is offensive. Little children can be listening to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people. This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying, so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners. Also, they should be able to censor movies again because naughty things can be shown in those movies that certain age levels should not be able to see. These are reasons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies. They also have the right to censor books. Books in the libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certain books such as books about faith and other religions. And also about gruesome items. Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people, due to their different beliefs and backgrounds, do not see eye to eye about other religions. And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so people won't find it to be offensive. And also libraries should be censoring certain books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive. So this is why I think libraries should be able to censor things. In conclusion, libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death, movies because in some movies it can show pornography and gruesome things that people should not be watching, and they should be able to censor magazines and music because in magazines children could be looking at certain things they should not be looking at. And they should be able to censor music because people can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language. So in other words, I do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines.
618	3595	2	3	Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, it makes it hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some, depending on their personalities and life experiences, enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries. Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a clear warning sign in the areas where those materials are located. On the back of movies there is a rating on how bad the movie is. Why not put a rating on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read them. It would also help them decide if they even want to read them. Ratings on the back of magazines and books would help distinguish what age is appropriate for them. Once, when I was visiting the library, there was a man in the check - out line, right before me. He was returning the book that he had just read and checking out the new one he had already picked out. When it was finally his turn in line he stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what he had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that he wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, 'How did you like your book, [Name]?' He replied 'It wasn't what I expected. It was completely inappropriate.' As they discussed a little more it turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of how people don't know what to expect when they read a book. I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people may not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others may find it outrageous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find it offensive? No one makes those people read those books, it's by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reassure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by it.
619	3596	2	3	Should They or Should They Not? What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about their appearance or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should not be hearing this or having to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion, I do not think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them how to be like that? One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. It's better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though, a lot of kids have to listen to their parents fight and yell. So, why don't they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to? There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelves. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That gets me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your children get it. As being a teenager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldn't be listening to, but even if my daughter was [Age] there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what their child gets just because they don't care, well that's not your problem. There should, however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get with parent permission or not. Books with sex scenes and murder should not be allowed into the [Age] year - old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldn't be allowed to read something that adults do. Most [Age] year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen pregnancy. As much as they should get information on it, have their parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and a lot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they haven't done anything so far is because not enough parents care. This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing. This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why aren't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age - worthy or not. Last but not least, try to talk your librarian into making groups of books. Some for the younger kids some for the older. It wouldn't kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and not just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and not let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!! Make a say!!
620	3597	2	3	Some people think that offensive books should be off the shelves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed. I do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines). If we take every book off the shelf then we would not have any book to read. If we start taking offensive books off the shelf then every person coming in would be taking multiple books off the shelf. Then within two days there would be no books left. If we do not have any books then our eyes would be bad because reading is a good exercise for our eyes. We should not take books off the shelves because some people like to read. Reading is a form of entertainment and knowledge acquisition for them. If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books. This is why people should not take offensive books off the shelves. Taking offensive books off the shelves will make people miss out on various forms of literature and it will also lead to a situation where there are very few books left in the library. This will make people's eyes so bad that they would not see good at all as they lose the opportunity to engage in healthy reading habits.
621	3598	2	3	Reading it is a pleasure for some and a chore for others. When considering whether objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or removed from the shelves, it's clear that there are some materials that could undergo censorship, while others would lose their value if censored. Indeed, I firmly believe that there are items in the library that could benefit from censorship. I'm going to explain the reasons for censorship and what types of content should be censored.   There are certain types of library items that should not be subject to cleanup. For instance, historical documentaries or historical books have no other way to convey the necessary information to the reader or viewer. However, there are other library items that could be censored. Some magazines and movies display uncensored scenes or pages that aren't necessary to convey a message, even if there is one to be conveyed. I think a movie, book, or magazine should only remain uncensored if it's trying to make a valid point. If uncensored items aren't getting a point across, they have no place in the library.   As we can see, there are circumstances where an uncensored book, movie, or magazine is extremely useful for obtaining information. But there are more situations where a library item doesn't need uncensored details because they're simply offensive. If you ask me whether censorship is important in libraries, I'd have to say it's a yes - and - no answer. I've just provided some reasons for this stance. The next time you're in the library looking for a book, ask yourself one question: Is it too offensive to be valuable? By carefully considering these factors, we can strike a balance between access to information and a suitable library environment.
622	3599	2	3	Have you ever imagined going to the library and picking up a magazine from the shelf only to find it offensive, and being unable to do anything about it? Well, now you can voice your concerns. Katherine Paterson and I visited a library together. We selected a magazine from the shelf, and it contained a lot of offensive content that we didn't like. We approached the lady at the front desk, and she was completely unaware that such magazines were there. She got really angry and went back to the shelf, only to discover that there were many magazines with offensive writing, pictures, and even comments. We gathered all of those magazines and threw them away.   In my opinion, offensive things like movies, music, and magazines should be removed. They should be removed because they're a bad influence on the youth. They plant ideas in the young minds, and later, the youth might act on them, say inappropriate things in public, or even do them at home. These offensive materials are getting a lot of people into trouble, making them imitate what they see. This is particularly affecting kids, making them more violent towards their schoolmates, friends, and even their moms.   We need to remove all these offensive materials because they're everywhere and easy to find. In movies, for example, it's reached the point where you see naked girls in almost every film. Parents also have a role to play. They're the ones buying these materials and leaving them around the house, making it easy for children to access them.   We have to be more careful about what we buy or read. You might find something offensive, and if your kids read it, they'll form the wrong ideas. So, the next time you buy something or go somewhere and find something offensive, talk to the manager or supervisor about removing it. That's why I firmly believe these offensive materials should be removed to protect the well - being of our youth and create a more appropriate environment.
623	3600	2	3	Parents should inform their kids about what they're allowed to read at certain ages. This is where my opinion begins, and I'll explain why I hold this view. I'll discuss why I disagree with the idea that parents should have absolute control over what books are available in libraries, and provide reasons for my stance.   I truly believe that anyone should be able to read the kind of books they like. The library is the source for these books. Just because a parent doesn't want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean the book shouldn't be in the library. Parents need to explain to their children the reasons why they don't want them to read a particular book.   If parents take the time to explain, kids will understand why the book isn't suitable for them. Those types of books are often favored by older people and are quite interesting. I think if people understand the content of a book and it doesn't bother them, then they're old enough to read it. Also, young kids who shouldn't be reading these books should be accompanied by an adult or guardian. This way, the adult can prevent the child from reading inappropriate content.   Another issue that concerns many people is not being able to access a book just because some parents don't like it. This is taking away our right, and we shouldn't have to buy a book just to read it once. If these books are so terrible, why are people still writing them? If they haven't caused significant problems so far, there's no reason for people to suddenly object to them. People should be able to do what they enjoy without having that right taken away.   This is my opinion on the matter. Many people may not agree, but I've tried to make them see my perspective. By understanding different viewpoints, we can work together to ensure that people's rights to access books are protected, and that the community can continue to enjoy the benefits of a diverse library collection.
624	3601	2	3	Television, news, drama, life, and controversy. These are just a few of the themes that books are written about. Some subjects are regarded as vulgar and inappropriate for young audiences. Many people believe that their children have the right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really a good idea? Books have long been an important tool for students. However, not all books are suitable for all audiences. Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, while other stories about the darker aspects of life are usually kept away from children.   Books are censored for various reasons. Some of these reasons are trivial and shouldn't prevent a book from reaching its full potential. The truth is, there's a line that shouldn't be crossed, and some books cross this line and get banned. That's appropriate. However, some books that don't 'cross the line' are banned anyway. Honestly, careful consideration must be given before deciding to ban a book or keep it on the shelves.   If a book written by a recognized author contains only minor obscenities and is banned, the author may not face serious pressure as the banning will be well - known, and consumers may still buy the book out of curiosity. However, if a relatively unknown author writes a well - crafted piece with a few somewhat vulgar references, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble. This author can no longer have their book in libraries, which means their work may never be recognized. Banning books is preventing authors from making a name for themselves.   Books that are extremely vulgar should definitely be banned. No child should be reading a book intended solely for adults. Children should be protected from such material, and book banning serves this purpose. If a child really wants to read a banned book, they can ask their parents to buy it, assuming the parents think it's okay for children to read such filthy books.   If a book can spark good discussion in a classroom and is mostly 'clean', it should be available to everyone. Just because a book has a few inappropriate references doesn't mean students shouldn't read it. If the learning material a book offers outweighs the potential negative effects on a student, the book should be accessible. However, since it's difficult to effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a complex decision.   In conclusion, while book banning can protect children from inappropriate material, it also has a negative impact on authors. We need to find a middle ground where we can ensure that children are protected while also allowing authors to share their work. By carefully evaluating each book, we can make more informed decisions about banning and availability.
625	3602	2	3	I believe there should not be censorship in libraries. If someone needs to read a book about a particular topic and the library doesn't have it because the library staff doesn't believe in or like what the book has to say, the reader is deprived of the opportunity to learn the actual facts.   The first reason I believe there should be no censorship in libraries is that many students go to libraries to study for papers. If the library doesn't have the book a student is looking for, it fails in its main purpose of providing access to information.   The second reason is that just because the person in charge of the library doesn't like a book, it doesn't mean they have to prevent others from reading it. Books are meant for everyone to read.   The third reason is that a library is supposed to have a wide range of books so that people can access the information they need. If the owner removes a book and someone needs that specific book but can't get the information from it, the library is failing in its primary function.   The fourth reason is that many people read books to learn about different things. Just because an individual doesn't like what a book says doesn't give them the right to remove it from the library.   These are the main reasons I think libraries should not have censorship. The owner of the library should strive to have as many books as possible and not choose to exclude a book just because they don't like its content. By maintaining an uncensored library, we can ensure that everyone has equal access to knowledge and different perspectives, which is essential for a well - informed society.
626	3603	2	3	I am neutral on this subject because it does not matter to me whether they put new books, movies, music cds, or magazines on their shelves or if they take them off. Whether it's a brand - new best - selling novel, the latest blockbuster movie, trendy music cds, or interesting magazines, the addition or removal makes no difference to me. Also it does not matter to me if I have to pay for the things that I check out from the library. Whether it's a small fee or a reasonable charge, I'm okay with it. Also it does not matter at all if I had to pay a late fee for the books that I checked out from the library. Even if the late fee is a bit high, it won't bother me. Also I do not care about any noises that go on in the library. Whether it's the soft whispers or the occasional rustling of pages, it doesn't affect me. Also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library. Be it classic literature, modern fiction, or non - fiction, I'm indifferent. Also it would not matter to me how the library is run. Whether it has a strict policy or a more relaxed one, I'm fine. Also I would not care if I had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me. Whether there's a strict silence rule or a bit more leniency, it makes no difference. Also I would not care how long that I would stay in the library. Whether it's an hour or a whole day, I'm not concerned. Also it would not matter to me if I walked or drove or rode my bike to the library. Whether it's a short walk, a drive in the car, or a bike ride, I don't mind. Also I would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it. Even if the policy seems a bit off, I won't object. Also if I got kicked out of the library I would just go to another one. And that's just how I feel about it. Finally, it would not matter to me if I got ten books or movies from the library I would not care. Thoma.
627	3604	2	3	I think that the books should not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they don't like the book they should leave it. People have the ability to make their own choices when it comes to reading. If they pick up a book and find it unappealing, they can simply put it back on the shelf. There is no reason that the people would want to remove any book for any reason because a lot of people like different kinds of books. Everyone has their own unique taste in literature. If they would remove any books, there would be a lot of people mad because those people might of really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it. That particular book could have been a favorite, and they might hope to share it with others. That book might of also been in their family for a really long time and they want everyone in their family to enjoy that book. It could be a family heirloom in the literary sense. It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books and that would cost more money to get more books. Buying new books requires a financial investment. It will also waste more paper. Producing new books means using more paper resources. Another reason that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book to replace the old one, the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money and will not be good for them. The business could suffer financially. So that's what I think would be my opinion about removing a book. It would not turn out very good and the book store will lose a lot of money because they got rid of a good book and brought back a really bad book.
628	3605	2	3	Censorship in Libraries Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society. Many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come across a book from the early @DATE1's? In these times, there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today. But what most people don't understand is that these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. For example, certain slang terms that were used casually then are now considered offensive. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un - appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who don't like this piece of literature, go against the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where I am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away. When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come across a piece of literature that they don't completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it? Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, don't quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then I ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they don't try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf. Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature, a poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we don't agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls and much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to receive other people's opinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one opinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you. Another reason why I don't think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere should be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in today's society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us with our problems. So, now that I have told you all of my opinions on this subject, I hope that you will have a better view on the censorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers.
629	3606	2	3	Curse words, alcohol, drugs, pornographic pictures. These are all things you would not like your children to use, see, or do. They are out in the world and there is nothing that you can do to stop it. People do drugs and drink every day, but just because someone sees you doing it doesn't mean they will too. For instance, seeing an adult have a glass of wine at dinner doesn't mean a child will start drinking. People should not be shielded from the real aspects of life. When shielded as a child, they would not know what to do if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink. They @MONTH1 not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is. For example, if they are completely unaware of drugs, they might be more easily tempted when faced with the situation. Kids to a certain age deserve to know what's going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life. It won't happen to everyone but they need to know these things. It is important for parents to let their children know what is right or what is wrong. As an adolescent, they are very vulnerable to all the bad stuff that life can bring. Seeing these things in books, movies, magazines, and etc. will affect their life in some way. It is their job to show them the right path. For example, parents can have open discussions about the negative effects of drugs. A thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on. On movies, there are age restrictions that enable people at a certain age to be able to watch and people that are within those guidelines to have access. With other materials like books, music, and magazines, there is no way to deny access to people to see or read them. Parents just need to be observant to their children and see what they do. For example, they can check what books their children are borrowing from the library. Censorship is normally a bad thing, but in others it could help. For people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things, it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right. As much as people should be open and be able to have access to this information, it is also important that other people did not see it. It is still an open debate, but, in my opinion, censorship should not be done. Everyone had their own right to get and see the things they want. And we should trust in proper education and guidance rather than strict censorship.
630	3607	2	3	In libraries and bookstores worldwide, books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. For example, a horror novel is meant to scare the reader while a comedy book is to make them laugh. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader. These books appear unappealing and offensive. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval. The first reason that there should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are allowed to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in Nazi @LOCATION1. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader. For example, an adult - oriented book has its own target audience. The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it. For example, a book with complex philosophical ideas should be for mature readers. Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Though the materials found in a story @MONTH1 be horrific to a parent, it @MONTH1 be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be paralleled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. Variety is what separates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's. Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.
631	3608	2	3	Well, do you truly think that every single book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? Who on earth can say what is offensive to everyone? Who has the right to tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you truly be your own person if other people are making decisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you precisely why I firmly believe that no certain materials such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should be taken off library shelves just because someone finds them offensive.  Who can possibly be the ultimate decision - maker in determining if something is offensive to everyone? The fact is, everyone has their own unique meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you simply say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person? I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them, that's perfectly okay; that is their own opinion. But maybe the next person that walks by and sees the so - called offensive material will absolutely love it. You should not be able to make someone else's decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music. That is their choice, not someone else's to make for them.  If every person took a book off the shelves that they thought to be offensive, then we would no longer have any books on the shelves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive, while other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting. So, what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything, and you won't agree with them either. But yet, you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and don't like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So, why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?  You can never say that any one thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can represent everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So, do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? Well, you might not, but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it. But is that fair? In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and keep the library a place where people can freely access a wide range of materials.
632	3609	2	3	Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you. He's only around @NUM1 years old, just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responsibilities. He has a natural curiosity and wants to try new things. He listens to his friends talking about drinking alcohol and how much fun it is. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He doesn't know if something is bad about it or not because no one ever told him. So, he starts to drink, and later, tragically, he dies of alcohol poisoning.  Now, you definitely don't want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are too scared to talk about the bad things in life, like sex, drugs, etc., then they should make books and movies to show how bad these things are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you might say, 'well, they're too young; they can't handle these things yet.' That's your opinion, but you should also think of their maturity level. Also, they can learn from other people's mistakes, and it would educate people.  How do you tell someone's maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes, then they're not very mature. But, you can't assume that every @NUM2 - year - old is immature. Many people take this as a serious thing. Others might not, but they still will be able to see them in their own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.  Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc., might have inappropriate things in them, like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out of libraries and off the shelves? That's a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from their mistakes. If there's a movie where a guy is doing drugs and later dies, people could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other things? It's hard to show how it's bad to say an offensive word to someone that they heard on the radio. But, when they hear that word or read about something or watch, they can ask about it, and we can say that saying those things or doing them can be offensive.  Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listen, read, or watch about something offensive or etc.? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we don't, it's bound to repeat itself. Say if we censor the Holocaust because of how horrifying it was, no one would know about it, and we would most likely repeat the Holocaust. Censoring certain things in a library would not be a good idea.  Certain people can handle talking about certain subjects. It's not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these things to educate them, and also so they can learn from what has been done and not repeat it. Also, some people can handle these materials; they just need to have a high maturity level. In conclusion, libraries should have minimal censorship to allow people to learn and grow from various materials.
633	3610	2	3	Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensive and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library?  When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I clearly noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My parents did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books, and my parents were okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' and '@PERSON1'.  Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house, my father likes country, my mother likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my uncle likes rock, and I like a combination of all of it.  That just goes to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others. If we relied on people's opinions to keep our libraries free of offense, there would be nothing in it. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and ensure that libraries have a wide - ranging collection that caters to different tastes while keeping children safe from inappropriate materials.
634	3611	2	3	If you take any of these books off the shelves, that would be like taking away some of our childhood. That wouldn't be the nicest thing to do. Even if you did take some of them off, then what would we show our children when they ask what was your favorite book as a kid?  We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore because they had to make room for other books. So, if you would please understand, we got to read all of our parents' favorite childhood books.  I mean, how would you feel if you couldn't share that with your kids? I would be upset because my parents told me about those books, and I went out and got them from the library, and I loved them so much. So, please, if you can, leave the books alone. In conclusion, these childhood books hold precious memories, and we should preserve them in libraries for future generations to enjoy.
635	3612	2	3	What is a library? A library is a place you go to that has a vast collection of books, movies, music, magazines, etc. With these things, a person can do in - depth research or simply use them for entertainment. Should there be censorship in libraries?  In my opinion, there should be very limited censorship in a library. If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library. Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good, peaceful and quiet time. While there at the library, they let their minds flow, imagine, and dream. They don't worry about being offended by a seemingly controversial book.  However, censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately. For example, moving grown - up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it. What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard. If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf, what is the point of going to the library? It would be an empty room.  If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they were offended, take the appropriate measures. For instance, if something just offended someone unintentionally, leave it where it is. But if something offends someone intentionally by their race, ethnicity, or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf.  Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on, and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar. While at the same time, you would not have to worry about being severely offended. In conclusion, a balanced approach with low - level censorship is the key to making libraries a useful and inclusive place for all.
636	3613	2	3	Censorship in Libraries To remove something a person dislikes from a library shelf is to assume that other people's opinions don't count. It truly has to depend on what the product is, such as a well - written book, an interesting magazine, a captivating music album, or an engaging movie. Usually, in any library I've walked into, there are specific sections for each type of product. In these separate sections, the products are always categorized. Not according to what people like, but by genre or age - appropriate levels. If a person were to stray from their typical section in that department and go to another part, their taste in the product will seem too different for them to like.  A local library in a person's community will have a vast array of books to read and choose from. There are colorful baby books, fun - filled kids' sections, thought - provoking teenage sections, and in - depth adults' sections as well. The teenage section is perfect for me! Although I used to always be in the kids' section not that long ago, those books should not be removed just because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up. Yet that is just my personal view. However, the younger generation will soon love them. Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be discarded for everyone else.  Music is a different story. Some people have a soft spot for country music, while others prefer alternative music. In libraries, they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to before they rent it out. When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one. The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the most beautiful music to their ears.  Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion. Yet not all parents allow their twelve - year - old to watch a rated R movie. For them, it's only PG movies. This is how I grew up. Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, I've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels. In libraries, some movies aren't allowed to be rented by a younger person. Yet it doesn't mean they should be tossed out. When they are older, they might actually enjoy them.  Overall, a person's opinion will be the most important one to them, and other opinions won't matter. Products in a library are for anyone to view, not to judge. If absolutely everyone did judge the products, there wouldn't be any left. It's essential to respect the diversity of tastes and keep the library a place of open access.
637	3614	2	3	I believe that it is unfair to ban any sort of materials from the library. It simply isn't right to withhold information from your children. Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway. Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a well - written book or a reliable magazine or hearing it in a meaningful movie or a good CD? Then they can ask parents any questions that they might have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information.  If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine, wouldn't you like to know? Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong? Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certain things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small?  Any of the things that they might read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet. On the internet, there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects. Your child's curiosity could lead them to inappropriate websites.  When I was a child and I was curious, my parents sheltered me from certain things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in second grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures, and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read. I felt like I couldn't talk to my parents about these things. I mean, what would you do if your second - grader came home from school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus? What if the high schoolers had been lying to me? I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about.  What I'm saying is that we should understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear. But it isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions. Besides, isn't it your fault in all reality if they get their hands on something inappropriate for their age because they aren't getting the proper supervision? If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is inappropriate, ask questions. Explain things to them when they ask you a question. Don't beat around the bush. Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truly is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it. By allowing access to library materials, we can guide our children to make informed decisions.
638	3615	2	3	No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history. Books not only help people advance in their reading skills but also help them discover new things. When I was in middle school, I always liked to read Stephen King and Edgar Allan Poe books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books, they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and violence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different, and all people like different types of books. There are all kinds of books, for example, there are thrilling mystery books, imaginative fiction books, fact - based non - fiction books, and educational historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books, but they're not the books you read for pleasure every day.  I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book. When I was in elementary and through junior high, we had to take reading tests on the computer. In seventh and eighth grade, we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also had a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our English class. It was never a problem for me because I loved to read.  Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example, any book that involves nudity or excessive violence. Now, that's just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Currently, there aren't that many books out there for little kids to read. There are more adult books than little kids' books.  All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will affect them later on in life. If they don't like to read, persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they saw their relatives reading too. Just remember, kids and adults of all ages, reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read. It enriches our minds and broadens our horizons.
639	3616	2	3	In this persuasive essay, I'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelves, and there are a couple of reasons that are going to help me make my point. I think that we shouldn't take anything off the shelves in libraries.  My first main point is that there are some materials that people might find offensive, while others do not. Those who want these materials off the shelves are affecting the access of others. I think that some of the movies and books that are taken off the shelves are materials that some kids might experience and that could help them in the future. For instance, a controversial book might spark critical thinking.  My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelves, there would only be movies and books like Bambi and Scooby - Doo, because all the materials in libraries are offensive to people in some ways, different from person to person. I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found offensive.  Also, if we do remove the so - called offensive materials, we might as well not even have a library, because there would only be about a handful of movies and books in the whole building. This is due to all of the offensive material that people could find in CDs, books, and movies.  People hear cuss words probably every day, whether it's at school or home. So all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them. I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book. Scary movies are not real, and some books too. There is sex and other inappropriate things in movies, but that's also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies.  To summarize what I was just talking about in the last couple of paragraphs, I think that we should not take any thing off the shelves in libraries because it will hurt others' access to diverse materials, and there's just no real need for it. Libraries should be a place of open access and free exploration.
640	3617	2	3	"When I walk into a library to look for a book, I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books, movies, or magazines. When I see that, I think, ""What if a child saw this?"" I would like a library for my child to visit without me worrying about the things they could see. To fix this problem, the libraries could do a number of things.  First off, the libraries could censor what they put out on the shelves. By putting the adult books section near the check - out place, an employee at the library could easily spot any small children wandering into that section. If that solution does not work, then try and rate the sections like we rate movies. Put R - rated books and movies together, PG - 13 books and movies together, PG books and movies together, and so on.  One time, when I took my baby brother to the library, he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out. I was shocked and embarrassed. I did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library, but it did.  I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice. So I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed, but placed in better order so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff. By properly organizing the library, we can ensure that both children and adults can have a positive experience and access the materials they need."
641	3618	2	3	Thoughts of Literature I feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries. If a piece of literature is particularly offensive, such as containing extreme violence, explicit sexual content, or highly discriminatory views; the piece should not be displayed. From my own experience, controversy is often the reason that books are stricken from libraries. All of my experience, observations, and reading have told me one thing. That one thing being, pieces of literature are taken away because of their offensiveness. From the experience that I have had with books that cause controversy, I have noticed myself not liking the book. I believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries. Coming from someone who does not particularly like reading, I feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though I would not like to read any longer. All of my experiences seem to point to not reading books that cause distress or controversy. Of all that I have observed, I have found similar things as my experiences. I have seen people, classmates in particular, that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them. Though my observations sometimes seem one - sided, I truly have observed more lack of reading due to controversy than the increasing of reading due to controversy. All of my observations seem to point to supporting the revocation of 'banned books'. The piece that I have noticed most prominent to this topic that I have read would most definitely be Fahrenheit 451. In said novel, society has outlawed all books. The story seems to heavily favor those who wish to read controversial novels, though we can take something from reading this book. The reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument, as people lived happily without controversial books. Granted not all people did, but that is because of certain variables. From stories, such as the three little pig and the big bad wolf, we can understand how poorly the concept of controversiality is drawn. For instance, I was mortified hearing that the first time. I have never had the interest of hearing it again, as I felt that the story is not politically correct. Pieces of literature are taken away because of their offensive properties. If someone has no interest in reading a book because of the thoughts maintained inside of the text; the book must be stripped from the public. As it would only make sense to try to keep the peace. I for one support the cause to remove books from public places due to controversiality, as it helps create a more harmonious and pleasant reading environment for the majority.
642	3619	2	3	Should the library be censored on the books it has on the shelves? I think it should be. There are many offensive books and things on the shelves, like those with excessive vulgar language, explicit sexual content, or glorification of violence. I wouldn't want my kid or anybody else's kid reading offensive books. So let's get rid of all the bad stuff or at least filter it all. I believe any book, movie, and magazines that have a lot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be checked out to a certain age. If they want to keep the books on the shelves, they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permission slip to get the books. Removing the books and things completely might cause too much trouble, so we should definitely make sure the kid is a certain age and has permission. I would not want my 10 - year - old kid read a book with bad language in it. Kids catch on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. There is a lot going on in society nowadays that badly influences children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are criminals. I think that's why we have so many problems today because everyone sees it at a young age and they want to be like that when they get older, but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. If we do not filter what they do at a young age, they will end up being hell - raisers and out of control because they will think just because someone in a book or movie did it that it's okay for them to do it, but it's not. I would not want a young kid to read bad things. I say let's put an age limit on them and make our society better and our kids become better adults later on in their life. We need to filter out the bad and put new, positive content in for our younger kids. If we don't, who knows how they'll grow up to be. The world could go to hell if we don't stop the kids from learning bad things. So let's get the filtering started and save the world and our kids' future by creating a more suitable and healthy reading environment in libraries.
643	3620	2	3	People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive. The problem with the organization is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people. The truth is that when you have as many people as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes. Libraries are places of knowledge. They keep many different books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library. Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like. So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not. For example, if someone loves science - fiction, they'll quickly pick up a sci - fi book and ignore others that don't interest them. Magazines are like books in a way. People know what they want. With magazines though, people usually just flip through the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skimming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read. Usually after that, they are done with the magazine. For instance, a fashion - loving person will quickly find the latest fashion trends article and then put the magazine aside. Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around. There is something about music that soothes the human body. Music is one of those things that is constantly changing with time. Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced. Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't. There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music. There are people who hate change. Likewise, they don't like to change their favorite music types. But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a few types of music. But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played. Just in the last century, movies have come a long way in advancement. Movies used to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it. But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change. Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on. Directors try to make the best movie possible, so it's almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie. But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive. Movies are supposed to be entertaining, not something people should get offended by. Movies are good about it though. They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads - up, so that the audience knows what to expect in the movie. It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music, or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it. There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing. It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same. So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will. We should respect the diversity of preferences and not let the sensitivities of a few limit the choices of many.
644	3621	2	3	Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? Personally I don't think they should be. If there is something in the book that is remotely offensive towards children, such as inappropriate language or sexual innuendos, then it should be put under a section for adults only. Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group. If there is a book that is racially unacceptable, like one with derogatory racial slurs or discriminatory views, then it should be put in the adult section, not anywhere for children. When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not, they should review all the possibilities of how someone might comprehend the story to see their reaction with it. There are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so there is always a place that the book can go to. Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it. For example, in literature, we just finished reading the book 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. There is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the 'n - word'. It is a very harsh word, but it goes with the setting and the background of the story. When someone is not sure if a book is acceptable or not, they should take into consideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is needed or not. In many cases, the unacceptable thing might work along with the story. If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it, then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is not allowed for one item, then it shouldn't be allowed for something else. It is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it. I have read many books that have certain words that don't bother me, but someone else who isn't used to it might not like. Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate stuff from the type of music they listen to. It all comes down to who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music. Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking the books off of the shelves, then eventually there wouldn't be any books left on the shelves anymore. Just because something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from people's enjoyment. We should use proper categorization and guidance rather than outright removal.
645	3622	2	3	If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' When you asked why you were not allowed, the same answer was always given, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again, they would most likely have said, 'If I wanted you to know, then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it? Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things. How would it change things if those movies, games, or music had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them? What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch 'The Breakfast Club' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive? I would also like for you to think about the child you might have or might plan to have. Would you want your child to be subjected to such things as 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Pulp Fiction' as a 10 - year - old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence? Then they would never see them and to some that might be what's right. And for those of you who think that, I have some news for you. Those kind of movies are still made today. 'A Clockwork Orange' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that I could throw at you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies. There are almost always movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them. You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes. What would there be left to watch? If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, maybe just the Disney and Pixar movies? Not only that, but what movies would you have to watch? If all movies with something offensive in them were removed, then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself. Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see, is gone. My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that might be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see. Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music. It's what I'm sure your parents did to you, and I know it's what
646	3623	2	3	I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people who visit the library aren't seeking material with offensive language and/or themes. They come to the library for a quiet and clean - reading environment. On the other hand, there are individuals who believe that having offensive language when it's integral to the work is better than censoring it. For instance, in a realistic novel about a gritty urban environment, offensive language might be used to accurately depict the setting and characters. Take for example a book about @PERSON1. It could contain elements that some people find offensive. But if someone has to write a detailed report on @PERSON1, having as much un - censored information on him as possible is crucial for a comprehensive understanding. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, the library should provide both a clean and an explicit version of the album. This way, different patrons' preferences can be accommodated. There are ways that censorship can be beneficial, and some ways that it can be detrimental. Some people are genuinely offended by bad language and inappropriate themes, while others see it as a form of artistic freedom for the creator. I think that leaving things in their original, uncensored form, whether good or bad, is better than complete censorship. It allows for a more diverse and open cultural exchange in the library.
647	3624	2	3	A young kid walks into the library in the up - town area. He looks around curiously and spots a movie that one of his close friends recommended he watch. Excitedly, he checks it out and hurries home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to find their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to utter rude comments, behaves violently, and uses profanity. Who is to blame? Is it the friend who recommended the movie without considering its potential impact, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and allowing the young kid to check it out without proper age - verification? Today, many libraries offer a wide variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have dedicated computers for kids, teenagers, and adults. These computers can be used for various purposes such as business tasks, sending personal emails on websites, or kids can play age - appropriate games. But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatening. Libraries have movies that are rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. They @MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the @CAPS5. Some libraries @MONTH1 not meet their requirements, and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others. In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music and @CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and the materials they offer. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose from, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages. In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people but also for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library, and I believe that all the libraries around should strive to meet their requirements to create a safe and suitable environment for all patrons.
648	3625	2	3	Censorship at the library is not needed at all times. It is primarily the parents' responsibility to take away inappropriate books from their kids. It isn't the library's job to dictate what people can or cannot read. There are certain cases when censorship might seem necessary, but generally, the onus lies on parents. It's the parents' role to guide their kids, to tell them what is right and what is wrong. They are the ones raising the children, not the library. Otherwise, the parents are shirking their duties. The libraries have the right to acquire whatever books they want as long as there isn't anything extremely harmful in them. I understand if they remove books, movies, and magazines that are truly offensive, but if there is just one little word in a great work, people should get over it. Isn't that why some people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' to be changed? Because some black people find certain language in them offensive. It's not right. People are trying to rewrite history, to sugar - coat the truth. Well, these books are like a reflection of the real world. In the real world, people aren't always nice. They can be downright mean sometimes. The whole world has its flaws. There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of literature. In real life, people might cuss you out if they feel like it, while in books, the language is often limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because a minority finds it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and cannot read. The library shouldn't censor their books, as it restricts the free flow of knowledge and cultural heritage.
649	3626	2	3	The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books that are frequently censored in school libraries across the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, some people believe they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series, have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive. Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press, and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to express what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right. By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' from being read, the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayal of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However, the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently, that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1. However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves, that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most - censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'. If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel, it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere. Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so, an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works, the children will still find a way to access them, and they should have the right to explore diverse literary works.
650	3627	2	3	I believe that the view on censorship in libraries is fine as it stands for many reasons. The main reasons I believe censorship in libraries is appropriate are that almost everything in the library is there for people to learn from, whether they read a book or watch a movie. Another reason is that if they removed everything that was offensive or disliked, there would be a significantly reduced amount of information for people to learn about in libraries. I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive, then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them, and it would not be feasible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place where someone can go to learn about something. They hold a vast amount of information about many different subjects that people visit to learn about, even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive, they should simply leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it. There are things in life that people need to be exposed to or informed about, even though they @MONTH1 not always be pleasant. Libraries are the place where people get introduced to these things, and if these things are removed, then where will people go to be informed about this information? To sum it all up, yes, there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive, but other people @MONTH1 learn from it, and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should always have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have had a profound impact on their lives and will continue to learn more things as long as libraries remain a source of diverse and open information.
651	3628	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In today's society, there are many kids who are vulnerable and are getting involved in bad things. There are certain things kids just should not be exposed to. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are truly offensive. Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role - model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this popular kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right group of peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is censored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role - model. Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library have the actors doing illegal things in them. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It may be crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a six - year - old kid shooting his father in the head. This kid thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies. Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then their parents will not have to worry too much about them going off and doing bad things because they see their peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life. Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well, I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used. In conclusion, it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.
652	3629	2	3	"People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesn't like something, they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes across as offensive to you, you should not be able to remove it. One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldn't be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone in @MONTH1 will feel the book, movie, magazine, or music is offensive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or anything in the library because they feel it's bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read. Another reason I feel the so - called ""bad"" things shouldn't be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offensive things out of the library. Many people enjoy the offensive things in books, movies, and so forth. I think from my own perspective that I like having a little bit of the ""bad"" in my life, and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magazine is what it takes, I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good without having to worry if it's there or not. In my own opinion, I believe that without offensive remarks or words, there wouldn't be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offensive things seem rude and inappropriate doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny. Although some offensive things in libraries can seem too inappropriate, I believe that if they're there then obviously they're not too bad, and they shouldn't be taken out because one person feels that it's not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has their own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do. In the end, respecting the diverse preferences of library - goers is crucial for a well - functioning library environment."
653	3630	2	3	There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences. By clearly marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them effectively. In our public libraries, all books and movies are placed in one area for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated @CAPS1, the parents would most likely become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 item. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating. In which case, the library would be harassed for not letting the child check it out. Furthermore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child cannot see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inappropriate materials. By simply having their age clearly indicated on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of. Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship policies. It would give them a better reputation, and give our children a more secure place to gain access to these materials. This way, the library can better serve both the children and their parents.
654	3631	2	3	Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible? I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books. In my opinion, it would be beneficial to students, parents, or teachers to get information on different topics. As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they may not be familiar with in @MONTH1, and allowing all the types of books would help anybody with any topic. A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something, find an interesting read, or just relax. If you're going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about, it would be nice to find a comprehensive book telling all about the topic. This would help students with reports, along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic. If a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library, then I think that person should just try and ignore the books. I think this because I don't think books should be taken out that are beneficial to others, just because it is offensive to someone who could just ignore it. Maybe the books are about drugs, sex, or violence, but they still are able to teach many people who aren't already knowledgeable about these inappropriate, or offensive topics. In conclusion, throwing books out and keeping a library overly censored would be a mistake. It is a mistake because it is taking away from many people who are wanting to become knowledgeable about different topics. It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school, or even work. Libraries should strive to be a source of all - encompassing knowledge.
655	3632	2	3	No, because if that is the case, every book you read could be offensive to somebody. If they think the book is bad then don't read it. First off, a book should not be banned from a library. It is just a book. Second, the only reason they would want to ban a book is because some people like to start drama. Third, almost anything could be offensive to somebody. First off, they should not ban a book just because some people don't like it. If your child reads an adult book, it could be good for them as they get to read big words. And if they just happen to see a naked picture, it is not the end of the world. I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last time they encounter such content. Second, some people would try to ban a book just to start drama. They know it will cause a lot of chaos with the author and the library community. Finally, if they ban books for being offensive then they would not have much of a library left. Because almost anything someone says or writes can be considered offensive by someone else. In all, they should not ban a single book. Libraries should be a place where all forms of literature can co - exist, allowing people to make their own choices about what to read.
656	3633	2	3	In libraries, there are indeed certain materials on the shelves that might be offensive to some people. I've witnessed some of these materials with my own eyes. But the question remains: should libraries take them off the shelves because of this? Some might find it offensive, while others might not. It all boils down to the individual. Libraries simply can't please everyone. In my view, libraries should not remove these materials from the shelves. A material that one person wants removed could be a favorite of another. Just because a material stays on the shelf doesn't mean there aren't solutions for those who think it should be removed. Some solutions could be to place these 'offensive materials' on taller shelves or in a separate room. This way, children or those who dislike the idea won't have to see them. Then both 'people who find it offensive' and 'people who don't' get their say, and the problem is solved. If this solution doesn't work, there are plenty more. The library can take out the truly offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all. Overall, I firmly believe libraries should not remove these materials. By trying to make both the offended and non - offended sides happy, we can avoid further disputes.
657	3634	2	3	Yes, I do think that if material in a library is offensive, it should be removed from the library. The library is a place where people go to gain a better understanding of things they're unfamiliar with. Here's my reasoning. If you visit a library and see something you don't like and consider inappropriate for others to see, it should be taken off the shelf. I wouldn't want anyone in a library to be dissatisfied with the books, movies, music, or any other materials, especially when children are involved. People should be able to visit a public place where they're satisfied with how it's managed, and it should be a suitable place for children to come and learn. The library is a learning environment where education, growth, and development should be encouraged. My main point is that a library should prioritize learning. If something in the library is offensive to someone, it should be removed. I firmly believe that children should be able to visit a library and be content with its offerings. By ensuring the library is free of offensive materials, we can create a better learning space for everyone.
658	3635	2	3	Should materials in libraries be censored? No, I don't think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone, that person simply doesn't need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library. If someone doesn't like the materials available, that's their problem. What if kids get inappropriate stuff off the shelf? If a kid were to pick something bad or inappropriate for themselves, the libraries won't let them check it out, so it's not an issue. Additionally, parents should be monitoring what their kids are getting. I visit the library frequently, and I've never seen anything inappropriate. I also don't know anyone who's ever told me they've found something offensive in a library. I think libraries are well - aware of what people want and don't want. It's not right to take something off the shelves just because a few people don't like it, as I'm sure other people enjoy it. However, if there's something extremely offensive that everyone agrees is bad, then it can be removed. But you can't remove material every time someone complains it's offensive, or there probably won't be anything left in the library. In conclusion, I don't think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive. There are likely just as many people who don't find it offensive, and it would be unfair to take it away from them.
659	3636	2	3	I believe that if there's a book in a library that a child isn't allowed to read, the book should be placed where the child can't access it. I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library where a child doesn't have access. Also, the library should have a section where only a certain age group can read those books. In some libraries, there are many books not suitable for children, yet they're placed where children can easily access them, and this shouldn't be allowed. So, I firmly believe children shouldn't have access to those types of books. The same principle applies in a store. In some stores, there's a magazine section with inappropriate content that a child shouldn't see. In the grocery store I go to, there are inappropriate images and words that a child shouldn't read. There should be an area in the store where only a certain age group can access these magazines. One day, I was in the store and saw a little kid reading a magazine, saying the bad words in it and looking at the bad pictures. This is why magazines should be placed where children can't access them. In the same store, there's a music section, and children are often there. The music isn't all bad, but kids can take the CDs off the shelves and take them home to listen. This is partly the parents' fault if they buy the CDs for their children. I think the CDs for little children should be in one part of the store, and the CDs for older people should be in an area where they can access them. The same goes for movies. There are movies in stores rated from various levels, including those for specific age audiences only. Many movies rated for older audiences have content that children shouldn't see. For example, movies for adult audiences often show nudity and other inappropriate content that no one under a certain age should view, yet some of these movies are just sitting on the shelves. So, children shouldn't be able to access these types of movies. The main reason I've explained all this is to prevent children from getting hold of such inappropriate materials. If kids start listening to bad music, they might start using bad words and get in trouble at school or elsewhere. Similarly, if a child reads a book with bad content, they might imitate what they read. In movies, if a child sees inappropriate content, they might show it to their friends or get bad ideas. In conclusion, by restricting children's access to these inappropriate materials, we can protect them from negative influences.
660	3637	2	3	Should we have the right to remove materials from shelves if they're found offensive? I believe we should not have this right. If we did, there would be no materials left for future children to read. When considering this right, we must remember that even though some materials may mention discrimination, use an offensive word, or we simply don't like a book, movie, or magazine, we should never have the right to remove them. I know several people who think a seemingly harmless children's book is discriminatory. There are books that discuss discrimination against certain races or inform us about a time when people were discriminated against. If we had the right to remove these materials, they would all eventually disappear. Future children wouldn't know that these events ever happened, or if they did, their information would likely be inaccurate as people might distort the story over time. If someone found a single offensive word in a book or movie, they could remove it from others' view. For instance, if someone found a curse word offensive and had the right to remove the material, thousands of good books and movies would disappear because of one person's dislike of a word. Some people might think certain materials are a waste of space and remove them if they don't like the book, movie, music, or magazine. However, there are others who enjoy these materials and find them good or entertaining. Judging a book by its size or the size of its words isn't a valid way to evaluate it. I firmly believe that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We should keep these materials as a reference for future generations. In the past, people have destroyed materials they didn't like, and now we'll never know what they were about. There's no reason to remove a material based on one person's opinion. By preserving these materials, we can ensure that future generations have access to a wide range of knowledge and perspectives.
661	3638	2	3	Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.   First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, people have diverse interests. Some people, like me, are fond of certain kinds of books and movies, while others prefer different genres. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This natural difference in preference is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.  I believe that we can solve this problem by just separating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are separated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completely from a library.  All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I firmly believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive as it goes against the principle of catering to diverse interests.
662	3639	2	3	I'm really sick and my head really throbs at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take it easy on me.  Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imagination, taken in whatever direction they so choose for it to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less than lonesome trash floating on the winding streets if it were censored.   It is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way too scary for them, plus it shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch it. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre - read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about it, of course.  The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see it in my children's section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non - explicit ones on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is an unnecessary and unjust practice that undermines the freedom of choice and access to diverse literature.
663	3640	2	3	There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country. Consumers are constantly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying. Some parents may not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying. Some of the material may be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them. But if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem. That is why these materials should remain on the shelves.  One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumers' choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items. People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy. If they do not want to buy or check these materials out then they should just go to another shelf, or shop at another store. I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go to the other extreme. If stores take away these items, it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice.  It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers. The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions. If they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice. These offensive items can not just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them. With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores. No matter what, there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials. On television, there are always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to buy their stuff. I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers. It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers.  If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare. If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a limited selection at the libraries. By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another person's favorite book. People can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language. There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers. From my personal experience, I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books. Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words.  There is a variety of materials available to the public that may be offensive to some, especially to their little children. As a parent, it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown. People can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some. This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kinds of materials. If they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store. It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from shelves is an unjust approach that restricts consumer choice and fails to address the real issue of parental responsibility.
664	3641	2	3	I believe that if you are at a library or movie store, or wherever and there are books, movies, magazines, or CDs that you think are offensive, then they should most likely be taken off of the shelf.  Have you ever walked into a store and seen something not appropriate for little kids, and you feel a bit embarrassed yourself? I know I have at least at one point in my life. Which is why I believe that it should be removed from the store, or at least the shelves.  I always try to think of how my grandparents would feel if they knew what kind of music most teens are listening to today. There is so much terrible language and talking about violence and bad things that really just isn't appropriate for anyone to hear, or even talk about.  Some people feel different about this, and some people take it a little too seriously, but you have to remember everyone has their own opinion. In conclusion, while respecting different opinions, we should still take steps to ensure that offensive materials are not easily accessible, especially in public places like libraries and stores.
665	3642	2	3	Dear Assignment paper, I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well. For example, I believe that certain books should be removed from the library shelves because, under - age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displayed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that it's a library, and libraries have different types of books.  First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because it's a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under - age children as well. I know that certain books under - age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprived of their privileges of staying in the library reading such books.  Next, I do not agree that certain books should be viewed on library shelves because other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reason I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people's race, and if, for say, a black, Mexican, maybe even an Arabian person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.  However, I do not think that any book should be deprived from a library. My reason for thinking that is simply because it's a library, and libraries are developed for many people with different types of interests in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropriate for certain people's interests in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.  Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book because it lacks interest in someone or offends someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people's point of view. In conclusion, the decision to remove books from libraries is a complex one that requires a balanced consideration of different perspectives and the overall purpose of a library as a place for diverse knowledge and interests.
666	3643	2	3	When you go to different places, there will always be something that one won't like because not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people facing things they don't like. Censorship in libraries is getting worse and worse every day. It is present in everything - in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on the shelves? Everyone who reads this will think differently about censorship in libraries. On the shelves, there are lots of things with bad language and naughty pictures. These books can be easily pulled off the shelf by little kids, and they might see things that their parents don't want them to see. Censorship is everywhere, not just in libraries. The books and other items in the libraries need to be changed and not be so inappropriate. If there is a need for such things, then there should be a special store for them. In conclusion, a proper solution needs to be found to address the issue of inappropriate content in libraries and the over - reaching censorship.
667	3644	2	3	Censorship in libraries is quite a big deal in schools. There might be a book that someone really wants to read, but they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of great educational books have been taken off the shelves of libraries because they are either too violent or they have bad language in them. If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they simply do not need to check them out. There should not be censorship on books in schools. There have been numerous books that teachers view as being educational and would like to give to their class to read, yet they have been taken off the library shelves. There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad words or a few violent scenes to read. Some of the banned books could relate to someone and touch their hearts. Banning books in libraries needs to change. People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are many excellent books that have been banned. 'To Kill for Scout' for example was banned in public schools for some unclear reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and I could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of restriction should be open to everybody regardless of age. Censorship in libraries is something that needs to be eliminated for good. Many people's lives could be changed, touched, or moved due to a book. Many of the banned books are great and can have a profound effect on someone's life. People should be able to read what they want, when and where they want. In conclusion, the current state of library censorship in schools is unjust and needs to be rectified to allow free access to a wide range of literature.
668	3645	2	3	I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word 'offensive' clearly indicates something inappropriate. Or those things should be placed where not everybody can access them, like keeping them away from little kids or when a particular religion doesn't accept such content. For example, in my opinion, there are some books, music, movies, or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, not just to me but to many other people as well. Offensive, for me, is when there are inappropriate things such as certain images, videos, or bad words that should not be heard or seen by everyone. You have to be cautious when you consider something offensive because not everyone thinks like you. Everybody has a different opinion and conclusion, and we must remember that we have the power to talk, read, and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music. I'm just saying that there is a proper time for everything. We are young and are looking forward to a good future, not just for ourselves but also for the younger kids. The older people have to provide us with the best they can because they have experience and know what is best for their kids. This is a free country, and people should express their opinions and make them count. If you think something is bad, say it. It's important to remember not to let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive to someone else. In conclusion, a balanced approach should be taken to handle offensive materials while respecting individual freedoms and diverse opinions.
669	3646	2	3	In today's world, there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take all offensive materials away, we would be removing most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed significantly from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we take action? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can reduce the amount of inappropriate materials that children take home. If you were to walk into any store these days, you would surely find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing their best to separate these inappropriate materials from the family - oriented ones. However, sometimes it is just not enough. Children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and then these other children start following suit. Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking should not be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also realize that it is not good for children to learn and listen to these things and should keep their children away from them as much as possible. Like the author said, if everyone was able to take something off the shelves, there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to reduce the amount. The materials we cannot eliminate, we can keep on the shelves and other places but just in areas where children don't go. I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from R - rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about, then it does not bode well for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from being exposed to these negative things in life. Keeping the children away from these materials will make the world a better place. In conclusion, it is our collective responsibility to protect children from harmful materials for a brighter future.
670	3647	2	3	There are numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. However, I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive, and they should not be taken off the shelves just because a few people do not agree with them. First, people have diverse views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or songs to be removed. Due to people always having different views, it is extremely difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves to satisfy everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in a movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive, I would not want it taken off the shelves completely. Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelves, there would not be many left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' She is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves, there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive, and if everyone took these things off the shelves, there would be none left for anyone. Finally, if someone finds a book offensive, they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive, they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves, the person could simply avoid it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive, and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive, they could just steer clear of it instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offended by one of my favorite books, I would prefer if they just avoid reading it instead of taking it off the shelves so that I can't read it. Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive and would like them to be removed permanently. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. While taking these off the shelves might make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive, and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them. In conclusion, a more inclusive approach should be adopted to deal with offensive materials in libraries and other media sources.
671	3648	2	3	Everyone has things that would offend them, whether they admit it or not. Books are well - known to have this effect on people. However, there are all different kinds of books, music, and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of individuals. There are even books read in school classrooms that end up offending some people. Reading is an important activity, and whether or not the reader likes it, they will inevitably come across a book that offends them. I firmly believe we have the right to have those offending things because there are so many books that offend people, music and movies have censorship options, and if people don't like it, they should simply ignore it.  First of all, we have the right to have these kinds of books. Just like in life, there are certain things people don't like, but they deal with them anyway. That's exactly what this situation is about. Even though there are a handful of people out there who don't like those certain books, those very books are often the ones that are well - liked and become famous. I have personally read a book that people have wanted to ban, and it was one of the best books I have ever read. To sum it all up, if we took away every book that one person didn't like, there would be only a few left.  Secondly, music and movies have censorship. You can choose whether you want that censorship or not. Movies clearly tell what ages are appropriate to watch those movies. Music platforms block out the words that need to be censored. If people don't want the uncensored content, they don't have to listen to it or watch it. We all have the certain things we love and hate, and we simply can't eliminate all of the hated things.  Last of all, in my opinion, if people don't want it, they don't have to have it. The music and movies are an option for people. They don't have to listen or watch something they think is a bad idea. It's all opinion - based; there isn't a right or wrong to it. I know of people out there who don't have cable TV or they don't listen to the radio, and that's perfectly fine. They don't have to complain about it because they don't pay any attention to it.  To wrap this all up, there are so many books out in the world that offend people, the music and movies have censorship, and if people can't stand it, they don't have to deal with it. As I said, these books, magazines, music, etc. are very well - liked by many people, so why get rid of them for those few who get offended? We all have things we do and don't like that we cannot do anything about. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
672	3649	2	3	There I was, slowly shuffling my way through the library, carefully searching for the perfect books to check out. It was then that I had unexpectedly stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting. The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face, and the back included a summary of a book I immediately wanted to get my hands on. The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it. Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, and it is then our job to discover them. Whether literature includes stories of love and heartbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.  Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone else's. Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas. Should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides? Literature is an escape for many people. It is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading. If we remove books that might be offensive to one person, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries is sheltering our world.  Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives. We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like. Instead, we should allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music. If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listens to it or not. The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.  In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries. Instead, it should be regulated through our parents or elders. The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective. If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public.
673	3650	2	3	The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already. A few reasons explain why the censorship is alright as it is. Those reasons are that the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.  The first reason is that parents should be in charge of what their children read. If the parents would just clearly tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it. If the parent does not want their child to go into a particular section, then the parents can simply say, 'Keep away from that area.' Although, sometimes the child might stray away from its parents, it is not very likely that the parent will not notice. That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.  The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship. Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious books (such as nudity, swears, etc.) are extremely inappropriate. Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are inappropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are a part of past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever. Most children will look at these books and think that the books are too big to read, so they would not even look at them. Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.  The third reason is that libraries have different subjects other than the inappropriate books. The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others. It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say, '@CAPS2 I want to read that one.' The child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort. The point being that a person can read other books than just inappropriate books.  Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people; others would disagree. The children probably would not look at the inappropriate book anyway because it would not interest the child.
674	3651	2	3	So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books through a library. She frowns and chucks @CAPS4. You look at her, she looks at you, and then she walks away. You go and pick up the book, and @CAPS4 turns out to be about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say. If @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf.  I'm trying to convince librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes. One, it's @CAPS1, it's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if you're walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and use the facilities and then leave.  What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you're just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town. One library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf. You're never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 online. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library.  But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelves. Say you got a @NUM2 - year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex - love book. What can you say about that? I mean it sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless environment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad.  After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians of how they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault. Different people like different books, that's why a library has many, many choices when it comes to books.  That's when the question comes up, 'Why don't we just have separate rooms for separate books?' Sure, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for it? Libraries get donated a lot of their stuff. They are profitable in some ways, but then again they are a non - profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages. Most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that. That's when they start making decisions about seperate rooms.  It sounds crazy, but it wouldn't cause a riot among people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians are happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for it, check it out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. It sounds easier than looking it up, getting the dewy decimal number, and finding the number.  All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf because it might be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, 'It's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.'
675	3652	2	3	Imagine walking out of your home, and right down the street, you see a giant bonfire blazing right in the open. You notice men walking into a library empty - handed and then walking out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media. The men then casually toss them into the raging inferno, and you watch as they become incinerated, lost forever. This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people.  Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple. In the @ORGANIZATION1, it clearly states that there will be freedom of the press. By tossing out certain literary works, this right will be thrown to the side. And by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble? As citizens of the @LOCATION1, we cannot let this happen to our great nation.  By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically. For example, take @PERSON1's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @CAPS1 faith. If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost, and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information. If this were to take place, our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and an expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge.  Picture @CAPS2 in the @DATE1. Hitler's @ORGANIZATION2 has taken power and is systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the @ORGANIZATION2 cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries. This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place. The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people, which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those of the select few.  In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the
676	3653	2	3	Maybe, to a certain sense, I do not think that books should be removed to a large extent. The reason for this is that some books, magazines, and other printed materials can be highly informative. They can offer valuable insights and help you with certain complex questions. They may not always precisely answer what you need, but they are there to look back at and understand what type of generation we have.  But, there are also other reasons. Some things can be offensive to others. People may take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting emotionally hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to cause damage to others and can hurt other people's feelings. The proper sense of this nature is to ask the store to remove the books or magazines. The store cannot take the books off the shelf if only one person is offended by the book.  If you take every offensive book off the shelf, then you will not learn from the mistakes it has shown in other people's lives. They may think it would be a good idea to take books off the shelf, but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to teach. They may think they are doing the right thing by not showing you sexual offensive stuff. You may not want kids or others to see this sexuality and understand what the world is becoming.  Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They may not like what they see, but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness - related content some people have. Certain books should stay on the shelf, such as a medical book. Medical books show the human body; they do not hide the human body, and we should know about the human body. So the medical books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provocative stuff, then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexual side of human beings.  The medical magazines are there to learn, not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others, then that means you would have to take off the medical items. People could get offended by not looking like the people in the magazine. That could offend them, so would you take it off the shelf or not? No, you would not because a medical book is there for your learning environment, not to offend you. That also could go for the sexual magazines. Yes, sex is good for you, but would you want to teach that to younger kids that fast? You would want to teach them about sexual intercourse properly, not through a magazine. I know that medical books and tapes can be encouraging sex - related discussions, but they are mainly talking to adults.  As far as music and tapes go, no, I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment, and people like to relax to this sort of stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of certain artists' or music, but other people do. They enjoy it. If you did take it off, then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy, not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places, they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is for listening. Sure, some music is horrible, but what music isn't these days.  If music is what you are interested in, then why would we take it off the shelves? People make a living listening to music and creating it for others. It is a wonderful thing; it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the drain because it hurt others.  If you go back to the 1960s, there music was about drugs as well, and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it, but it's because they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual music. We are teenagers, and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listening to a Beatles song that would not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The Beatles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.  Generations change, and so does the environment, but you can not change the way we grew up. You can try to make it better, but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough, and they won't let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up with away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music, so why would you take away ours.  It's not something you want to take away; it's something you want to look back and see how much our generations have changed from one to another.
677	3654	2	3	In my opinion, I firmly believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section, they simply don't have to read it. It's not just about certain types of genres, themes, or magazines. Everyone is different, meaning they have different personalities and views on what they like. I think libraries should actually expand their variety of books to better meet the diverse needs of readers.  Libraries that don't cater to a person's desires or interests - what would make them want to stay? Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone. Just like how they have an adult and children section, everyone has a place where they feel like they belong. Even if some people get offended, a person can get offended anywhere, not just by a certain magazine or some music style.  I do believe there should be a certain line of respect, of course. Nothing should get too out of line where it becomes an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic. You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line. Each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner.  In the times that I've been to the library, there may be some things that I don't agree with, like how certain things are presented in a certain way. But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library. I know when I go, I always find my style of music that appeals to me. It's not just the same thing everywhere I go. There are always choices, different options, and more things I can learn about.  Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc., is a way to appeal to everyone. A person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like. There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for, but others might. If everyone told what they like and don't like about a certain book, where's the variety? What books will be left? Everyone has their own thoughts on what they like. If there's a topic you don't like, you probably know least about it. And the library is a good way to search and find information about anything. In conclusion, a diverse library collection enriches the learning experience for all and respects individual preferences.
678	3655	2	3	This essay is all about whether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some.  I do not believe things should be removed from shelves in libraries if they offend someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean it's offensive to all. If you are offended by something they display, there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it. You can also ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need, or try to search what you're looking for on the internet.  When I visit the library, I already know what I'm going to get, so I have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me, I would complain, and if they didn't do anything about it, I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs.  The libraries I go to always have sections separating the different age groups. The sections are split into children, teens, and adults. I've been to the library numerous times, and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offend me, I wouldn't know. Every time I go, I stay in one particular section for teens and look at magazines and books.  I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves, they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't. In the end, libraries should maintain a wide - ranging collection to serve different patrons, and individual responsibility in avoiding offensive content is key.
679	3656	2	3	I think we should not take it off the shelf because what may be offensive to you may not be offensive to me, or it may be something that I think is fun or beneficial to me. And what may be offensive to me may not be offensive to you. And I think if something is offensive to someone, they should just walk off, or just don't mind it. After all, everyone has a different perspective, and we should respect the diversity of opinions when it comes to what is considered offensive or not.
680	3657	2	3	I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone may dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.  The possibility that children will see the offensive material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the children's books. At my local library, there is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books, you must have a parent's permission or be 18 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.  Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. For example, a classic novel may have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written 100 years ago because it has something offensive in it by today's standards.  While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.  Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed. In conclusion, the existing system strikes a reasonable balance between freedom of access and protection from harmful or highly offensive materials.
681	3658	2	3	Have you ever been at the library and asked yourself any of the following thought - provoking questions? Who actually reads this particular book? Why is this specific item here on the library shelf? Are kids really reading or watching this kind of stuff? Do kids frequently check these materials out? Or have you ever wondered or said to yourself any of these strong - worded statements? I definitely don't want my kids to pick this up and read this inappropriate content. This is so extremely offensive. This goes completely against all our family morals. I don't know what kind of strange freak convention this seems to be, but I'm surely no part of it. Let's quickly get out of here. This place is just so wacky. Ever consider what exact books get banned from the library? Who has the power to ban the books?   I think things should have to be very highly offensive to pull them off the shelves. I think that they should just neatly stick them to a side of the library and clearly put an age restriction on it, meaning you have to be a certain age to check out those books. I don't think the books with cussing are that offensively bad. When the person (No matter who it is) goes out into the real world, they are going to inevitably learn and hear curse words. People use them as casually as they do the common words 'and' or 'the'. They are going to hear them until their very grave. Whether they choose to use them or not, that's entirely their personal choice.   For them to be banned or moved to a different group of books, they should have to be sexist, racist, have a large amount of explicit sex, or just be really gruesome. I think they should be placed upstairs with the mushy romance and wacky western books. I mean people could go up there and check them out, but that is the designated adult library area. The staircase should be conveniently located by the circulation desk. When the librarians are not busy, they should go upstairs and check to see if there are any young children up there.   I think the top level or a specific certain area should be the adult area. They have mushy lovey - dovey stuff, they have cowboy shoot - off stuff, and the offensive stuff. The stuff with too much sex, really racist, or really sexist, or gruesome stuff like people killing people for fun. Also, they should have the adult magazines up there too. Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. You know how you go down an aisle at the @CAPS1 market and there are girls in their bikinis and half - naked. Then there are the Cosmopolitan - type magazines. Both should be upstairs. I mean they talk about how to give pleasurable sex. I would hate for some little @NUM1 year old or @NUM2 year old to pick that thing up; she would be scarred for life.   Then the main level or area should be for teen books. You know vampire books, @CAPS1 heroes, crazy fiction stuff, and then the magazines and movies that aren't bad. Then the bottom level should be the children's level, filled with games, puppets, movies, and easy - to - read books. That about sums that up.   I don't think just anybody should be able to ban a book. I think it should be an open process but not just for anyone. There should be a huge, well - organized meeting. With the mayor, a couple of teachers, one English teacher from each educational level, and parents, and the librarians. The person who wants a book banned should have to clearly tell everyone why and provide detailed reasons. Like Author Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.'   In conclusion, a balanced approach is needed in handling library materials. While everyone's concerns matter, a hasty ban of books can lead to a loss of valuable resources and limit the freedom of reading. A proper system of age - appropriate access and a democratic decision - making process for bans can ensure that the library remains a place of learning and exploration for all.
682	3659	2	3	Censorship in the libraries. Do you think that we should be able to take movies, magazines, and books off the shelf? There are many different, often heated arguments about this subject.   I believe if they put the books, movies, and other materials on the shelf, then it should be able to be read and accessed by children and others. They need to learn about everything that's out there in this big, wide world. Because if they don't learn about this now, then they will never know about all of this when they get older. I think that it is critically important for our youth to know about it.   Some people @MONTH1 say that we are too young to be looking at that kind of stuff, but the younger you find out about it, the better off you will be when you get older. You see, having early exposure can help build a better understanding and resilience.   So that is my input on the situation. The younger you are, the more receptive you are to learning, and you can learn more about the diverse stuff that exists. By having access to a wide range of materials, children can develop a broader perspective and be better prepared for the real world. In conclusion, libraries should serve as a source of all - round knowledge, and restricting access to materials based on unfounded concerns about age is not the right approach.
683	3660	2	3	I think that certain materials should not be removed just because a couple of people do not like what is in a book, or movie, or in music. If we were to listen to what everyone said and remove the books that they do not like, then other people would not have anything interesting to read. For example, if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it. A person who @MONTH1 comes in the library daily @MONTH1 wants to read that book because that is the type of books that the man enjoys. Maybe this person is interested in crime - related studies or just likes the genre.   Another example is if a person has children that come into the library and their children were watching movies about gangs, drugs, and violence. The mother would want that movie removed from the library. I say that if the mother does not want her children to watch the movies they do, she should say something to them firmly and punish them every time they are caught watching it. Instead of parents trying to remove the books that many other people like, they should be more disciplined with their children. A way for the library to stop children from getting movies or books they should not be reading is to put all the books and movies in a special area where it will be closely watched. Many people like movies with drugs, and violence. There type of movies or books should not be removed because of what another person thinks about that certain thing.   I also think that if a person does not like the type of language or images in a book or movie, then they should simply not read it or watch it. And if they say their children watch it or read it without their permission, then that is their fault. They should know more about what their young children are doing instead of trying to get that book, movie removed. Sometimes books and movies have very offensive language, but that is because they are just trying to show some of the harsh realities that happen in the real world. They want the movie or book to be as real as possible.   In conclusion, a one - size - fits - all approach to removing materials from the library based on individual sensitivities is not fair. Libraries should be a place that caters to a wide range of interests, and parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's media consumption rather than seeking to limit others' access.
684	3661	2	3	Censorship; the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye. Is this the right thing to do? Should society as a whole take away variety? Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have? I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or inappropriate for certain ages can be controlled.   Movie theatres, video stores, @ORGANIZATION1, and television all do it. They use ratings and age control for their viewers. Now control can be difficult, and @MONTH1 not always work if not handled correctly. To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaurants or bars use; such as, checking identification before letting a book that is '@CAPS1' rated or above be checked out. Different sections in the library can be clearly marked and available to certain age groups. Now you @MONTH1 be thinking; doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us? Well you @MONTH1 be right, but you would rather have our children see violence and other inappropriate materials that they shouldn't? It would be just like the movie theatre. You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomenal compared to what it is. Would you want your six - year - old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a @CAPS2 with cursing in it? Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon?   I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age - appropriate. Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that? Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers for their library are students. This being said, why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material?   Yes, media is everywhere. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should. Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay? Does it make it right for children to see and want all they want to? No, it does not. Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire. Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropriate material? Would you like to set your children up to fail? I know I wouldn't, so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with? I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sakes. With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library is under - regulated, and that needs to be handled and controlled.   In conclusion, while complete censorship is not the answer, implementing proper age - based controls in libraries can strike a balance between freedom of access and protecting the well - being of young readers. This way, the library can continue to be a valuable source of knowledge while ensuring that the content is suitable for different age groups.
685	3662	2	3	Everyone has a favorite book. And some of us can't put it down once we read the first captivating sentence. Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it. Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see? We're all trying to accommodate to everyone and their needs just to avoid a big scene. A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive! Take it down! Disgusting!'. But why?   Everyone has a right to read what they want to read. No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate. Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not? Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the unique ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel. That excuse is completely ridiculous. A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the '@CAPS1 child will become a rebel if they read this!' excuse, then they're not confident in their child's capability, or the fact that they taught their child well.   Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author. How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two painstakingly on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library? Probably extremely angry or deeply upset. Authors have the right to write whatever they want. If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it. If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do? Go right ahead. No one can stop great books from being made, and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it. If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that.   Parents like to protect their children from harm's way and bring them up as fine citizens of @LOCATION1. By having this strong desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'. This is just utterly ridiculous. Controlling a child's life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older. Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch. Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem.   Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today? No one knows. Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themselves as well. Movies are almost just as harmless; limits are needed, but overall? There should be no major problem. Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion. Allowing that
686	3663	2	3	I don't think there should be any censorship. Good books and music shouldn't be removed just because one person finds it offensive. Because the opinions of one person can be different from another. I believe music is censored the most because not many people get offended by books, but censorship in music, I think, is destroying it. Because it's an artist's way of expression, and if people don't want to listen to what they're saying, then they should just not listen to it. Books, I think, shouldn't be taken offensively for the same reason music shouldn't. It's a writer's opinion and expression. It's like telling someone they can't voice their opinion on anything, like racism or use curse words if they want. In a free society, we should respect different forms of expression and not let the sensitivities of a few limit the creativity and freedom of many.
687	3664	2	3	To [Recipient's Name]: I am writing to you today concerning censorship in libraries. I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some people seem offensive and to others not at all. However, I do have my own viewpoint on the situation, and I feel that it is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do. With the world the way it is now, violence can erupt from the simplest of things. Putting books on public shelves for the public to read can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions. Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result. My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books. This will create a safe and happy environment for all who visit public libraries and other public places. It will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents' behaviors. Children follow in their parents' footsteps. Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this position. When our children grow up, we want them to behave in a responsible way. Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior. By taking this step, we can contribute to a more harmonious and respectful community.
688	3665	2	3	Removal of Books: If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken off shelves? No, even though people may find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves. When I was in the sixth grade, my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A [Book Title]'. I searched the whole library for the book, then finally decided to ask for help. The privilege to read the book had been taken away. The book was no longer allowed in elementary schools due to the fact that parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, it was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked, I had to go to a public library and get the book. If you find a book offensive, keep your opinion to yourself and don't read the book. They shouldn't be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not; others may like them. I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want. Books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taken away, then very few books will be read. But the more books read and understood, the more books will be written and published. The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, etc. They all are made for a reason and should be checked out. It is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reviewing, etc., even the things people may find offensive. They may teach lessons. We should embrace the diversity of ideas in literature and other forms of media.
689	3666	2	3	Going to the library, you would think of it as a family environment, wouldn't you? I know that when I think of the library, I do not think of offensive material that would make anyone upset. Surprisingly, many of the libraries do have such material, and I do not think that they should be allowed to, since it is not aimed just for adults. Children love to go to the library to check out books and many other things that they enjoy. But a five - year - old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter, discriminating against the other gender or another race. These materials should not be able to sit upon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down. The writers or the library owners wouldn't let their own children read it, so why should it be okay for someone else's child to read or watch it. I'm not the only one who thinks this. I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appreciate their loved ones finding these things and reading them. The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life. Who knows what they will do or think when they are old enough. These places are supposed to be a family place where you can go to get information, not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racism, and any other derogatory subjects. Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading these corrupted materials; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account. I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches, not only because small children could see them, but adults do not need to be reading, listening, or watching these things either. If you would not want your child to be exposed to such content, why would anyone else want their child to? By creating a clean and positive library environment, we can better nurture the minds of all visitors.
690	3667	2	3	Why should they take them off the shelves? If you ask me, I think they should leave [Content] up there. I think they should leave [Content] up there. Not only is [Content] happening in the libraries, it's happening on televisions also. Everything in the library might not offend some people. Some people take [Content] offensive when they see something that's against their religion, culture, or maybe their country. But we have the people that take certain things in the library offensive but don't worry about [Content]. I say, 'If you check out the library and find something that you take offensive, don't get [Content] just because you don't like [Content] doesn't mean other people won't like [Content]. So why waste time trying to fight to get [Content] off the shelves when [Content]'s really you, the only person worried about [Content]?' It just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them. Like someone said, a pastor was on TV, talking about how bad hell really is since some people don't think [Content]'s not going to be all that bad. He was on TV at the time, and this lady got offensive about [Content] and had them take him off TV. But she didn't have to watch him on TV; she could have watched something else. Nobody made her watch [Content]; she chose to watch [Content]. So what I'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Consider that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use [Content] rather than thinking about just you. In a democratic and diverse society, we should respect the different preferences and freedoms of others.
691	3668	2	3	Libraries are great for multiple reasons. A well - stocked library is the ideal place to go if you need to conduct in - depth research, meet with a tutor to clarify complex concepts, find an interesting book to get lost in during your leisure time, discover that one song you've been searching for among its media collection, or pick out a new movie to rent for a cozy night at home. However, within a library, there are limitations to what they offer and what you can access. Censorship in libraries is a topic that surfaces every now and then, and people will engage in debates over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing. Personally, I think that censorship can just be more inconvenient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade, I was assigned to do a comprehensive research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's. However, this topic turned out to be a real challenge to research because the libraries I visited did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's as it is seen as an 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn't let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren't going to let me proceed smoothly with my research. I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themselves to avoid it. Rather than just getting rid of it all together. The same goes for any form of media. If there is a @CAPS1.V. show that you don't like, don't watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don't listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is @CAPS2.K. and not @CAPS2.K. for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidelines, are set and the child understands what they are. In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information. Any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries shouldn't have to feel responsible for censoring items that might be offensive. It is their job to just offer information.
692	3669	2	3	I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of libraries. Katherine is correct in many ways. If everyone removed the books they disliked, we would not have any books left. The world would lose a great deal of information on important aspects of our lives. I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored. I don't think books should be removed if they are offensive to some people because, sometimes, they help people see the errors in their ways. For example, a book about glorifying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women. Nowadays, people would read that book, and if they were racist, they might not be after reading it because they see how wrong such behavior is. Music is a form of freedom of speech. Some artists see themselves as 'liberators', 'idols', and even 'love - spreaders'. Yes, there are some songs that could 'seem' offensive, but you'll never know how great an artist will become if you cut them down. In the case of the song titled '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6, it has Catholic churches furious because they automatically assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality, she's speaking in a whole different tone. People learn special, powerful life lessons from things or situations that are shunned by our society, and this might always remain the case. We don't know for sure. But one thing we do know is that we can change what we do in the present and better what we're going to do in the future. In conclusion, censoring books and music limits our learning and growth, and we should embrace the diverse information they offer.
693	3670	2	3	Libraries are places where you can get a book that you should be eager to read. As a person, you have every right to access the book you want. I believe that there should not be any way to stop people from reading. So, I believe that the authorities should stop preventing us from taking the books off the shelf. Libraries are meant to be a source of knowledge and entertainment, and everyone should be able to freely explore the vast collection of books they hold. Whether it's a classic novel, a scientific research book, or a light - hearted comic, people should have the liberty to choose according to their interests. Censoring books in libraries goes against the very essence of what a library stands for. In conclusion, libraries should provide unrestricted access to books so that people can expand their knowledge and imagination.
694	3671	2	3	Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No, because all you have to do is simply ignore it or not pay any attention to it, and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting, like an event that happened on the news lately and was published in newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, which has been on the news for the past week. Many people think that it is great that he was finally found and killed. If people find that offensive, it might be because they don't know what he did or weren't around when it happened. If they took down stuff that was offensive, then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone finds a movie that is racist, don't get it. Just put it back on the shelf and find something else, like a heart - warming romance or a side - splitting comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once in a while. For music, if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good. If not, then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend, then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else. Magazines, from what I know, don't really have anything offensive in them. The only things they have are some pictures, juicy gossip, interesting facts, and some stories that might pique your interest. Books might have some things that you find offensive, but if you like the book so much, you might as well finish it. If you find a book that you really like, then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what it is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive. They were all good books, books that I would probably read again if I had the time, but I won't, because I'm a bit lazy. Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or Mexicans, something like that. Well, I haven't read any like that yet, but I have heard some things about it. In the newspapers, there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything else in the newspapers. I think that if you find something offensive, then just ignore it and move on to something else instead of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do any good at all. In conclusion, we should learn to tolerate and selectively engage with media, rather than demanding the removal of potentially offensive content.
695	3672	2	3	"There are so many things these days that people find offensive, in so many different places such as magazines, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet, and even some words in songs. Some people find it so offensive that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials from the shelves. A big concern for parents in this situation is, ""What if my child gets ahold of this? I don't want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood?"" Honestly, parents, if you don't want your young child to read these things or see these pictures, then why take them to these places where such content is available? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that it's something they should not be associated with. Also, if everyone took things off the shelves that they found inappropriate, then we wouldn't have anything left to read, listen to, or watch. A lot of times, one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person greatly. For example, @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same thing extremely offensive. It would lead to many arguments among our communities. Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well and would not be a good idea. If this were to happen, then kids would grow up thinking that this is an easy world. This world is harsh and not easy all the time. Kids learn a lot about this through the media. As long as we have positive role models to explain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed? If people were able to do this, then the communities would have a lot more crime stemming from anger, we would have nothing left to read, watch, or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to expect from the media. So now I ask you, what do you think? In conclusion, rather than removing potentially offensive content, we should focus on education and guidance to help people deal with such material appropriately."
696	3673	2	3	At my point of view, I think if materials such as books are offensive to the reader, the reader should just leave the book alone. Because other readers might just want to read it. The same thing applies to music, movies, magazines, or anything else. Just because you find something offensive, it won't be right to take it away from thousands of other people. Also, I think if something is offensive to more than one person, it shouldn't just be taken away right then and there. We as people should step up and have a vote or talk about the problem. I think it just won't be right for us or to the rest of the world. Then look at how much work the author had to put in. I've never written a book, but I also know it's not easy to do. Here's an example: me and my family wanted to go out to eat, but we didn't know where to eat at. So everybody was thinking about pizza, but my big brother didn't want to. So we didn't go out to eat that night because of one person who didn't want to. That's not fair, now is it? So in my conclusion, I don't think it would be right to take something away because somebody found it offensive. You just got to look at the rest of the world. You just got to because it won't be right to the rest of us.
697	3674	2	3	The content of a library should be full of various materials even if one person finds certain materials offensive. Just because someone thinks a material is offensive, does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgetting it altogether? Some subjects can be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ignore them. One subject that can be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases. You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about. But when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases, they just walk on by, too uncomfortable to be seen in the area. It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware of, even if you think it doesn't affect you. Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history. Some history can be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forget about them. The Holocaust, for example. That was a very dark period in history. Over six million people died because just one person didn't like what they believed in. It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is. We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening. People's likes in music vary. There are so many different types and styles of music. Some music can be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library? The library should always have a large variety of different music. Often people would like to widen their music intellect, and the library is the perfect place to do that. Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing. Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information. If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library, they would most likely find another way to get that information. Having a variety in books, music, movies, and magazines makes what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.
698	3675	2	3	You're watching a movie on TV that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie, and just as it gets close to the best part, the TV skips over that part because people think that that scene is inappropriate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strict when it comes to movies, music, and books. Some of the movies that are popular will end up on TV for the viewers' entertainment. However, some movies have scenes that are a little inappropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the TV companies will cut that scene out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The TV companies even censor historical movies. If it's a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story. Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out, which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music. Books tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many children read books anymore, so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want because reading helps the mind. Some schools ban books because of inappropriate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned. A lot of things seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so strict when it comes to movies, music, and books.
699	3676	2	3	"The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library can be considered inappropriate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This can include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow. At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper can include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student can write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults can say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it can include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose. My freshman year we read ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Macbeth"". We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real - life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scenes and see the movie for what it really was. If this movie was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it. Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age - related material. Many books in this section can include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and can even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives. If libraries start censoring books, we can end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains."
700	3677	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries, some of which are inappropriate and some that are not. But libraries are for learning about many things such as reading for fun, reading the newsletter, or just looking for random information. Libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments, or about animals or anything else. We need all books because they teach us about the past, they all have a purpose, and we become more intelligent. I believe that all books in a library have a purpose. They can be offensive, but they teach us many things. For example, there are books out there that talk about the Holocaust. For some people, this can be a touchy subject, and some might take it offensively. But if we didn't have those books to learn from, we would make the same mistakes as we did back then. Books can teach us so much about the past. We can learn so many things from books than anywhere else in the world. I also think that all books have a purpose to them, whether they are fiction or non - fiction. You might ask 'how do fiction books have purpose?' Well, fiction books have a purpose because they teach us to really use our imagination. Quite a bit of books make us realize that the struggles of a character can be the same struggles of someone in real life. And the most important reason is because fiction books not only catch our attention, but they also catch our children's attention. Fiction books are the first books children know how to read. This is where they start their reading skills. My last reason for why I don't think 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from shelves is because all books make us more intelligent. We learn so much information from all sorts of books. Another example would be that medical books could be 'offensive' as well, but if we didn't have them, we would not have intelligent doctors. My final reason why I disagree with books being removed if they aren't suited for everyone is that someone that wants to learn something wouldn't be able to because what they want to learn could be offensive to others. What I mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think it's offensive. Every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not. But why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc from shelves? Just because we don't like it doesn't mean we have to remove it. Everyone has different taste. We won't ever agree on anything. But removing books from shelves isn't fair to anyone. Yes, they can be unsuited for others, but when we don't like something, don't we just move along to something we do like? Yes we do, so we should do the same thing with books.
701	3678	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Here are the reasons why I hold this view. First, I think if you are reading, listening, or watching any of these things, then simply skip the part that is offensive to you. If you believe that it is offensive to you, then the question is why you are even engaging with it in the first place. If you find it offensive, just put it down and forget about it. You don't have to read or watch it. I firmly believe that if you are reading or watching it, then it is at your own fault if you are offended by it. When does anyone even write about offensive things lately anyway? As I said before, if you are reading, watching, or whatever the activity is, it is your own responsibility. @CAPS1 states that when one of you claims to have been offended, you just get rid of that thing and tear it away from our lives. Well, it stops today. I am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other people's lives by getting rid of what other people like to do. If you believe that you should take away our fun and pleasure of doing these things, then go ahead, but remember what you are taking away from those who like to read all of that. If you get rid of the books that keep us entertained, then there will be nothing left on the shelves for any of us. I have written in this newspaper about things that should be left alone. I have also written about how if you do take away our simple things we like to read, just think about what you are taking away from those who read, listen, or watch these things. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of interests and not let the sensitivities of a few dictate what the rest can access.
702	3679	2	3	Libraries @CAPS1't Remove Books. @CAPS2, I would like to start off this story by clearly stating that I don't believe that libraries should remove books if they are considered offensive. If a book is offensive, that's not a valid reason to take it off the shelves. We watch movies in school today showing the past when @LOCATION1 had slaves. I myself don't believe it is fair to show a movie in school about slavery, but we can't have a situation where we can't have a book that doesn't actually show anything to us but just tells us what's going on. In my eyes, a book is less harmful than watching a show on the subject. A movie can show a lot more detailed and graphic content than a book can, so I say let the books stay where they are. Don't try to shut down an author just because you don't like what they wrote. There might be more meaning in the book than you can initially see. Just keep reading; you never know how the story might unfold. It's just like the old saying, don't judge a book by its cover. We @CAPS1't take away a book that someone might like. Someone might hate the book, but just because they hate it, would you stop reading it? I don't believe it is right to remove something just because someone might not like what it is saying. I myself see a lot of things I don't like every day, but I do not try getting everything changed. This is life as I know it. There are a lot of offensive people in this world, and it won't change anytime soon, not for me or anyone. Unless they make a law against being offensive. I can see someone in a band saying something offensive about someone, but we can't stop selling his CDs just because someone might be offended. There are people who might like what he said in that song. Or, I don't like a lot of shows and movies on TV, but I don't try to get the station shut down. I just change the channel. Similarly, if someone in a bookstore sees an offensive book, they should just look away. They shouldn't go and try to get it removed from the shelves. All in all, we should tolerate different viewpoints and not let personal sensitivities lead to the removal of valuable cultural and informational resources.
703	3680	2	3	I will be talking about whether books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion, I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to some people. This is because not all people have the same interests. First of all, I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves just because some people get offended by the items. For instance, if there is an explicit @CAPS1, the people who like it would probably buy it. On the other hand, the people who don't like the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves. Another example can be a book. What if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended? They would return the book and might not want to recommend it to a friend. But then another person comes along and picks the same book and actually likes what he/she reads. That person would probably recommend it to a friend. The same principle applies to magazines as well. What if a person gets offended by an advertisement in a magazine? Just because one person is offended, it shouldn't stop the magazine from being sold. A person who likes it might return it, and then another person who gets offended at it comes along. But it shouldn't stop selling for that particular person. In conclusion, I firmly believe that things in the library shouldn't stop being available just because one person gets offended at it. They should have thought twice before looking at the item in the first place.
704	3681	2	3	Books are books. We all read them and summarize them to find out what we need to know about the past, the future, or mainly what's going on in today's life. So, we shouldn't take books off the shelves, just like we shouldn't do the same with magazines. They might have valuable information to tell people around the world. That's why people write books and publish magazines, so that people like us can read them when we're not busy in life or just relaxing. People read bad stuff all the time in books or magazines. That's what life is about because there's some good stuff and there's some bad stuff to read about. I mean, hey, if you don't want your children reading them, then have them not read at all. Because as they get older, the more they're going to know what's going on in life. There are things that are bad, and you can't really stop them. When they reach that age in their life, they're going to find out somehow or another. There are schools that have a lot of reading material that talks about good things that might be important for their futures. Schools are mainly why kids know what they know now because you have all your history classes. These classes talk about slavery and everything else that's bad. When kids say things outside of the classroom, they get in trouble. So, if they get in trouble outside of class, then why do we teach it or even mention it? History classes are very helpful because they teach you about all the different wars that have happened and who invaded other countries or states. They also help in finding places on a map that shows all the world's states and countries and even where we live in our country. So, really, why would you take stuff off the shelves if other people read them? Mainly, why would you do it since other people have worked very hard and spent their time making books and then having them published, only for you to take them off the shelf? What if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff in a little writing? What's the harm in it anyway? In conclusion, we should respect the effort of authors and the educational value of books and not let personal sensitivities lead to their removal.
705	3682	2	3	For as long as people can remember, books have been banned for various reasons. Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. Though it @MONTH1 be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. It is a fundamental right to be able to obtain the information these materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship. Some @MONTH1 argue that certain material @MONTH1 be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another person feels? Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want their feelings or knowledge to be portrayed. The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech. It is the responsibility of the public to decide how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason. Religion is always a controversial point when it comes to censorship, but isn't freedom of religion enshrined in our constitution? Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most religions have holy books and writings. Many people express their religion through means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material. There are some rare situations when restrictions @MONTH1 need to be upheld, but these should be merely based on age. This, however, doesn't restrict the public as a whole but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or disturbing content unsuitable for children. This way, information is never censored completely. It is never right to tell people what they can or cannot know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorship of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions @MONTH1 be an answer for younger citizens, these materials aren't taken away from the public. Whatever it @MONTH1 be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems. In conclusion, we should uphold the principles of free access to information while also being responsible in protecting the younger generation from inappropriate content.
706	3683	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Some individuals firmly believe that there should be censorship, while others think it shouldn't matter at all. I am of the opinion that there shouldn't be censorship because perhaps some people genuinely like those books. I have three key reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. Firstly, people have their own preferences for certain books and should be able to access whatever they desire. Secondly, the libraries possess the right to put whatever they want on the shelves. Thirdly, if you don't like what the books say, then simply don't get the book. Libraries offer a vast array of books for you to choose from, and you have the freedom to pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because there are people who might want books of that nature. Everybody has their own unique preferences when it comes to the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship would prevent them from getting what they want, which would likely make them frustrated. There is a wide variety of genres of books and music available, and some have stronger language in them compared to other genres. Some people prefer their music uncensored and should be able to obtain it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who purchase the books and music, not you. Libraries have the freedom to acquire whatever books they want and place them on the shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say, then go and get something you do like. There is no rule stating that you have to get a particular kind of music. Some people are fond of the music genre called rap, which does contain some strong language, but it's your choice whether to listen to it or not. The stores simply put the products on the shelf to make money, not to make you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that clearly indicate what genre they belong to. People who want to complain about the language in a book should not have checked it out in the first place. You have the right to inquire about what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings that inform you about the strength of the language used. People cannot claim that there is a need to monitor these when the ratings tell you everything that's in the movie or music. The libraries and stores usually mark the sections according to the genre. This can help you identify where the uncensored parts are. You can avoid those sections if you find them offensive. In conclusion, the libraries should not have to censor their books, and entertainment stores should not need to censor all the music and movies. It's your choice what to get, not theirs. People can steer clear of those areas that they find offensive, and everybody should be able to get what they want, even if it might offend others.
707	3684	2	3	Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didn't want your kids to watch with you? What are you supposed to do when this problem occurs time and time again? Do you just tell your kids to close their eyes and cover their ears? Well, I honestly think that such a situation should never have to happen to you. As a parent or adult, you should be given a warning about certain behaviors that are shown during a movie. These are behaviors that you do not approve of your child watching, even if they are watching with you. It's simply unacceptable, in my opinion. So, I believe that we should have some kind of additional warning indicating that these inappropriate behaviors are present in movies. Parents should be able to know whether what their kids are about to watch is suitable for their age or not. To sum it all up neatly, we should create some kind of label that states there might be content in movies, as well as other items such as books and magazines, that parents may find inappropriate for a child to watch or read. If the people who produce these products do this, it will be much easier for parents to make the right decisions for their children. In conclusion, implementing such labels would greatly assist parents in protecting their children from unsuitable content, ensuring a more informed and responsible viewing and reading experience.
708	3685	2	3	I think that a library should primarily consist of books because that's what they are originally intended for. If we started including movies in libraries, then one might wonder why we even bother putting books in libraries. I believe it should be either one or the other. If movies were available in libraries, I think that people would be more inclined to borrow movies than books. And just imagine what it would be like if we also added music to libraries. I do consider a magazine to be a type of book. Movies should remain in movie stores or at the movie theater, not in libraries. Music should be listened to on the radio or purchased from stores, not stored in libraries. If people started introducing movies and music into libraries, people would likely lose interest in books. I think there is an attempt to incorporate technology into libraries, and I am not in favor of that. If music and movies were available at libraries, there would be no real need for books, and people would stop buying them. We need books as they are the oldest and most accurate way to express oneself or tell a story. However, now people seem to prefer movies or music. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their focus on books to preserve the traditional and valuable role they play in providing knowledge and literary experiences, and avoid diluting this purpose by introducing movies and music.
709	3686	2	3	Censorship The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship. Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing? I am going to list a few ways that I think censorship is bad and also why it is good. The first aspect I am going to talk about is how it is bad. The negative part about censorship is that it can easily offend people. Most people can tolerate a certain amount of offensive content, but on the other hand, a lot of people cannot. In my opinion, it is acceptable to have some things out there that may offend people because that is how a lot of people find humor. For example, political cartoons often make fun of the government and many of the other people in office, but you don't see them complaining about it. In my view, if you don't like it, then simply don't read it. That's all you need to do, and it will never bother you again. However, on the other hand, I can understand how some people can get offended. Some of the content in books and movies can be extremely mean. I think that there should be some kind of boundary that separates going too far and what is considered acceptable. Most people can deal with it, but others cannot. For instance, there is a significant amount of offensive language in certain media, especially in this time period. Wherever you go, there is always some form of offensive content. In conclusion, I think that people need to come together and establish a clear line before things go too far. Some of the existing offensive content should be removed from the shelves, but not everything. By finding a balance, we can respect different sensitivities while still allowing for freedom of expression.
710	3687	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. We all have a basic understanding of what's wrong and what's right. Every school is unique. Some schools impose limits on the books that students can access. For example, if a two - year - old is reading a book that is clearly too advanced or inappropriate, such as a book filled with complex themes or adult content, that would be a problem. Similarly, if a sixteen - year - old is reading a book that is overly inappropriate for their age, it's not suitable. Every age group has different needs and capabilities, so you're not likely to find a forty - three - year - old homeless person on the streets reading a children's book like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. Most likely, they'll be reading a mystery book or something appropriate for their age, not something meant for a five - year - old. Books shouldn't be banned just because some elementary school mothers don't want their seven - year - old reading '@CAPS4'. Just because a few parents want a book banned doesn't mean it should be. Parents should be more vigilant and monitor what their kids are reading. It shouldn't be necessary to ban a book from other children just because one parent doesn't want their child to read it. Don't we all agree that music is an important part of life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. There are many musical artists in the world who rely on music for their livelihood. So, why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking? I say it doesn't matter. If you don't like it, don't listen to it. You don't have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, and in my opinion, nothing should be banned. For example, I personally dislike Christian songs because I find them too slow and they constantly talk about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should prevent others from enjoying them. Everyone is different, and no one is exactly the same. Music helps me get through life, and I know it helps others as well. It shouldn't be banned. Movies and video games are also popular forms of entertainment. We all enjoy cuddling up and watching movies together, but not all movies are suitable for everyone. Movies and video games have ratings. These ratings indicate what is appropriate for a twelve - year - old compared to a twenty - five - year - old. Adults are more likely to play rated @CAPS6 games and watch rated @CAPS7 movies, while little kids around the age of six would play rated @CAPS8 games and watch rated @CAPS9 movies. As you can see, everyone has different preferences and capabilities when it comes to these forms of entertainment. Rated @CAPS7 movies usually contain gore, sexual themes, strong language, and other things that little kids should never watch. However, this doesn't mean they should be banned. They can be blocked in your home if you don't want your children to access them, but a complete ban is unnecessary. In conclusion, I believe that all movies, books, music, video games, etc., should not be banned. Instead, they should be carefully monitored to ensure that they end up in the right hands and are viewed by the appropriate audience. We should be responsible enough to choose the material for ourselves. Of course, if you are a youth, your parents should supervise the material you consume. This way, we can respect individual differences and still maintain a safe and enjoyable entertainment environment.
711	3688	2	3	Censorship in libraries? That could be a good and a bad thing. Is it truly that significant for kids to encounter some inappropriate content in books? Will authors actually remove their books from libraries due to censorship? Censorship in Libraries is not as necessary as most people assume. Children nowadays are well - informed and quite intelligent about certain subjects. I understand that parents don't want their children to read books containing drugs, alcohol, sex, etc. However, they're going to have to learn about these things sometime in their lives. They might as well get an early start on it now. Young children most of the time aren't even interested in picking up those kinds of books anyway. If you censor all the books in the libraries, then some students would face difficulties in projects they need those kinds of books for. Say I needed a book on alcohol for a project I'm doing in my science class. If the books are censored, then I would have no sources to obtain information from.   On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored. No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex and drugs they saw in a book at school. If I were a parent, I would be concerned myself. But if it's such a big deal to some adults, then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff, only worse, on TV? Commercials about condoms and advertisements promoting drug - like substances. At least with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you.   If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors the impetus to do the same. Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody. Books are a key to learning! We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are. Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them. Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but that's what children do when they're immature. You have to expect that from kids nowadays. No matter how explicit they are, they're informational books and we need them to learn. In conclusion, while censorship may seem like a solution to protect children, it has far - reaching negative consequences and open communication between parents and children is a better approach.
712	3689	2	3	NO, I do not think that books, music, magazines, and other media should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Books help people in numerous ways. Music helps people find their motivation and outlet in many ways. Also, magazines assist people in accomplishing tasks that are meant to be done.   The reason I said books help people is because it broadens one's knowledge, enabling them to understand things better. It also strengthens one's vocabulary, making it more robust than it once was. Last but not least, it helps people become more focused. When saying that, I mean that it teaches you how to focus on the main idea and the whole concept of the book. When people read and don't understand what they're reading, they delve deeper to try and understand the words they misunderstood, which is beneficial because you will learn a lot more than you thought you would.   Music is also a very useful thing to have. It calms people when they've had a long, stressful day at work, school, the doctor's office, or other places. Music also stimulates your creativity, which means you're more inclined to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to paint. When I'm tired and have had a long day, I like to go home, lay down, and listen to music because I feel relaxed and more at ease.   Last but not least, magazines. Magazines provide a wealth of information that one might be seeking. Just say that you were looking for a recipe and you don't have a computer but you have magazines. You can look in a magazine and see when this recipe was effective and by whom it was written. Also, if you were to want to order some things such as shoes, clothes, perfume fragrances, lotions, and some even order household things if needed. When I look in a magazine, I like to order shoes or even just compare the prices of something store - bought or the magazine price. There are many different things you can look forward to when looking in a magazine. So take my advice and try it because sometimes what you're looking for can be right in your library.   With all that being said, books, music, and magazines can be very helpful to you and anybody else. Books are very useful when it comes to writing essays or other academic tasks. Music is very beneficial when you've had a long day at your workplace or other activities. Magazines are very self - explanatory when it comes to food, clothing, shoes, topics, essays, cars, houses, etc. When you have a question, a concern, or maybe even a doubt, you can go to your nearest personal library and borrow or read a book, magazine, or listen to a little music. All these things can be helpful, and all you have to do is take in the information and take advantage of the free knowledge that is available to you. In conclusion, these forms of media offer diverse benefits and should not be removed just because they might be offensive to some.
713	3690	2	3	There are people who are offended by all kinds of things. So what difference does it make if someone writes a book that someone else doesn't like? It shouldn't matter if someone does not agree with someone else's decision on a book because someone else might like his or her book. There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that someone will not like, and that's just part of life, if you ask me. So I think having books that some people don't like is a great thing to have in our world. It shows whether people are going out to see what is going on in our world, if people are really caring about what other people write or say to other people.  There is just one thing that people should always keep in mind when they are writing a movie or even in your local newspaper. The articles that some people put in the movies and papers are sometimes taken a little too far by what people say. I do believe that there should be a line as to what you can and cannot write in a book, and I think that should be determined by the writer's best judgment.  Why do some people complain about everything that is meant to be told to them? It's because they know that what he or she is saying is very true and they don't want other people to know their past if it is bad or if something tragic has happened to them, whether it be in their family or something bad has happened to them. But I think if somebody would talk to this person, they would not get so mad at someone for speaking the truth to the public.  Well, you have heard my side of the story on what I think about people getting mad at other people for what they say. I believe that what you say is very true, that we do have freedom in this country. In conclusion, while there should be some boundaries in writing, we should respect the diversity of opinions and the freedom of expression, and address our concerns through communication rather than complaints.
714	3691	2	3	Censorship seems like a great idea at first thought! It allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them. Consequently, censorship in libraries creates the possibility for every book ever written to be removed from shelves around the world. There are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship. It creates objections due to differences in opinions and authors being completely and utterly offended. Censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries.   People have different criteria when it comes to deciding a level of offensiveness. For instance, if a fifty - year - old conservative female read a violent book with some curse words and sexual content, she might think that it was offensive. Likewise, if a twenty - one - year - old, carefree male read the exact same book, he would probably enjoy its content. This difference in opinion poses as a huge problem in allowing libraries to censor their selection. I feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy.   Instead of completely banning some texts, why not move them to another section of the library? Libraries could take some time to separate the books into categories, and the books that they feel are offensive could go into a separate section of the library. This section could be as simple as a separate shelf, or could go to the extreme of a separate room or area closed in by a curtain. Either way, completely getting rid of books because of their content is a terrible idea.   Authors could potentially lose money from the action of censorship. They put in numerous hours and a great deal of effort to write books and novels. Some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces. Magazines and movies require the same amount of time, but they also incur an unimaginable amount of money. If these authors, directors, and producers have their specific product taken off of the shelves, it would be offensive to them. They could have a decrease in sales which would cause a decrease in money as well. The idea is simply unfair.   Librarians have the right to display the content of which they choose, but making them remove products that they feel are fine is ridiculous. I think that censorship is a terrible idea. If anything should be banned from a library, it should be censorship itself! In conclusion, censorship in libraries undermines the rights of both creators and consumers, and alternative solutions like sectioning should be considered to preserve the freedom of access to diverse materials.
715	3692	2	3	Have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories? Everybody is different and has their own opinion about what they think is right. It is alright to have different beliefs, but that shouldn't mean people shouldn't seek to understand others. I believe that the censorship in libraries is very important, but that people need to seek to understand each other more, not be so stubborn, and look at different perspectives so that people can get along easier.   Many different materials are found in libraries, and some of them are more censored than others. Many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories. People have the right to free speech, so they should be able to show others what they believe, but they need to make sure that showing what they know is not hurting anyone else. Explicit movies and music are very poor at promoting understanding. They are good because of the rating systems, but still, they can be quite insensitive to others.   Many people simply take the ideas of others the wrong way. People have trouble looking at things from different perspectives, and because of it, they can cause conflicts. If people would seek to understand more, then the conflicts of different beliefs would not be as common. When people have different perspectives, they can be more knowledgeable of various opinions.   Some people are just stubborn. They choose to only believe their ideas and refuse to listen to anyone else's. Being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand. If people were less stubborn, they could see more perspectives and become more aware of how others felt. When people are stubborn, it can be very hard for others to deal with them or for them to get along well with others.   In conclusion, I do think censorship is important, but I think that the reasons why we censor things are equally important as well. If people were more understanding of others, then we could have more censorship for the things that aggravate other people. We would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread their ideas. If people sought to understand, looked for different perspectives, and were not so stubborn, then they would get along much better. By fostering understanding and open - mindedness, we can strike a better balance in the use of censorship in libraries.
716	3693	2	3	I understand how some people, especially during certain times of the month (@MONTH1), get offended by some things they watch or read. However, that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it just because one person doesn't like it. It's truly a matter of opinion whether something is offensive or not. I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced, they rate it so that you can clearly know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with some offensive parts to it, then they put with the rating that yes, there is some rude language and such. So just because somebody didn't read closely enough to see that there might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie. Personally, I don't find books to be the greatest things, but I'm sure that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them, yet it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book might be inappropriate for some readers, then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people read that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it. If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc. off of the shelves, I wouldn't. I say this because a high percentage (@PERCENT1) of the time, things have been rated or in some way approved to be put on general store shelves. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new CD or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelves, I would be upset about it because it probably wouldn't even offend me at all. So no, I completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by its content.
717	3694	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the young adult (@CAPS1) or teen (@CAPS2) section, easy children or picture and young adult (@CAPS1). The young adult or the teen section is mainly for the teens. They have books that a typical teen would read. The teen section also has music which teens usually listen to. For instance (@CAPS4), they have the twilight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language. The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the selection of books offered to them. It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed. There is also a children's section called the easy or picture book section. This section is for the younger children, those who are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music and movies in this section are about cartoons and animals, things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For example (@CAPS4), this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, Arthur, even Lilo and Stitch. Everything in this section is made for children and there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent would think is offensive. The library has a section for adults. The adult (@CAPS1) section is there to catch adults' eye. It is separate from the teen (@CAPS2) and children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an adult who thinks that something is offensive, they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in their section. The library keeps the adults' section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want. The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people, I don't think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies, music etc.
718	3695	2	3	"When people think of libraries, they often picture this cold place with an old mad lady telling you to be quiet. Or they just picture books everywhere. But libraries today have been way more improved and advanced with music, movies, and other media. When I was young, I never really liked libraries because they seemed boring to me. That's why I wasn't good at reading either until I was in the sixth grade because I discovered that the library was actually a cool place. They have different things to do like look up books, music, or movies that you can check out from the libraries. Or sometimes you might have magazines you can check out too. Then at the libraries, there are people who don't like the new additions like music and movies. The reason is that they are used to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens. That's why the faithful regulars who go to the libraries every day take the new things as an offense to the library. When it all boils down, this topic makes me think about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (@CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3) because it was an offensive book talking about how the whites treated the negroes back then. The reason I say that is because old traditions in the library are like the whites in the story and the new things in the library are like the negroes who were outcasted by the whites. Then in the book, it took one little girl to settle the differences and know what's right and wrong. That's why I think instead of banning or removing stuff, we should have discussions. Through which we can come to an agreement to keep new ideas in the libraries. When we do keep the ideas, maybe we can make a section for those new ideas so the people who come to the library wouldn't get offended."
719	3696	2	3	Everywhere one goes, something is being kept from them. It is either to keep them safe, pure, or happy. In the everyday world, people who break the law are put into jails and prisons. Not only is it a punishment for them, but it is also to keep them away from other people. This is much like how our libraries are becoming. Books that have questionable content are being thrown out. I do not believe that this should be done. Books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own. People should be able to choose what they read (@CAPS5) and if it offends them, they can choose by themselves to stop reading that book. Many times I have learned new things from books that might not have been appropriate for my age, but it taught me a valuable lesson. For example, I read (@CAPS5) a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations, she became pregnant and it ruined her life. From this, at the age of ten years old, I learned that I do not want that to happen to me, so I am abstaining from adult relations until I am married. Of course, the libraries should be separated into different categories such as: children's (@CAPS1), young adult (@CAPS2), adult (@CAPS3), mature (@CAPS4), and Read at Your Own Risk (@CAPS5 at Your Own @CAPS6). Also, the same with magazines and music. That way, a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there. This is much like the movie ratings. A mother can pick up a movie and see that it is rated PG (@CAPS7) and know that it is acceptable for her nine - year old to watch, except possibly save for a few curse words, but a child hears that in their everyday life anyways, whether the parent knows it or not. In conclusion, I believe that literature should not be censored from the people. However, it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for. People have the right to choose what books they read (@CAPS5) and what they learn about. Everyone can learn a valuable lesson from any book, it just depends on how they interpret it.
720	3697	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. The main reason I say that is because there are not just positive things in this world, but there are also a lot of negatives. It is very important for children to learn and understand the things that are going on in the world they live in regardless of whether they are good or bad. Everyone is going to have to learn about the things going on around them sooner or later, so it is better to find it out as a child rather than later on in life when you might not have someone there to explain it all to you. I understand, there are some age limits that should be enforced because of some of the foul nature of them. Though at some point and time before a child becomes an adult, they should know most of the basics of life no matter how positive or negative. Children should not be sheltered at a young age to just young adult things because they need to know what else is out there in the world. For example, children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world. If they don't understand that, something bad could happen to them because they did not know the dangers around them because they never learned it. When I was younger, it was required to know other people outside of your race or religion because not just your race or religion is in this world. Also, we learned the difference between good and bad choices. If us children did not learn that at an early age, many of them would be in some very rough situations today. On the other hand, there is an extent to which children need to learn also. For example, say you buy a video game for your child, but make sure you enforce to them that killing and shooting is not something that they should be doing out in the real world. Make sure you teach them the difference between reality and fakeness. That is a main reason why kids today do not have self - control because of the things they learn off of video games. Nowadays on television (@CAPS1), there are people being pressured by the media to act out of their character just to get attention. They are publicizing sexual and inappropriate things for children to be learning about at a young age, but they need to be aware that it's out there and it is bad. In magazines, they will distort famous people's bodies to make them look like something they are not to make people feel like they are not good enough. Children should be taught that not everything they see, hear, and read are not always right or true. With today's media and materials, it is easy to know the difference between right and wrong, but they put it out there as if one person is doing it, it is ok for everyone to be doing it. In most cases, it is not until that person understands all of the facts about it and can make rational decisions on their own and on their own time. Children nowadays will get pressured by media, magazines, and sometimes by peers. The media is telling them to do something that is not necessarily right, but is popular. You should not teach your children off of things like that as it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on. With today's magazines, the writers will make people look like something they really are not just to make them look good. That is not fair to readers, the person that is being exposed, or the author themselves. Finally, with peer pressure today, kids will see something off of television and try it then try and get their friends to do it even though they know it is not the right thing to do. I believe that children, when they are faced with dilemmas like these, should know right from wrong with the trouble they are facing. If they know nothing about it, they need to walk away or learn how to say no regardless of how hard it might be. In conclusion, I believe that the children nowadays that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it. Also, they should know the right ways to handle it when they are put in certain situations. Lastly, I believe kids should know what is going on around them so when they grow up they know how to fend for themselves, and not be counting on someone else to tell them basic things that are going on in the world around them.
721	3698	2	3	In @DATE1, there is a proliferation of rap/hip-hop artists. These artists commonly sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. The content in @DATE1's rap music is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. It's concerning that there are children who know the words to a lot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also play a role in whether the children learn these words or not. I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. It's true that there are other genres of music that deal with all of the things I listed above. However, I don't think it is right for young children to learn about these things. Just imagine how you would feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are or what alcohol is. I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves, but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age. In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even choose a different genre that doesn't use those such topics as much. For me, country music is very peaceful. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listen to. I will sometimes listen to rap music, but I would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version. Magazines also have a lot to do with why children are so'street' smart these days. Magazines often put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someone's attention, and it works most of the time. Children also see that. They are young and naive, so they will do what they see someone else do, which includes looking at the magazines with good - looking men or women on them. Another subject is the movies that are coming out in @DATE1 world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally, the movies that are inappropriate for children are rated @ORGANIZATION1, but children will still find a way to see @DATE1 stuff. A child could be on the internet, and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are like viruses just waiting for children to click on them unintentionally. These are my strong opinions on what we should do with today's society. We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching. I know that we can't watch their every move, but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch. Thank you for your time!
722	3699	2	3	My views on censorship are that I don't believe in any type of censorship. Books, music, and movies should not be censored. When it comes to children, it should be the parents' responsibility to carefully choose what they feel children should and shouldn't read, watch, or listen to. Taking books, movies, and music off the shelves isn't fair to those who want to read, watch, or listen to them, nor is it fair to the authors, directors, or musicians. People should have the freedom to write whatever they want. The reader doesn't have to agree or enjoy the things the author is saying, but it is the author's freedom to express their thoughts. In a free - thinking society, everyone's right to create and consume content as they wish should be respected.
723	3700	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it. I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases. One reason why I think there should be censorship is because minors in @MONTH1 may want to see things that @MONTH1 may not be suitable for them. First of all, children often follow after what they see, like adult trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are appropriate for young eyes. That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read, and/or listen to. Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music. Violence is a main topic in newspaper articles. For instance, most front - page content is about the wars and hostility in the world. It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to maintain a more mature role that will make a better environment. Since libraries are public and open to all eyes, we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves. In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do. Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon? Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see. So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship. We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries? We should keep these things separate: adult books, magazines, movies, music, etc., to ensure a more suitable environment for all.
724	3701	2	3	Censorship. If someone does not like what a book, magazine, movie, etc., shows, then they should simply put it back up and not worry about it. But there are people who do make a big deal about that kind of stuff. Most people who do, I personally think, are immature. Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings. This is because of nude statues and the way the language was used in the past. A lot of the old plays were very sexual, and many people find them offensive today. Sometimes, there is no way of getting around inappropriate materials. However, there are also a lot of people who find those subjects very interesting and like to study them. So, by taking those books off the shelf, those people would not have any way of researching those materials, and therefore they would get upset and complain. The music that is out today has a lot of inappropriate words and sayings in it that would be offensive to most people. But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it. Most of the time, they aren't really listening to the words but just like the beat of the song. Almost all of the older people hate this music, never want to hear it, and think it should be banned. What they don't realize is that if it was taken out of the library, there would be more upset and angry people than happy ones. Magazines and movies today have a lot of inappropriate advertisements and pictures, but now that is what most people like and want to see. You can't really take anything out of a library because either way, there would be a lot of upset people. Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely cause the number of visitors that come to the library to go down. This is because what they are interested in would not be there anymore, so they would have no reason to go anymore. That is what most likely would happen if the books, magazines, movies, music, etc., were found offensive and were taken off the shelves.
725	3702	2	3	"From what I've seen in my life about censorship, I believe that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content. I think that libraries should keep the things on the shelves but separate them from the rest if found offensive. It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing, which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it. I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people want to know why they censored it in the first place. My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended. I like the saying ""sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt"" because it says if you're offended then get over it. Why should your opinion speak for everyone else? Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is that if someone really wants to know, they could always find a way to get it, so the censorship thing is kind of pointless. I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored, and when people get into the real world, they get hit hard. My conclusion is that they should separate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library. They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it. Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have to look at the stuff that he hates, and others can access the content they want."
726	3703	2	3	I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship over books, movies, music, magazines, etc. People who spend their time writing all of their thoughts and ideas into these creations should not have their works just thrown off the shelf. These writers have the freedom of speech and the right to write and say what they wish.   Yes, I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I don't think they should be removed from libraries. They are there because some other people, like those in @MONTH1, enjoy that kind of stuff. There's no reason why we should exclude what they like to read from the libraries that everyone shares and visits. If we start removing offensive materials, there would be hardly anything left in libraries because almost everything out there could potentially offend someone.   For example, consider people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music contain a lot of bad stuff, but most of his music is about his own life. He has the freedom of speech to write and publish his work for the world to see and hear. His music is just a reflection of his life. In history, there are also figures like @CAPS2 who are controversial because of their actions, like killing people. Should we take books about them off the shelf just because some, like Jews in @MONTH1, find it offensive? It might be offensive, but it allows people to know about our history and what has happened. If we keep censoring such information, history might repeat itself, which is a saying I've heard many times.   So, whether it's about censorship or not, I just think that people have the freedom of speech to write their thoughts down and have them placed in a library for people to see, learn, educate themselves, and be entertained. Just because something offends you doesn't mean it's offensive to others. We should respect the diversity of ideas and expressions in libraries.
727	3704	2	3	Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines, and other media material in libraries should be censored? Why should information and knowledge be withheld from people? Learning is not only exceptional for the person reading but also for the entire human race.   There are two arguments regarding censorship in libraries. I firmly believe in not allowing censorship in libraries. In the @ORGANIZATION1, every individual is granted the right of free speech. Taking someone's work and blocking it because it is deemed 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that person's rights. Also, people go to libraries with the intention of finding out new things. They seek knowledge, and restricting a person's learning capacity can be harmful to everyone. Once one article gets censored, it often leads to another article being censored, and soon, most material will be labeled as 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' Eventually, we will end up taking away mankind's capacity to learn.   Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses, such as inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines. Additionally, there is the issue of obscene graphic material in movies and magazines. These are relatively small issues that can be addressed. Censorship can create a clean version of the content. These are all minor adjustments that are relatively easy to make.   Taking media off the shelves is not necessary. The material usually isn't serious enough to warrant such extreme measures. Minor adjustments can be made so that people can still be allowed to read, listen, or watch. A library is meant to provide what the people want to learn. Taking that away is a very serious matter as it undermines the purpose of libraries and the pursuit of knowledge.
728	3705	2	3	To me, it's not good to have some music, books, or movies removed. It's not fair because people usually read or sing what they feel. Most of the time, people express themselves through their reading and singing choices, based on what they feel within themselves. That's why I think music, books, and movies should not be removed. When you remove these, you're taking away people's talents. I don't think it's okay to do that to those who work hard to do what they like. Just because of something they say or do, you can't just remove their creative output.   If people don't like certain things, they can simply choose not to listen to it or watch it. They can just shift their attention to something else. Removing music and books is wrong because it doesn't just affect one thing. You'll end up removing more than you think. You'll make them lose everything they like or love to sing or write in their books. It's more than just a book or a song to them; it's an expression of their self.   I say no to censorship because that's what they like to do. If you don't like it, don't force others to stop. Instead of making a big deal out of it and ruining their lives by having their work taken away, you should just respect their choices. We should allow people to express themselves freely through their creative works.
729	3706	2	3	Turn @CAPS1, whenever I see a book that I don't particularly care for, I simply put it down. I really don't see the need to deal with all books that might be offensive to a single person or a group of people.   Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, when I see these books, I don't make a big fuss about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I can't even imagine how scarce our book selection would be if we were to get rid of all books that people might find offensive.   Also, there are many people who find The @CAPS3 offensive. If we were to remove all @CAPS4 text from libraries, then we would have a difficult time spreading the word of @CAPS5 to people who do not have access to such literature.   Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I don't like @PERSON1's book on evolution; but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and beliefs.   As you can clearly see, I am not claiming to be completely open - minded to every thought or belief. However, when it comes to literature and art, I think that a variety makes us unique. If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, our culture would be very boring. That's certainly not the foundation on which this great country was built. We should embrace the diversity of literature and art in libraries.
730	3707	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,   There are many books, music, and magazines that are filled with offensive words or obscene themes. However, just because a book or song contains a foul word does not mean that the book should be hidden from the public's view. There are many reasons why we should not censor public media.   We cannot ignore the wrongdoings happening in our world. If a bystander sees a person being abused in a hallway or alley, they can't just pretend it never happened. Similarly, if the world never reported accidents, there would be an overwhelming amount of crime and terror. Sometimes, a book or movie serves as a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about the wrongs in the world today. Most of the time, I learn about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a sanitized version of it. After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people might not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.   Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech. We are allowed to express our opinions on any topic and describe it in any way we choose. We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though deep down, we should know what is right and wrong. People should at least be trusted to use their own conscience.   Another reason why books and other media should not be censored is that people might start to judge almost every little word as offensive. Then, according to Katherine Paterson, we might have 'no books left on the shelf.' Once people are given the power to censor books or other media, they will start looking for words with negative connotations. If a word seems close to being offensive from one person's perspective, it will be removed. As a result, many words will be gone.   Sure, some types of media, especially songs and movies, may contain nasty themes and foul language. However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song. I can always change the radio station if I don't like what I'm hearing. People cannot simply take away the right of others to express themselves, no matter how bad the content might seem. We can't pretend that we live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring. If we hear about something wrong in the world today, we need to take action. But we might not act if we don't know the full extent of its horror.   In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of speech and the importance of uncensored media in helping us understand the world and make informed decisions.
731	3708	2	3	Everyone likes to indulge in the pleasures of watching movies, jamming to some music, and getting lost in an interesting book. Therefore, everyone should be able to freely read, watch, or listen to what they desire, just like other people are reading, listening to, and watching. There are times when one needs to look up or examine certain things while doing a project. Other people simply wish to be entertained by specific pieces of literature or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things for research, in libraries? Many people have a penchant for violent writing or gory movies. Reading these things also amuses them. So why take away what they like? If a library removes certain books from their shelves, then they could be depriving people of a type of literature they are interested in. If one takes away a book that twenty people enjoy reading, then those twenty people might not want to read anything else. People differ in many ways. That includes the wide variety of things humans are interested in. For example, the things they like to read. Humans have major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. The articles, magazines, or movies might not be suitable for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's something someone needs for a project, then there is no valid reason to get rid of it. Some books often offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gains its uniqueness from what it says. Some books are written in times of racism. This shouldn't make a book worthy of criticism because that was the way things were said in that era. It allows the book to convey a feeling of living in the time it is based in. On the other hand, some magazines are written about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events happening in the world. They want to know what is truly going on across seas or even around home. Someone can't know what's happening if no one lets them read the magazine. Authors and writers create these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. Due to the wide variety of interests people have, there are numerous different types of writings. People shouldn't have their favorite book taken off the shelves just because the person next to them found the book offensive. That just wouldn't be fair. Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others can enjoy them. In conclusion, libraries should respect the diverse interests of the public and refrain from unnecessary censorship to ensure that everyone can access the materials they need and enjoy.
732	3709	2	3	When you go to a library, you expect it to be a place that has a positive influence. You're not thinking, when you send your kids there, that there will be inappropriate things. Most people go to the library to study or use the computers. But what about the other people? I went to the library and saw racist books that most adults, especially African - Americans, would find offensive. The thing is, some people go there and check out these books to study about the old times. They are not there to offend people. Some books are very informative, and people need to study and learn about the past so that history doesn't repeat itself. Another problem most people have is with the adult books. Parents definitely don't want their children looking through or checking out those books. But when no one stops them from checking the books out, there really isn't much you can do about it. I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certain books. The last thing is the music. It has bad language in it, and kids can just check it out without even trying hard. Most parents try to shield their kids so they will be well - behaved and not use dirty language. But when they go to a community place and can listen to anything, it causes a problem. Personally, I think that it gives the library a bad name, and therefore, it gets little business. You know that if you were a parent, you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racist, adult books, and music. You would like for the government to take some of the books and music out of the library. I believe that there should be a vote to see if we could have those books and music removed or at least put in an adult section in the back. My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censoring the books and materials they put in the library and make accessible to the community. The up side to doing that is the library would get more customers, and that means the government would make more money. In conclusion, implementing proper censorship measures in libraries through voting or strict control can enhance the library's image and its economic viability while protecting the well - being of the community, especially children.
733	3710	2	3	Does The Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2? There are a lot of books out there that I would love to take off the shelves, but the one book I would most like to take off the shelves would be 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4'. While I read that book, it had a lot of offensive language and a lot of graphic content, not only in the book but also in the movie adaptation. On top of all that, both the movie and the book weren't very good at all. The only thing good about the movie is that there were a few dramatic moments, and that's it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the author liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repetitions. But somehow it got an award and is one of the must - reads for high school students. I think the story overall was alright, beside the fact that there was offensive content in it. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves, and if they are, they need to have the offensive language removed. But obviously, people liked the book, or it wouldn't have won awards. So obviously, 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4' was a good story, but when it comes down to it, it could offend a lot of people. I hear people talking about the book still, and I read it last year. So, in conclusion, I think there should be censorship in libraries. Libraries should ensure that the books they offer are appropriate for the general public, especially students, and take steps to remove or modify offensive content.
734	3711	2	3	I agree and disagree with the prompt. I think that it is good that everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf, listen to any music, watch all types of movies, or read any type of magazine. Then again, I think it isn't okay. First, the reason for agreeing is because some books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials might not be suitable for most young children. They might use profanity, show naked pictures, or talk about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age. Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing. Also, adults might use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library. So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Then, on the other hand, I think that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off. I say this because if a child is not exposed to what could happen if they use bad language, go out without proper clothing, or watch adult movies, they won't learn what is wrong with it. So this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age. I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permanently. In conclusion, I think that this issue could go both ways. But, the books, movies, music, or magazines that are considered offensive should be moved to a certain area in the library. This way, both the freedom of access and the protection of the vulnerable, especially children, can be balanced.
735	3712	2	3	Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns regarding my views on the censorship in a library. First, I think some of the music they play and allow people to listen to can be a little too graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can hurt the feelings of others. Music should have meaning, and instead of focusing on blood and killing, it should be about the better things in life. Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want to have adult - type material, they should have a separate section just for adults. Reading should be about what you like, but it should also be about what you are able to read. Next, I would like to mention some of the inappropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a bit too much for some of the people that go to the library. Most magazines that are displayed are for adults and teens over a certain age. I believe they should create a section for each age and age group. Finally, I would like to discuss some of the movies they let people check out. Libraries have a graphic selection of movies that are easily accessible to young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to be more aware of their surroundings before they continue with their current practices. In conclusion, I believe that everyone has the right to use a library, but I just feel that everyone doesn't have the right to have unrestricted access to everything libraries hold. Bad things can create bad minds, and we have to learn to stay above those influences. Libraries need to change some of their ways and their selections to make things more successful on their behalf. By implementing proper censorship and categorization, libraries can better serve the needs and well - being of all their patrons.
736	3713	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Books generally serve to entertain readers and even teach them in certain aspects of life. While not all books are offensive, some indeed are. Such offensive books should be taken off the shelves, especially if they are in a school library. Children might take the offensive or violent content in these books and act upon it. Moreover, they could show these books to their peers. Additionally, children can easily get offended by such content. So, should offensive books be removed from the shelves?  Children today are highly influenced. Whether it's through television shows, video games, or music, there have been news reports about children being influenced to possess guns or even attempt self - harm. Books are supposed to entertain readers in a positive way, not teach them to become violent. Some readers might turn the offensive words in books into real - life actions, which could land the student in trouble, and this is something people don't want.  Children have a habit of showing off to their friends. If a student spots something offensive or violent in a book, there's a high probability that they'll show it to their classmates, simply because they think it's cool. Having one person read such content can be a problem, but imagine an entire group of friends seeing it. This could lead to a huge issue, not only for the children and their parents but also for the school. The children learning new and inappropriate things from the book might start using them in daily life, and this could give the school a bad reputation. Passing on such information can cause conflicts, which no one desires.  School is not just a place for learning; it's also a social environment. Every school has different groups of students, each with their own unique characteristics such as skin color, religion, style, and personality. Children are easily hurt. If books contain offensive content, it can quickly hurt those who read them. Once again, books are meant to entertain, not to cause harm. So, why do some authors include offensive content in their books? Maybe they want to add interest and suspense, but not all readers can handle it well. Hurting others is not a pleasant thing to do, and people definitely don't want to be part of it.  In conclusion, having offensive books on the shelves is a bad idea. These books can incite children to act out, show off to their friends, and cause emotional pain. Children already face many challenges in life; there's no need to make it worse. Books should fulfill their purpose of entertaining readers. Therefore, it's best to remove offensive books, and this way, many potential problems can be avoided.
737	3714	2	3	Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I think some things should be removed is that some kids don't need to be exposed to certain inappropriate content. Parents can't always accompany their children to the library and guide them on what they can and can't borrow. At school libraries, the materials are usually pre - approved and relatively safe. However, public libraries have a much wider range of materials compared to school libraries.  For instance, in a public library, there could be books with explicit sexual content or magazines with violent images that are not suitable for young kids. These materials might have a negative impact on children's mental and moral development. Since parents can't always be present to monitor their children's choices, it becomes necessary to remove such offensive materials from the shelves.  In conclusion, considering the potential harm that offensive materials can cause to children and the difficulty parents face in constantly supervising their children's access to these materials, it is reasonable to remove certain offensive materials from the shelves. This will help create a safer and more appropriate environment for children to access information.
738	3715	2	3	Censorship  In our daily lives, we often come across things that we consider inappropriate and think should be removed. But do we have the right to take that particular item off the shelves to prevent its spread? And is it beneficial for the future of children to keep them away from such materials in stores, libraries, and bookstores?  Most cartoons contain violence. In fact, almost all of them do. In every conflict within these cartoons, violence is often the solution. Children sit down to watch these cartoons without fully understanding that the violence they see is wrong. They may not realize that they shouldn't imitate the violent behavior shown on TV. Similarly, some shows and movies are not suitable for kids.  The same goes for books. Nowadays, kids are attracted to new book series based on movies, like the Twilight series. These books also have elements of violence. If parents were to censor what their children could read, many of these books would be removed from the shelves, especially for young readers.  Newspapers also report on violence. For the safety of children, if they see such reports, they might be curious and want to see if the events are still happening. Children's safety is of utmost importance as we care about their future and the kind of information they consume from books, TV, movies, and newspapers.  All these reasons justify giving parents some control over what their children read, hear, and view on a daily basis. Even though cartoons show violence, children can still watch and enjoy them, but they should not act out the violent scenes or repeat the inappropriate language.  In conclusion, censorship is necessary to protect children from the negative influence of violent and inappropriate materials in various media. By allowing parents to have some say in what their children are exposed to, we can help ensure a healthier and more positive development for the younger generation.
739	3716	2	3	Should libraries remove offensive reading material? No, I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just because some people find it offensive. There's offensive material everywhere in our daily lives. Just because you find something offensive doesn't mean someone else will have the same opinion. In my opinion, if a person finds something offensive, they should simply avoid looking at or reading it.  A few months ago, I was at the library, searching for a book to read for an essay I had to write. I overheard two girls having an argument. One girl asked, 'What's this book about?' The other girl replied, 'That's a really good book! It's about two people who fall in love and their love lives. It goes on to describe how the man tries to find a new partner after the girl he loved passes away and his love life after she's gone.' The first girl then asked, 'So you're saying it's about sex?' The other girl answered, 'Yes, but only slightly.' The first girl exclaimed, 'I'm not going to read this!' The second girl, confused, asked, 'But why not?' The first girl replied, 'Because it talks about sex! Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this. It sends the wrong message.'  After those girls left, I went and got the book they were discussing. I started reading it. To my surprise, it was quite interesting. In fact, it was a very well - written book. The second girl was right. It wasn't mainly about sex. It was mostly about the deep love those two people shared and the struggles the man went through after his beloved's death.  This incident made me think. Should certain reading material be removed just because it mentions sex, drugs, murders, etc., or because someone finds it offensive? No, it shouldn't. There's offensive material in the real world, and it's not being removed. So, why should it be removed from a library? Does it really matter if it's in a book? There will always be something somewhere that offends someone. That's just an inevitable part of life.  In conclusion, removing reading material from libraries based on the offense of some individuals is not a good idea. Libraries should provide a wide range of materials, and it's up to the readers to choose what they want to read. By allowing diverse content, libraries can better serve the different interests and perspectives of their patrons.
740	3717	2	3	Should books, music, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Well, people have the right to access the content they desire and listen to what they like. Some individuals believe it's inappropriate to have offensive materials openly available on the shelves, while others think it's acceptable. I guess it all boils down to personal feelings and perspectives.  Let's assume I'm in the library and I come across something offensive. The world doesn't stop and say, 'Hey, look! This person finds that offensive, so let's take it off the shelves to please them.' Unfortunately, that's not how life operates. If you don't like what you see, the best thing to do is to look the other way. If it were me, I'd focus on more important matters such as global conflicts or the issues in my own life rather than getting worked up about offensive content on the book shelves.  The world is vast, and it's not getting any smaller. There will always be things in life that we find offensive, whether it's something we see or hear. My advice is to just get over it.  The other day, I was at the bait shop, and I heard a word that I'm reluctant to even repeat. I really hate that word. But what could I do? Tell a grown man not to say it? Instead, I just rolled my eyes and continued with my business.  In conclusion, as I've been emphasizing, in life, we're bound to encounter offensive things. We have to learn to deal with them. Although it's not always easy to ignore offensive content, life itself is full of challenges. So, we should focus on the bigger picture and not be overly concerned about having offensive books, music, etc., removed from the shelves.
741	3718	2	3	If I found a book that offended me, I would have to go and take it off the shelf. This is because if I find that a book is offensive, I know that others might think the same. I agree that some books can be offensive to some and not to others, and it's really not fair for those who think that way. One reason that I would take it off the shelf would be to keep young children from reading it. Parents don't really want their children reading about violence and murder. Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist against another person or people, people killing others, and engaging in sexual things. People really shouldn't read things like that because it puts ideas in their heads and sometimes makes them think the same way as the writer. If children read books about violence and sexual actions, they could think that it's okay to do these things to other people and get into a lot of trouble with the law and their parents. Children really need to be kept away from these kinds of books until they're older and understand what's right and what's wrong. Some books have a lot of cursing in them, and a lot of children pick up on words and start using them more and more until it becomes a habit. Even though some books are about real people, they should still be taken off the shelves. In some of these books, there is a lot of violence, and children should not be exposed to that kind of book. Books can sometimes be more bad than good. If everybody had their way and could take a book that offended them off the shelf whenever they wanted, then there would be no books left. In conclusion, while it's important to respect different opinions, protecting children from inappropriate content in books is crucial.
742	3719	2	3	If people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and other media, then they will if they feel it is offensive to others. I wish they would not, but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so. They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing, then they will feel it is okay to say or do those things that they read or hear. It also makes common sense to not do those things that people wrote about. The authors write things to entertain and to educate us about things that were okay in the time period that the story, in this case, was okay back then. Most people these days take things way too seriously, mostly because we have things like lawsuits and discrimination. If someone can find something to complain about, they will do so. If there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1's had slaves and if they're calling them a name that is not very nice, then someone can complain and say that it is racist, and there will be a dispute about it, and the author will most likely lose and have to change that word into something else. People do not realize how much this happens; it happens a lot, especially with books. Movies are a whole different thing. Now, the things that happen in the movies often get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with it. There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4. @CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1. There are certain things that can be in those movies. In @CAPS2 @NUM1, there can be a lot more things; it can be scary to an extent, and there are also sometimes sexual things, but they do not show the whole thing. There can also be villains and some swearing, not a lot though. @CAPS9 @CAPS4 is a whole new level; they can have anything they really want, and it's a little more graphic than @CAPS2 @NUM1. Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4, depending on how graphic things are. Music is a whole other thing, depending on what kind of music you are listening to, like there's @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and so on. With all of those, they talk about sex and violence. Now, all of them except country talk about drugs, and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1. There are some that talk about more things, but most of them talk about those things. If parents do not want their children listening to it, then they don't listen. There are ways of still listening to it. Most radio stations can't swear on the radio, but they just cut it out. There are ways to have the uncut version, but that's on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player. There are ways to get around it. In conclusion, while the issue of offensive media is complex, we should strive to find a balance between freedom of expression and protecting the well - being of the public, especially children.
743	3720	2	3	@CAPS1's viewpoint is that books should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 helps the other person. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library. In a library, everybody should have the right to read every book. The idea of taking a book off the shelf is bad because people want to read books like that. Some people have a problem with that type of book, but if they don't like it, then tell people not to read it, not take it off the shelf. If anything, put it in a different area or just move it; put all that type of book in one area, not mixed in. When people need help, they read a book or look it up. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems, then don't even move it. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive. We don't know all of the reasons, but there are a lot of them. If a movie is not good for children or just very horrid, it @MONTH1 needs to be put in a place where nobody will look. Kids and grown - ups are the same, and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad. Usually when somebody takes something offensive, they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose, but they don't; they write it, and somebody is guilty of something and can not live up to it. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood. Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive, but then the next person read it, and they might think it is funny. The biggest problem is some people can't read well. Then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly. I don't feel like certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 might be feeling guilty of something. If the materials should be moved, they should just be moved to a different area, not off of the shelves totally. If it is taken offensive, they should tell the librarian, and then if very many more people say it is offensive, then it can be taken off the shelf. In conclusion, libraries should be places where diverse ideas are accessible, and the decision to remove a book should be carefully considered.
744	3721	2	3	The belief of whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive depends on the situation the material is relating to. If one wants to see these types of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand it. It all depends on where the material is at in the library and what situation it's in. If it is in the children's area, I highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information. If it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be. In the adult section, however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material. One example of why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called '@CAPS1 tales' or '@CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION1'. These types of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section. Now, from ages @NUM1 years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information. Some teens would be horrified of looking through these books, and others would be fascinated by it. It varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read. It all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in. Another example on whether or not inappropriate material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations. There was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she had never seen before. So once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie. The person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation. If the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine; but she was young still, and so it made the matter worse. Whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed, and it shows that one person can change the difference in the situation. Therefore, whether this type of material should be taken off the shelves depends, once again, on the situation it is at. In conclusion, proper placement and assessment of the maturity level of the audience are essential when dealing with potentially offensive materials.
745	3722	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, we've all had the pleasure of seeing/reading/watching our favorites, but many are considered unsatisfactory in their content to younger children. Parents, now more than ever, are concerned about how their children are raised, and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives. Things with heavy violence, gore, language, and even scenes of sexual content, all of these are wanted by all parents to be censored from their children's eyes. There are many reasons why parents worldwide wish to hide these things from the eyes of the young, such as personal influence, emotional growth, and even the chance of a child becoming disobedient to the parent. These are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye. Again, we've all read or heard things that affect us personally. Maybe you read on how you can make your life happier, or maybe you heard an inspirational song that convinced you to follow your dreams. Well, this is also true for everyday books, movies, magazines, or music. If someone is introduced to something telling of a life with hatred or someone living in a violent way, it can influence a young reader to wish to live the same style of life if it sounds even a little remotely fun. True, children are encouraged to have fun, but to a certain, but safe extent. These are even known to affect someone's emotions. Maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh. But it is true the opposite way as well. Songs that are dark and have a gloomy feeling to them can make a person feel depressed, or a scary movie @MONTH1 can leave a person with a new fear or a nightmare in their sleep the same night. It has even been known that some children are left traumatized for life just because they weren't ready for what they saw in certain violent and gory scenes. These are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe. People are very easily moved by any form of information, song, and story alike. It is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away. Children are easily affected in behavior. Maybe they just saw a movie of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him. If a child is exposed to a movie of great violence or bad influence, the child @MONTH1 then start following what happened in it and begin not listening to their parents. It is only right to keep these bad influences away until they are able to handle things so violent or misfortunate. In conclusion, parents play a crucial role in safeguarding their children from the negative impacts of inappropriate media, and society should support their efforts to create a healthy environment for children's growth.
746	3723	2	3	Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern, Reading material found in a library is not only very useful but also highly informative to the world. There truly is no limit to what could be discovered on paper. Whether it might be offensive or not, imposing limits on books will only create unnecessary tension, have a negative effect on the economy, and will, ironically enough, lead to illegal activity. In such a situation, offensive books will be written and sold completely undercover. In today's world, it would be nearly an impossible task to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some minor issue with something in the present - day world, and because of that, original and unoffensive material is extremely hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally but will also be out of a job and will have significantly less income. Since it is virtually impossible to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, as most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the shelves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries. Books cost money; to produce books costs money, and to buy books also costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose - dive in the market, having almost no clientele. When a major division such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, in the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the lead by a large margin. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond of. People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation holds for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intelligent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuade others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences. Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the shelves is how the people are pleased or motivated.
747	3724	2	3	Well to begin my Persuasive @CAPS1. THATS @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! How could they make such a decision? Don't we have a say in this?.... Well.... WE SHOULD!!!! This is a little bit about what I think of this letter. I firmly believe that if books, movies, music, magazines, or anything else is offensive, then we shouldn't have them in libraries because it's not right, and it's @CAPS2 cruel. People shouldn't be putting those things there if they are insulting to others or mean to them. In my experience, I have had that happen where I checked out a book on something and it turned out very offensive to me. It was at the @ORGANIZATION1 when I was @NUM1 years old. My parents and I were there for some movie or something, and we were looking at some books that were there. We came across a book called' @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1 '. And it was offensive to me because @CAPS5 was the religion I was raised in, and they @CAPS2 openly talked about their feelings on faith, and how they thought of it. And it made me hurt because I go to church and read the @CAPS6 - I - @CAPS6 - @CAPS8 - @CAPS9. And I was raised on a type of faith that I know a great deal about. And if you read that book, it made me question everything I believed. So to wrap up my thoughts and feelings. I think it shouldn't be there for people to read, like I said before. People have other books they can have there instead of one that are offensive to people. All in all, I hope you think about my persuasive letter, and share your thoughts and ideas too, so that we can make a better decision about what belongs in libraries.
748	3725	2	3	Hello my name is @PERSON1. One day me and a friend were in the library on @DATE1 at @TIME1, carefully looking at some books. Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school, quietly reading our books. She came up to me in the hallway. @CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it. So school went by, the bell rang, and it was time to go. When she got home, she went and told her parents. Her parents said that she should go and tell the librarian. On our walk to the library, @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink. While we were there, she got a newspaper to read about what was going on at the school. When she noticed something about books, about how they needed to be taken off the shelf. When we walked in the doors to the library, the librarian was sitting at her desk. She asked us if we needed any help. @CAPS1 said no, but I need to talk to you about a book. The librarian said she was way ahead of her. That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelves and moving them to the back closet. About a week or so later, @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library. It said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones. Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldn't do it because of one person said it was offensive, but they did it anyway. This shows that sometimes decisions are made to maintain a certain standard in the library, even if not everyone agrees.
749	3726	2	3	Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or reading disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, if strict censorship is applied, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well. Books are an essential part of life. They contain great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored are being short - sighted. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is an understandable concern, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books that are wanted to be censored would no longer be able to read those books. It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truly find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse, remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Overall, books are a good thing. They give us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them. We should respect the diversity of ideas in books and let individuals make their own choices.
750	3727	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? NO. The reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me, it might not be offensive to other people. I'm not saying things like that are offensive to me because they're not. I personally love reading books like comic books with super - heroes in them. That really excites me. Back to the point, if people think a book is offensive to them then they don't @CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what you're going to say 'but what if they didn't @CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well, that's a good question. Just put it back and don't complain because the writer didn't @CAPS1 know you were going to take it offensive or the wrong way. They were just writing a book. It's not the writer's fault. He or she was just probably writing a book that they thought was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive. DON'T @CAPS1 because they were expressing themselves. So don't take no books off the shelves in the libraries because stupid people want to get mad because they took it offensive. You're going to ruin it for the other people that thought the book was either a good book or an awesome book. So now that we got that out of the way, let's move on and get on with our lives. Thanks for the conversation. See you next time. We should all respect the freedom of expression in literature and let everyone have the chance to choose what they read.
751	3728	2	3	Society is constantly grappling with what is appropriate and what is not. On a daily basis, we encounter situations of this nature, even when we're not actively seeking them. It's a classic dispute between two parties, each trying to prove the other wrong, debating what is admissible and what isn't. We should make every effort to keep inappropriate books off our shelves and out of the hands of the young. People can be influenced to do almost anything, and there are countless such instances. What's interesting is that people can be affected indirectly, whether through television, music, or books. They can be shaped into something based on what they're conditioned to believe. The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As someone who only wishes the best for society, I'm aware that movies with criminal acts or explicit images don't help anyone become a better citizen. The same goes for books. Books with politically incorrect messages are no better than movies with similar content. I'm not against reading; in fact, I'm quite the opposite. Reading is beneficial for mental and social health as it allows us to explore aspects within ourselves that often go unused in our fast - paced world. However, if one is constantly overexposed to books that go against our human nature, they should be removed for the well - being of those around us. If someone can't find an appropriate book to read, they need to reflect on themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also have a positive influence. We, as members of the @ORGANIZATION1, are already facing enough financial troubles. We don't need to add more problems by allowing the population access to obscene books that only make people rebellious towards society. If something makes the people in our area more riotous, it should immediately be censored or removed from society. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and convey a good message simultaneously.
752	3729	2	3	Dear Newspaper; In libraries, I don't think it's necessary to remove items that some people might find offensive. After all, if it offends you, simply don't look at it. You're an individual capable of making your own decisions. If so - called offensive material isn't considered offensive by someone, then why should that person be punished because someone else makes a big deal out of it? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't. If someone finds a book offensive, don't read it. If there's a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It's that straightforward. People are intelligent enough to know what's good and what's bad for them. There's no reason why someone can't choose what they want and where they get it. From my own observations, I've seen numerous times when someone finds someone else's music offensive but doesn't say anything. They just ignore it. The world needs more people like that, more people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for their beliefs. It seems as if the world is filling up with people who care too much about what others are doing. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but everyone will be offended by something. It's your choice whether to let it bother you for the rest of your life. Listen to whatever music, read whatever books or magazines you want. If someone finds them offensive, so be it. You're your own person, and that will never change. Do what makes you happy and nothing else.
753	3730	2	3	Why censor things? There will always be someone out there who wants to read a book or magazine that others think should be censored. If this vicious cycle continues, we'll have no books left to read. There are many things that some people don't like, but that doesn't give them the right to remove them from the shelves. By taking a book off the shelf just because they think it's inappropriate, they'll leave someone with nothing to read. If books or magazines start being removed from the shelves, we'll have fewer ways to research or learn certain things. Even though there might be graphic pictures or writing in books or magazines, that doesn't make them inappropriate. They should be labeled to indicate such content. If you see the label and don't want to look, you don't have to. We need to categorize books for different ages. Then parents can be satisfied knowing that their young children can only read age - appropriate books. If parents give permission, children can read books meant for older kids or adults. Even though I'm not an avid reader, I sometimes pick up a book to learn about engines. I don't think people should be able to restrict and remove items from the shelves. Everyone has the right to read a book, watch a movie, etc. But children are different as they don't need to learn certain things at an early age. So parents can choose what their children read. However, if you're an adult, you should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever you want.
754	3731	2	3	There are many things in this world that children should not see, as they can poison the minds of children and people of all ages. The things people encounter these days can be harmful and shouldn't be witnessed by anyone, regardless of age. These things should be disposed of so that our minds and the minds of future generations remain clean. The reason I think no one of any age should be exposed to these bad things is that if kids shouldn't know about them, then there's no reason for the same kids when they grow up to be exposed to them. But if such things are in libraries, the question is, who should be in charge of deciding what's right and wrong? Since the world's population is large and people have different ideas, it's impossible for one person to go through everything and decide between good and bad. That's why it's up to the head of the family to deal with this issue and make appropriate decisions for their family members.
755	3732	2	3	I believe that some materials should not be on the shelves but not removed from the library. They should be placed in a room that contains everything that could potentially offend someone. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be completely removed from a public library. I once saw a little kid pull an adult book off the shelf. The mother was very angry at the library for having it placed so low. I understand that some books belong in the library. All adult books and related items should be placed on higher shelves so that little kids can't reach them. The library should have a room dedicated to kids and teenagers, filled with age - appropriate books, magazines, music, movies, etc. Kids shouldn't be allowed in parts of the library that are too violent or sexual. The library should also have a locked room for all adult movies and books, along with the kids' room. If the library doesn't have enough money for these rooms, they can at least put all adult items on the top or higher shelves. I believe that some materials should not be on the shelves but not removed from the library because someone might need that book to research something for school or a job. Removing it could also eliminate a part of someone's history from the library. There's a reason the book, movie, magazine, music, etc., was made. There's a reason the material exists. Also, parents can assist the library by keeping a closer eye on their kids. They should watch what their kids grab off the shelf. Parents can even ask a friend or neighbor to watch the children while they go to the library so that the kids won't see anything inappropriate. I believe everything I've written here is the truth about how things should be in a public library. Adult items should be placed higher up. If a parent doesn't like it, they can leave their kid at home or choose not to go to that library anymore.
756	3733	2	3	There are a wide variety of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library. People from all corners of the world have varying interests in different subjects. Some individuals take offence to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc., while another person may not and think it's not offensive at all. For example, a religious book that depicts @CAPS1 as one guy when some people believe differently. However, the book should not be put away because there are also books that align with your beliefs.   The extensive variety of subjects in a library, including songs, magazines, and everything else, is truly vast. There should never be a book, movie, or item removed just because one person takes offence to it. As Katherine Paterson's quote makes the point, if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf, anyone could do the same. Which would eventually leave people with no variety in books, starting a huge problem. People would not be able to read as much as they'd like since they would not have the ability to pick between many options. The library provides valuable information for teachers, students, researchers, writers, and for readers who do it as a hobby. If that was taken away from people, the people would become less informed about many things in the world.   In @CAPS2, freedom is of great importance and we expect it, including freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests. Therefore, if items were being removed from a public place that offers such freedoms, @CAPS2 would not allow this to happen. People have the right to like whatever they want. If someone takes offence to an item in the library, they should simply walk away from it and not stress about removing it. In conclusion, maintaining the diverse collection in the library is crucial to uphold the principles of freedom and ensure that everyone can access the information they desire.
757	3734	2	3	It doesn't really matter to me. We all have the right to our own likes and dislikes. Someone may not think that movies with blood in them should be allowed, but others may think that movies with adult content should not be allowed. If you don't like something and someone else does, why should you get what you want and not what someone else wants? So, if we take one movie, book, magazine, type of song, or music off the market, why don't we just take all of them off the market? Then there will be no argument about what is suitable to watch and what is not.   So, if you don't like something or have little kids and don't want them to watch something, read something, or look at something, then just don't buy them. And if you do buy them, make sure they're where the kids can't reach, find, or get to. In conclusion, respecting individual preferences and taking appropriate precautions is a more reasonable approach than trying to restrict the availability of various media.
758	3735	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because little kids shouldn't be watching, seeing, or hearing them. Violence is not a good thing for little kids to be exposed to because they will want to grow up and fight. We already have a high teen violence rate, and our teen violence rate really needs to be lowered. When teens start to fight, they often don't have control of themselves.   The movies, in my opinion, need to really be removed because that is how children are learning to fight. They see an older kid fighting in a movie and they want to try it out. Movies are a bad influence on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing. Movies could also encourage kids to be bullies. When a kid is a bully, they don't really know what they are getting themselves into. Another bad example would be drugs and alcohol. Teens and other children often get put under peer pressure. When teens and other children face peer pressure, it's hard to say NO.   The kinds of music people listen to can also be a bad influence on kids. The music that kids listen to may have something about killing, drugs, and alcohol. When kids get involved in drugs and alcohol, that will mess up their whole life. For example, the screamo music, to me, sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone.   Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading. Magazines have bad images in them and when teens see the images, they want to act and or be just like the people that are in those pictures.   Books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves because of all the violence. There are so many different fights and different teens that get other kids into peer pressure. That is why I'm persuading you to take the books off the shelves. In conclusion, protecting children from the negative influences in various media is essential for their healthy development and to reduce the rates of violence and other harmful behaviors among them.
759	3736	2	3	How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, @CAPS1 citizens may take what these items say more offensively than what it may seem. They may seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across @LOCATION1, but is it really true?   Due to all the different races that @LOCATION1 sees every single day, sometimes we may @CAPS2 be doing our best to accept their different cultural backgrounds in our modern - day society. I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all - white school how most people judge other races other than their own, whether it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc. Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way. Taking this all into consideration, I think that whether or not they are racial books, magazines, or movies, they should @CAPS2 be removed from their distribution around the world.   I know that whether or not these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial, they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it. I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc. It's a part of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and I enjoy learning about it very much. It may seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through may just seem like a joke towards them, to make fun of all they went through, even though it is @CAPS2 meant that way at all. I also understand that there are people who write books about Mexican jokes, black jokes, etc., or even make comedy movies joking over different races. These types of things I think should be taken OFF the shelves everywhere! These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural background.   When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on. I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on different races, unless it is purposely made for the reason of making fun of people. I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural background. The magazines I read about, like Seventeen magazine, seem to comment about how beautiful these people are.   Overall, I think that making fun of different races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better. Even though all these different items such as movies, magazines, books, and music may seem racial, I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the @CAPS4 of our world. But if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a different race, that should definitely be removed from every shelf around the world. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects both the educational value of certain content and the need to protect against racial harm is necessary for a more inclusive and understanding society.
760	3737	2	3	Should books that are offensive be removed from library shelves? Some books in the library are offensive to some people. But should the books be removed from the shelves? I personally don't think the books should be removed. Some people may think the books do need to be removed, while some don't. What is your choice to this difficult question?   First off, as I said before, I don't think the books should be removed, but some people may not like my opinion. These books should not be removed just because they are offensive to other people. If another person finds any book offensive, that person should just ignore the book, not ask for it to be taken off the shelf. Someone else might want to read that same book, but if it is taken off the shelf, then that person can't read the book. It isn't fair to take books off the shelf just because someone finds the book offensive. Any person that finds a book offensive should just ignore it and not read the book. That book that is offensive to someone isn't directed at him or her; the author's opinion shouldn't matter.   Second, everyone's opinion is different. Some people want the books off the shelves, while some people don't. So who gets their way in this little argument? I think the books should stay on the shelves. One person may find the book offensive and the next person may not. Other people may not even read the offensive book. But no matter if the book is read or not, it shouldn't be taken off the shelf; it just isn't fair to all the other people who actually do want to read that book.   Lastly, everyone enjoys different book themes. If you don't like the theme of the book, then why are you reading it? If you don't like the book or you find it offensive, go choose another book. Don't make it so that other people can't read the book if they like those kinds of themes. You wouldn't like it if that happened to you. No one would like that. Just pick a book that has a theme you like.   In conclusion, it's clear that removing offensive books from library shelves is an unfair practice. People have diverse opinions and preferences, and taking away a book just because one person finds it offensive deprives others of the opportunity to explore different ideas. Maintaining the variety of books in the library ensures that everyone can access the literature they enjoy and learn from a wide range of perspectives.
761	3738	2	3	Have you ever read a book you thought was offensive? Have you ever read a book you didn't want anyone else to read? I wholeheartedly agree with Katherine Paterson. If we can take one book off the shelves, we can take all the books off the shelf. Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor, it means that if one person takes a book off the shelf, then so does everyone else. Eventually, we will have no books to read at libraries. This is precisely why I stand with Katherine on this subject. Books are written for us to read, not to be censored just because some uptight parent doesn't want their kid reading a book that so many other people enjoy.   Magazines that people think are offensive should be placed in a different area so that kids can't access them. The same goes for movies. Some movies are not meant for kids, but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf! One practical thing we can do is put the vulgar movies that we don't want our children watching behind the counter and have the librarian retrieve them when we wish to watch them.   As for books, we can create a separate section of the library for books that kids shouldn't read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, and some action books. Music is another area where some parents have a hard time due to the offensive lyrics in them. However, some people like that kind of music, so we can't take that away from them just because we don't like it. Does that seem fair?   Now, do some of those books seem a bit more reasonable? Yes, we still don't want our kids reading vulgar books about killing, romance, and serial killers, but some people enjoy reading those novels. This is why I firmly side with Katherine @PERSON1. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse reading preferences of individuals and avoid over - zealous censorship in libraries.
762	3739	2	3	Libraries in @LOCATION1. I am going to write a persuasive essay about my thoughts on some books and magazines that some people find offensive content in. I strongly believe that just because something is offensive to someone, it shouldn't be taken off the shelf, as different people have different views on a book or magazine. So, I'm going to share what I think about this subject.  I think if someone doesn't like what's in a book, they should simply choose not to read it. After all, some people might find it really interesting. People need to stop being so self - centered and start considering others. For example, the author of the book or magazine may have somehow related to it, and they probably created it so that other people could also relate. That's why I think people should stop arguing about taking books off the shelf and start thinking about the feelings and interests of others. That's my stance on people trying to take books off the shelf.  So, whoever is reading this, please take this into consideration and realize that some people like different books than others. Don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of reading materials in libraries and not let a few negative opinions lead to unnecessary censorship.
763	3740	2	3	"In Libraries, there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that @MONTH1 be found offensive to many, but they might be exactly what some people like to read or consume; therefore, we must keep all of the materials, no matter how crude they may seem. These library materials are all integral parts of the world's past, and each one has a deeper story behind it, which in turn has an even more profound story, and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one, then we are going to be left with nothing to learn from. The world will become less intelligent, and we will start to forget and lose our past. This is the primary reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magazines off the shelves of a library, for they @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others, but in the end, they all contain some part of the past that no other book @MONTH1 contain.  A world with no so - called inappropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place, but it will be depriving people of knowledge that @MONTH1 be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelf, then none would be left. The books would gradually lose their essence, their love, compassion, and liveliness. Other books @MONTH1 contain references to segregation, and segregation is a significant part of America's past. The word ""negroe"" is offensive to some, and if we took all of the books with this word out, then we would lose @NUM1 years of America's past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, and the rise and fall of many empires and kingdoms would all disappear because the violence was too offensive. Many historic moments in the world's history would be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of preserving the world's past.  The world would lose an enormous amount of history by getting rid of offensive books. If the books were placed in their own section in the library, then kids would not be able to access them, thus eliminating the problem for young eyes. If you find many books offensive, then you should probably just avoid going to a library because no matter what, no books are going to be simply discarded as they hold valuable history within them. If we start deshelving books, then soon movies will follow, and magazines will be limited in their content. I believe that if our kids cannot access the section with offensive books, then we won't have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to get rid of offensive books, then we should create a section where offensive books are stored and kids cannot reach. In @CAPS1, this is a practical way to handle the issue of censoring books in libraries. In conclusion, we must protect the historical value of library materials and use smart strategies instead of outright censorship."
764	3741	2	3	Censorship in Libraries. I think that a certain degree of censorship in a library is understandable as some people @MONTH1 feel that children shouldn't be exposed to certain things. And it's true that there are a lot of things that even adults might not want to see. If there are inappropriate materials in the library, the library owners could create a separate section for them.   People should have the right to access any materials they want in the library. However, this doesn't mean that we should completely ignore the fact that some content may not be suitable for everyone. By having a dedicated section for potentially offensive materials, we can strike a balance between the freedom of access and the protection of vulnerable readers, especially children. In conclusion, a well - thought - out approach to library censorship can ensure that both the rights of readers and the well - being of the community are respected.
765	3742	2	3	Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose. This is a fundamental right that should remain in the hands of the reader, not be controlled by the library. Every person has the freedom to read about whatever topics they are interested in, and those working at libraries should not influence which books people read.  Censorship of books is completely unnecessary. If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the undeniable right to do so. Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is a personal choice; nobody forces them to read it. When a reader comes across a book that is offensive, they can make the decision not to read it. Just because one reader finds a book offensive doesn't mean another person would, and this other person has the right to read the book if they choose.  Finding a book offensive is merely an opinion, lacking any factual basis. So, who has the authority to say whether a book is offensive or not? Just because someone running a library believes a book to be offensive or inappropriate, it doesn't mean the book should be removed from the shelf. There is no single person who can objectively determine whether a book is offensive.  Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, although some of them are already subject to certain regulations. Movies, for example, are all rated, which gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch. The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects. By choosing a higher - rated movie, the viewer is making their own decision about what they see, and librarians should not take it upon themselves to remove these films. It is not their responsibility.  Music is also rated, and if necessary, has a parental warning label, indicating that the album has explicit content. Just like with movies or books, everyone has the right to listen to whichever music they like, and should not have to search elsewhere because the librarian thought the music was inappropriate.  Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this doesn't mean the library should make the decision to rate them and get rid of the ones considered 'offensive'. As repeatedly mentioned, it is the reader's choice to view material, not the librarian's.  Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they want, without the interference of librarians. Each person has the freedom to decide what material they consume, and no one else has the right to tell them otherwise. In conclusion, we should uphold the principle of freedom of choice in libraries and resist unnecessary censorship.
766	3743	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that there should be absolutely no form of censorship. Every individual has the inherent right to read or watch whatever brings them joy. Just because a particular piece of content might offend someone, it doesn't justify its non - existence. For instance, if books and movies are removed from the shelves for the sake of censorship, it would surely offend the very people who created them, the authors and filmmakers.   There are numerous reasons why censorship doesn't belong in libraries. First and foremost is the fundamental principle of freedom of speech. People should be able to say or write whatever they genuinely believe in. Just because a work can potentially offend some doesn't mean we should take away the opportunity for those who aren't offended to read it. We must give people the full right to read and write as they wish.   Moreover, implementing censorship will have a detrimental impact on literature. When we censor, we have to take the books that might offend people off the shelves. Once these books are removed, no one can read them. And if no one reads the books, no one can learn from them.   Another aspect to consider is the authors' livelihood. Often, when I see a book I like in the library, I'll go and buy it. But if these books are taken off the shelves, no one will even see them. Authors write books to make a point and earn a living. If we remove the books, they won't make money, and their intended message won't reach the audience.   In conclusion, I think censorship is a thoroughly bad idea. It violates the principle of freedom of speech, can severely harm literature, and takes away the authors' income and the chance to share their perspectives. These are the compelling reasons why I do not support censorship.
767	3744	2	3	I don't think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf. The reason is that if some people don't like a particular piece of content, there are others who might find it highly entertaining. For example, a certain type of music that one person dislikes could be the favorite of another. I believe that if parents don't want their children to see or hear certain things, they should take the responsibility of restricting their access.   Children should have the right to know about some aspects of the world, but not everything. After all, everyone has the right to be aware of what is going on or what happened in the past. History and current events are out there to be seen, not hidden from people. Even if some might misinterpret the information, it's important for the knowledge to be accessible.   I would prefer my children to know about various things so that they can distinguish between right and wrong. There is indeed some content in books, magazines, and other media that might not be suitable, but people consume such materials all the time. Schools teach children about a wide range of topics, including some that might be considered sensitive. Does that mean schools should be shut down? Certainly not!   Some people choose to homeschool their kids for this reason, but they often don't think about what their children will encounter in public. There is really no valid reason for people to be overly offended by what they read or listen to.   There's no point in taking content off the shelf just because some people don't like it. Other people will enjoy it and might even buy it. People need to understand that there is inappropriate content everywhere, and children will likely come across it at some point. That's just the nature of our modern economy. In summary, we should respect the diversity of opinions and choices when it comes to media content, and only step in when the content is truly harmful.
768	3745	2	3	Yes! I whole - heartedly believe that books, music, and magazines are extremely valuable. Books, for example, are filled with a vast amount of information. They can take us to different worlds and teach us about various subjects. When I listen to music, it makes me feel so sweet. I mean, it fills me with so much happiness. For instance, when I first started listening to American music, I felt kind of crazy because it was so different from what I was used to. But as I kept listening, I learned to understand the meaning behind the songs.   Magazines are also great for reading. When I first came to America, I felt so sad because I didn't know anyone and I didn't know how to read magazines. But then, after two months, I made new friends. They taught me how to speak English and how to read magazines. A few years later, I had made a lot of friends in school. My teacher told me not to worry about learning to speak English. She said that if I came to school every day, I would be able to speak it very well. So, I studied every day to learn to speak English. Now, I can speak English very well at school. I love all my teachers because they taught me how to speak English. In conclusion, these forms of media have played a crucial role in my personal growth and learning.
769	3746	2	3	In the current life we lead, there is an increasing need to make things more private. When something is said that we don't like, we often feel the urge to shield others from it. In modern writing and throughout history, there have been certain books that we find morally objectionable because they go against our beliefs. But just because a group of people claim a book is wrong, is there a real need to completely remove it from circulation?   No. Every written work has a purpose. If there was no purpose, we wouldn't have anything to read in the first place. It's true that some books and magazines can be very vivid and unsuitable for younger minds. However, that's precisely why these materials are intended for older readers.   I'm a big fan of books related to the two World Wars. I find them incredibly fascinating and enjoy imagining what my life could have been like if the outcomes of those wars had been different. I'll admit that many of these books contain content that is so real that even some adults can't handle it. But that's no reason to get rid of them entirely. These books represent a significant part of human history that many people need to know. Without them, the World Wars could become just a distant memory.   There are also many books with very mature themes, such as detailed sex scenes. These books are definitely unsuitable for younger kids. But they were never created for them. They were made for older, more mature readers. If we're concerned about what our children are reading, parents should step in and control the intensity and maturity level of the books their children access.   While looking out for what our children see is important, we also need to consider that people can get ideas from reading intense books. For example, if someone reads a book about politics and discovers a new perspective, they might be motivated to spread that idea. This could lead to a large - scale reaction, even against the government. But if we're a free society, we should tolerate different thoughts and outlooks.   Overall, putting restrictions on what we read or see is morally wrong for our country. Limiting our nation's access to information would likely cause more of an uproar than dealing with different viewpoints. People would see it as the government trying to control our knowledge, which goes against the principles of a free society.
770	3747	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should generally not be removed from the library shelves. People have different tastes, and what one person finds offensive, another might enjoy. However, if the materials propose things like racism, I would strongly advocate for their removal from the shelves.   First, people have the option to choose whether to look at offensive materials. We all have our own opinions about what is offensive and what is not. Many people have families and children, and they don't want their kids to be exposed to inappropriate content. Parents usually know where most of the materials in libraries are located. If they're concerned, they can take their children to a different library or a store that sells more censored books.   My only exception is when the content in a book, music, movie, or magazine is racist in any way. Racist content has no place in public spaces like libraries. It can cause harm and promote negative and discriminatory ideas.   Many people can decide whether or not to visit a place with offensive materials. Sometimes, the local, state, or federal government gets involved in deciding whether such material can be put on library shelves or the internet. There might be people who like these kinds of books, music, etc., and don't want them removed. Even though searching for offensive content on the internet might seem a bit crazy, it's still their choice.   In conclusion, while I generally oppose excessive censorship in libraries, I firmly believe that racist content should be removed. We should respect people's choices and freedom to access different types of media, but also ensure that our public spaces are free from harmful and discriminatory materials.
771	3748	2	3	Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive? YES! Children shouldn't be exposed to certain inappropriate things. Some books and magazines are too explicit for children at certain ages. For example, books with excessive violence or sexual content are not suitable for young kids. Children should read books that meet their age group, like age - appropriate picture books for toddlers and simple novels for elementary - school children. If children read books that are inappropriate for their age, they might start to act out that way, imitating the bad behaviors they've read about. Parents should try and remove all books that are offensive to their children because that can have a really bad effect on them, such as causing nightmares or changing their values. Children at a certain age group should read books that are on their level and appropriate for them.  Certain books, magazines, music, and movies are too explicit for kids these days. I think they should all be blocked and out of children's reach. If children start to listen to inappropriate music and read offensive books, it might affect the way they act, making them more rebellious or disrespectful. Children shouldn't be exposed to things that might brainwash them. If kids start to read horrible books and listen to bad music, imagine what effect it might have on them in the world we live in today!  I think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children. Parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inappropriate things off the shelves for kids. Parents should want to keep kids far away from certain things that appear offensive. It will mean that they're doing their job as a good parent.  Sometimes kids won't always agree with what the parent might say, but they have to realize it could be what's best for them. Parents shouldn't always want to be their child's friend because, sometimes kids would take advantage of you. I know from personal experience because sometimes people can take kindness for weakness! Being a parent, you should already be prepared for things like this.  In conclusion, explicit magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids. It might expose children to things that aren't always good for them, and protecting children's well - being should be a top priority for parents and society.
772	3749	2	3	If I had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because everybody has a right to read, listen and see whatever they want. After all, people have different interests and preferences. If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else, why would they be looking at it in the first place? Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books because it would affect their children. However, removing such books would cause a change in kids' education, as they would miss out on different perspectives.  Everybody has the right to read whatever they want. There are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things. For instance, some people enjoy historical novels with controversial themes, while others like science - fiction with strange concepts. If books would have to be removed from the library, then everybody would start taking all the books out based on their own standards. One way or another, everybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lives anyways.  The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibit them from doing it. In my opinion, I think that if parents took the time to explain to their kids the good and bad things about life, it wouldn't be that offensive for their children. For example, parents can have discussions with their kids about the values in a book.  Another reason why I wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids. Removing books means taking away history from them. There are many painters in our history that painted naked women; many people find that offensive. But I think they should never take that history from them because they are just learning things about their history, like the art styles and cultural backgrounds of different eras.  Books, music, magazines, etc. should not be removed from libraries. Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not. Removing these items would just be a total chaos. They should leave the libraries just the way they are. Everybody has the right to read, listen and see whatever they want, and this freedom is essential for a diverse and informed society.
773	3750	2	3	Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.  Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For example, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I - pod, take it from them. It is not a right to have the device; it is a privilege and parents are allowed to take away privileges. Parents should also have conversations with their children about what is appropriate and what is not.  In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. For example, some adult - themed TV shows attract a large audience due to their edgy content. If you censor all of that material out, less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of, it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current opportunities for profit.  Both of these points are valid, but most importantly, censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble, we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand amendments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that? Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers. It would be an administrative nightmare.  In brief, censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively affecting all of these areas, the consequences are much more influential than the benefits. Obviously, censoring is not the answer to offensive material, as it goes against the principles of freedom and personal responsibility.
774	3751	2	3	"Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility. You are in a world of endless possibilities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section. You think to yourself how unnecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind. In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect.  Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals. This censorship is not just narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well. Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library. I do not think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of the violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there. For example, a sign could be placed at the entrance of the section saying ""Adult - themed content"".  Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge. Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life. This includes children and families. Children do not need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries. I do not think the books should be removed from the shelves, but put somewhere else where a child could not easily find it. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to. Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that. This shows that it is not good for a child to see such offensive things. Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can not stumble upon it, is the best choice.  Another reason that I believe that the books should not be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject. Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts. Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone. I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that. Although, people who do not want to see that should also have the choice to not come across it. This is why the books should not be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section.  In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to not remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or not to see certain material they might find offensive. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment for all those who wish to access and use it, respecting both individual rights and the well - being of all users."
775	3752	2	3	"No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that people have the right to read what they want and so do authors have the right to write what they want. One of the principles of democratic statements is freedom of speech, giving people the right to say and write what they want. After all, freedom of speech is a fundamental right in a democratic society.  People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start to take those things away, then what use would there be for a library? If everything is taken out, then nobody would have any reason for going to a library. Libraries are a place where people can explore different ideas and knowledge.  This brings up the concept of democracy. ""Freedom of speech"" means that people have the right to write what they want to. If others find it offensive, then don't read it. Also, freedom of expression lets people do this too. If people wish to express themselves by reading it, then they have that right. For example, an author might write a controversial book to express a new perspective.  One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it. He found these bands I had never heard and I really liked them. If someone found them ""offensive"", I would have never got to hear how good they were. This shows that limiting access to materials in the library can prevent people from discovering new and interesting things.  This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries. Not only does it deny others of something they could love, but it also destroys history. Libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information. It would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderful pieces of work that someone worked really hard on to create. Preserving the diversity of materials in libraries is essential for the progress of knowledge and the freedom of individuals."
776	3753	2	3	In libraries, there is a diverse collection of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials available for the general public to check out. This topic of censorship in libraries is a difficult one because everyone holds different views on various aspects of life. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from the shelves just because they are found offensive by someone. When one is in a library, there are numerous choices to browse and borrow. Suppose someone comes across a book or a movie that seems offensive to them. That person should simply look elsewhere because a library serves the general public. It might seem harsh, but it is not up to that individual to decide whether the material should remain in the library. The materials that are offensive to some people could be placed in a special section in the library to accommodate everyone. Libraries have the right to censor any type of material that appears or is offensive to the community. This is justifiable if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries. However, if the whole community disagrees with a library about a certain material, then the community has a say in it. Yes, there are books in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean removing that material from the library. Our country, @LOCATION1, states that everyone has the right to free speech. @LOCATION1 has banned books that are offensive to @CAPS1, but other countries around the @LOCATION2 might have those books in their libraries. There is a fine line in determining whether a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not. One person should not have the sole right to decide if a book is offensive. But if the whole community deems a book offensive, then yes. The libraries and the community have the option to not have an offensive book on the shelf. If it is offensive to everyone, then it should be removed. Censorship is a difficult topic to argue about, but we need to balance individual sensitivities with the rights of the broader public.
777	3754	2	3	No, I don't think you should be able to take the magazines off the shelf because it is pointless. To some people, @MONTH1, everything seems offensive, while others, @MONTH1, do not find it offensive. For me personally, the stuff people find offensive I often find kind of humorous. I understand that some people are more likely to be offended due to factors like their sexuality or ethnicity. But other than that, there should be no censorship as it makes the place implementing it seem overly strict. Because of those strict policies, it makes some people less likely to visit that place to get what they want. And who knows, the thing you @MONTH1 want @MONTH1 be censored. I also understand that when you have a kid, you don't want them to do the wrong things in life and try to keep them away from the bad stuff for as long as possible. However, as your child grows older, they will be introduced to older/adult - type material. You should give them some leeway and not punish them severely when something like that happens. From my humble opinion, some parents are very strict about censorship, and I completely understand the parents' point of view. Eventually, people will have to let their children find out about certain things. So, you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of @NUM1 or so, which seems like a suitable age for early privileges. When it comes to taking items off a shelf, some people have worse judgment than others, and that can affect everyone due to their bad judgment. In conclusion, while we should be cautious about what children are exposed to, complete censorship is not the answer as it restricts freedom and individual choice.
778	3755	2	3	Imagine a beautiful, sunny day. You're sitting outside under a large, shady tree, comfortably reading one of your favorite books. You can feel the gentle wind playing with your hair and are fully immersed in all that is happening in the story. You not only read at home but also at school. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would be to prevent everyone from reading that book just because of one person. This is something I simply cannot imagine. At my school, teachers and other faculty members are always encouraging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are constantly busy participating in after - school events such as band, playing a sport, theater, choir, etc. Not many teens are able to find the time to be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when I heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decision. Kids should be able to read what they want to read. As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others @MONTH1 do not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This also applies to reading. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novels. Some novels, more than others, have a lot more graphic content such as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 has a lot of fighting in it. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all @CAPS1 movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the @CAPS3 series. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent these movies? I do not think so. Another reason I do not think that we should take out books and magazines in our libraries is that not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, @ORGANIZATION2. Personally in my family, me and my brother have believed in @LOCATION1 for many years. My cousins, however, do not teach their children about @ORGANIZATION2. If I brought over @ORGANIZATION1 and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of @ORGANIZATION1? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about @ORGANIZATION2 does not mean that everyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about @ORGANIZATION2. So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it is offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken off the shelves because kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book is offensive, and lastly, because if we got rid of all the offensive books, what books would be left to read? In the end, a balance must be struck between individual sensitivities and the right of all to access diverse reading materials.
779	3756	2	3	There are many books, various types of music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive to people. Should they be removed? It depends. If something is extremely inappropriate or offensive, then it should be removed. Today, there are many books that convey bad messages. When I see one, I just try to ignore it. I don't pick it up, read the back, or take it home to read. I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read. But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place. I think the area where the most offensive things are present is movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes, such as bad language and scary scenes. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated @NUM1 and is extremely scary. I cannot imagine watching this movie as a middle - schooler. I watched it as a sophomore and was really scared. I never would have thought it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden, and the child may not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No. Another area that is concerning is video games. There are kids who play them so excessively that all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think about these things so much that they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and can hurt people mentally and even emotionally. You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there, anyone is going to look. Different genres of music @MONTH1 even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad in themselves. These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get what we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others believe it is okay to watch, listen to, and read these kinds of things. However, the things we read, watch, and listen to on a regular basis influence our thoughts. If we fill our minds with bad things, that's all we'll start to think about, and it will become a part of our lives. In conclusion, while we can't completely eliminate offensive content, we should be more aware of its impact and strive for better self - regulation.
780	3757	2	3	I believe that people have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive. The reason why I say this is because if one person finds it offensive, it doesn't mean that another person might think the same. If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational purposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and go back to school to understand this stuff better. Just because some people think that a book with vulgar language is offensive, they need to know that more than half of the world's books have profanity in them. And just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed from the shelves in the library. I have had my own encounters with books that I thought were offensive. There was a book that I was reading in my freshman year of high school. In it, there were people who were part of the @PERSON2, and they were having meetings. One guy said that he hated negros and that he had picked one for tonight and they were going to lynch them with the noose they had made the night before. That really hurt me because I have someone in my family that is black. To think about someone doing that to him would just break my heart, and I would probably go out and find the people that did it and kill them. In the quote written by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book, then we do too. And if we do so, then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf. This is a great way to say that almost every book we have has something vulgar in them. If we were to take them all away, then there would be none left. If there was the possibility of all the books being taken away from us, then there would be a huge uprising, and everything would start going downhill from there. Because there are people that can't go a day without reading a part of their book, and some people have devoted three hours to reading once a day. What I'm trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have vulgar language or something offensive in them. Because if we tried to do that, then we would be taking every book away in the world, and then no one would be learning anything. In conclusion, while offensive content can be uncomfortable, removing all such books would severely limit our access to knowledge and cultural heritage.
781	3758	2	3	The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive? In my honest opinion, I truly don't think they should censor the material. Some things that we read, see, and hear in our daily lives are just going to be offensive, and it's simply impossible for us to control everything that offends us. I do whole - heartedly agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over every single aspect. People really need to stop over - reacting to something that might have been said a long time ago. Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there. For example, some African Americans are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a hundred years ago. Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our past. We need to stop all this over - protection, especially in our libraries. Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future. Why? Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries. Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons? My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone. I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I don't try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it. Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you don't like or don't agree with. Life is full of such situations, and we should learn to accept and move on.
782	3759	2	3	In my opinion, I firmly believe that if the only purpose of an item is to be read, then it should definitely be in a library. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies should be one hundred percent accessible through a library. This is mainly because many people can learn many different things in many different ways. For instance, there are visual learners, which are people who learn better by looking and carefully observing the topic. Then there are the listeners, who are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves. And lastly, the readers, who can do all of the above and read with ease. I know not all people are literate, but maybe visiting a library once in a while would help them improve their reading skills. However, in order for that to happen, that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens have to work their way up to being able to read. I hope people can understand through my point of view. All I'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities, but some people haven't gotten to the reading stage yet. Why not start learning in a nice, calm, relaxing township library? It provides the perfect environment for self - improvement and learning.
783	3760	2	3	There are so many reasons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong. If it is extremely violent or overly sexual, I can understand why it shouldn't be on the shelves. But if the reader doesn't like the book or movie, then don't read it or watch it; just find something else. If everyone took a book off the shelf that they didn't like, then what would we have to read? Because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive. Every book can't be perfect for that person. Everyone has their own views on books, whether they like it or dislike it. If that book isn't what you're looking for, then put it back and stop reading it. There have been many people say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it'. They are exactly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway, that's going to make you mad. Then you're going to complain that it is on the shelves and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore. That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive. People know what they like and don't like, so if there is something that you don't like, then don't listen to it or read it. It all comes down to common sense. We all have it; we just need to start using it. That means if you like country music, then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like, so don't listen to it. Because if you listen to it, then you'll be like, 'Why is that stuff on the shelves for people to listen to? It's bad for you; it is putting bad thoughts into those teenagers' heads.' If everyone sticks to doing what they like and doesn't worry about the other stuff, then everyone will be fine and the library can maintain a diverse collection.
784	3761	2	3	History is bound to repeat itself, right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future society. By censoring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking up everything they see or hear. The effects of what the future may bring are far worse than making it so an adult must reach a little higher for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assassinations, and religious protests of the past. The organization prides itself on the fact that children are the future. Well, why not put in the effort to prevent them from seeing what they shouldn't see or read? I wish that when I was younger, many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregnancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't. There was a thirteen - year - old girl in my class who got pregnant. She thought it was cool because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers; it was her mother's and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and the girl read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. The girl said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made - up story her mother checked out at a library. This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school and not worry about the book that they might grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place. Well, my brother is too. But, my point is they shouldn't have to live up to the expectations of others or the 'what's cool'. By censoring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make decisions that could affect the rest of their lives. Just like how a popular band has a new song out. The lyrics are inappropriate for many young children, but you can look it up on youtube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them. Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censoring, we might accomplish something no one else has. To show the world our youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take pride in making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true. If we have more students reading stuff such as, 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' and enjoy them, it would show that their dreams can come true, whether it's fiction or non - fiction. It doesn't always matter as long as you're reading something that isn't stopping your mind from growing and developing fully. Many of the young women in my sophomore class have read, 'the Twilight series,' and they loved it, which made them read other vampire books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrities who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people, teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth, more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have a say in whether or not the future is good or bad. Why not make the choice easier by eliminating the ones we wouldn't choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines, about a celebrity who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for your life? In my personal opinion, I believe children and adults should have separate television shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons, as well as more, to why censoring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five - year - old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life or school, to go and learn what you already know.
785	3762	2	3	I think censorship should be allowed in the libraries because many people have different opinions of what type of books they like and should read. I don't think people should remove books or any type of materials just because of their dislike. Many people think by looking at different types of materials can have you look for the right information. I feel that if you limit the books in libraries, that would mean there are fewer resources to help out with the information that you are trying to receive. Many people find it hard if the information they want is not there in the local libraries. Libraries should be a place where people can find all the books, music, movies, and magazines they want and need. Books should never be taken off the shelf but only should be allowed more on the shelves for any information that is needed. A library is supposed to be a treasure trove of knowledge, and limiting its collection goes against its very purpose. We should respect the diverse interests and needs of all library users and ensure that the library remains a place of open access and learning.
786	3763	2	3	Books and movies are a wonderful way for many people to engage and exercise their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves in @MONTH1 can have a notably negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some overly - cautious people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and personal experience, I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves.  First, I often watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves, and maybe some of those books aren't the best for them. I believe from closely watching them that it helps them grow. Being a young kid, you're naturally curious, and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly, if it's really that bad to you, they won't remember it the next day. Personally, I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again and help them learn right from wrong.  Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery and war, and it just makes me want to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong.  Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone. We older and more wise adults need to realize that it's not all bad; yes, bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer, and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this.  All in all, I understand the idea of removing some books, magazines, and movies, but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them.
787	3764	2	3	In this article, I am going to talk in detail about the way libraries censor their books. I am going to hit key points on what I personally think about the subject. But also, I'll give the point of view I hold regarding the books that are on these shelves. Additionally, I'll discuss how libraries should handle this matter by pre - censoring the books on the shelves. I will try to give clear details on why a book does not need to be taken off the shelf or if it has to be.  I think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer and more vigilant eye on what the readers, especially the younger ones, are reading. But this issue can be addressed by just looking at the book reviews and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read. This can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to inappropriate material while they are reading. Some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature - type book. But you just can't forget about those books; you have to carefully watch what they are reading.  Some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme. If you take a book off the shelf, what is the older person going to read? You just can't do this because what if another person wants that book and they can't have it. But what you can do is make a special section for those types of books so that young children will not easily access those books. This, I think, can help with the problem.  I feel that they could also pre - censor these books. This will help explain things in a way that younger readers can understand it. Plus, it can improve the way people feel about those books. Moreover, they could print two copies: one for a more mature audience and one for a younger one. If they do this, it would make an improvement so younger kids can take this information like a mature person does and say this is not real life.  In conclusion, I feel like I am neutral about the subject. I think it is a bad thing to have inappropriate books on the shelf in a library. But I feel it can be prevented in the way libraries manage it. Just keep a closer eye on the younger audience. Also, try to pre - censor them to make them more friendly to the younger audience.
788	3765	2	3	Censorship in Libraries The library presents to the community a wide array of different things for entertainment. There's a large variety of entertainment such as: romantic movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and many others. Yet, there are some that have inappropriate content. I believe that any of the things in the libraries that have inappropriate things in them should be censored or removed from the public view. If this is done, it will benefit our children's moral beliefs, the library's family - friendly image, and save money for better things.  Our children are the most precious things to us. They are the future of our country and our world. They are the people who will be leading our country in the years to come. We teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs. Yet, if they start seeing or reading inappropriate things that they can find at a library, then their moral views will gradually change. They will think that the things they see are okay in society because it's in a library, which is supposed to be a place of learning and good values.  If the library, which is thought to be one of the most educational places, has bad or inappropriate things, then the image of the library will be perceived as bad and dirty as well. The library needs to censor the bad things to allow its self - image to look good. Many parents won't want to take their children to the library if they know that there can be a magazine of death and murder laying out on the shelves.  The library would also save a lot of money if they censored the things they have. Many of the pornographic things they have cost a significant amount of money. Usually, if they buy movies that aren't censored, it costs extra. If they buy things that are appropriate, they would benefit greatly. They could use that money and buy better books at a lower price.  The library is a very important part of one's community. We need them in our lives and our children's lives also, but we won't take our children if we know that the things there aren't good for them. That's why the library needs to censor the inappropriate things so that the parents feel safe when going to the library. The library is a fun place to go, and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad.
789	3766	2	3	Certain books, magazines, or even music contains mature or graphic content. The music will always have ratings, just like movies. They don't need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school library. Most language arts materials are sorted through out the library in an orderly and well - organized fashion, so the younger children will only be able to purchase books at their age level or the type of art of their choice.  Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. A child should never purchase a mature - level book. Books, movies, and music are all similar in this regard. They are made for certain types of audiences. If a movie is rated @CAPS1, then it is made for an eighteen - or - older audience. They are situated throughout the library in a way that is suitable for children, adults, and teens. The children just need to stay within their own age levels.  If there is a mature or graphic book in a children's library, then that should cause conflict. Any parent would agree with that statement. The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries. Public libraries that are divided into sections to connect with all age groups, ensuring that each age group can access appropriate materials.
790	3767	2	3	Keep or Remove? Every year, more and more books of significance to literature are being taken off of the shelves in our local libraries and classrooms. And although these books @MONTH1 contain some writing that is offensive now, they still have had a profound impact on shaping the @CAPS1 culture today. Along with books, many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material. Just because some of these materials @MONTH1 contain offensive content, does not give people the right to make them out of reach and deprive the public of what they enjoy.  So is it right to remove offensive material from libraries? Absolutely not. Many people enjoy books, magazines, and movies of this nature. In reality, it is more than likely hurting the library's business more than anything because these types of materials are what @CAPS1 culture is all about. People don't want to read about what's happening at the animal shelter across the street. They want to read about what's going on in @LOCATION1 and about the hottest trends for seasons. All in all, removing these materials will only hurt the library's popularity and the number of customers they attract.  Artists write about what they love and how they feel. How can someone tell an author of a book that his or her writing is too graphic or too offensive? That is what he or she chose to write about! That is how he or she expresses themselves through their writing! By 'frowning upon' books, magazines, or songs with certain offensive content, officials diminish the creativity and uniqueness of authors. If a certain author or artist has a really great, original idea for a new song or book but is worried about it not being carried by libraries because it is a little offensive, then obviously that author or artist is not going to write that book or song. By removing offensive books, songs, and movies, we the public are being robbed of creative and imaginative writing.  All in all, the removal of offensive books, magazines, movies, and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves. Generations @MONTH1 may never even hear of 'The @CAPS2 of @PERSON1' just because it uses racial terms. So what would you do if put in this situation? Keep or remove? In the end, we should strive to keep these materials accessible while also being mindful of the needs of different audiences, perhaps by implementing proper age - restriction policies rather than an outright ban.
791	3768	2	3	In this persuasion essay, it will thoroughly discuss the matter of whether we should or shouldn't remove all offensive books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelf. In this essay, everyone will either whole - heartedly agree with the content or firmly stand on the opposing side of the argument. It's not an unusual situation that this essay will not resonate with some of the viewing audience; however, there are indeed circumstances where the audience can see the merits of both sides. To begin with, regarding the case of whether we should remove offensive books, music, magazines, or movies from the library, I firmly don't believe that all content should be removed from public view. There are, of course, some exceptional cases, but banning all such material doesn't seem logical. In my opinion, the complete removal of materials appears a bit extreme; instead, placing the content on a higher - access shelf seems a more practical approach rather than getting rid of it permanently. Yes, the content might be offensive, but in this modern time period, offensive movies, books, magazines, etc., are often regarded as more comical and not taken seriously. For example, a highly offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is extremely offensive, yet people simply view it as entertaining. This show can potentially offend everyone, but we still watch it. In this show, there is a clear warning label stating that it is only suitable for children @NUM1 and older. Parents are advised and should be well - aware of what their kids are watching. It's not the responsibility of the content creator to be banned; rather, it is the job of parents to be cautious about what their kids are reading, watching, looking at, or listening to. In this regard, there isn't a one - size - fits - all right answer to this subject. However, the creators of the content see it as a way to express their life experiences, the challenges they've faced, or simply to make people laugh. They view it as a safe outlet for self - expression. It might be offensive to you, but for some people, that's their reality. You might not like it or find it harsh, but that's real life. Secondly, there will always be something that might offend you, but it doesn't make sense to ban it. Take religion as an example. A particular religion a person follows might offend you. But it doesn't mean that if a religion is offensive to someone, it will be banned or removed for everyone. Your own religion might offend someone else, but they learn to deal with it and embrace the differences. If your friend has a different religion, it doesn't mean you'll stop talking to them. Thirdly, when you express yourself, there will inevitably be people who won't agree with you. You might create a book, a song, or a movie that will offend someone in some way. For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some guys and girls. There can be a disagreement between two girls arguing over which character is better for @CAPS4. There is always an opposing side. A @CAPS2 might get tired of hearing about @CAPS5 all the time and might find it offensive when a girl might compare him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1, saying why can't boys be like them. But even then, they don't remove @CAPS3 entirely. For you, it might seem like the greatest movie ever, or the most terrible one in the universe. Fourthly, another example is a @CAPS8 show called, '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (queen of the south), where a woman who started with nothing ended up being the most wanted in some countries. Some people might think it's cool to be like her. But people aren't likely to go out and do what she does because the television show clearly depicts all the consequences of such actions. This show serves as an example of what could happen if you try to be exactly like her. Some offensive material can teach a lesson and prevent a person from doing something they might later regret. In conclusion, everything in our life offends us in some way. It doesn't matter what it is; we learn to deal with it, and our life goes on. There's no single way to view this, but one thing you enjoy might be offensive to others. It wouldn't be fair to take away something you enjoy just because it offended one person. So, I believe that the library's censorship isn't at risk. In my opinion, everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to, and also the choice to stop doing so.
792	3769	2	3	My views are that if a certain material is offensive to someone or a group of people, it shouldn't be immediately taken off the shelf. Instead, if the material is explicit, one should have to obtain permission from a parent or guardian. For example, in a store where you buy CDs, games, etc., you have to be of a certain age to purchase the material. The same principle should apply to books. Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1'. It shouldn't be removed from the shelf just because of its name. This brings up the well - known saying: don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name doesn't meet someone's standards, it shouldn't matter. One should pick the book up, read the back, and understand what it's actually about. Then, if it's not what you expected, talk to someone in charge and clearly explain the problem. Also, having a section of the store or library just for adults only might sound a bit odd, but it can actually be very helpful. There are numerous books out there that contain content not suitable for children. For instance, love books often describe love and passion in ways that are highly inappropriate for children. If there was such a section in a store or library, it could effectively keep these inappropriate things away from children's minds. You or anyone else wouldn't have to worry about children picking up certain materials that you don't want them to see. Just keep this in mind the next time you're in a library and see something you wouldn't like for your children to encounter. In conclusion, by implementing these measures, we can strike a balance between allowing access to various materials and protecting children from inappropriate content.
793	3770	2	3	Censorship is an extremely sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censorship, either directly or indirectly. Throughout history, there have been numerous complaints and intense arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship. If censorship were to be uniformly applied to everyone, there would be nothing left in the world that isn't censored. Censorship is a major concern when it comes to books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. Writers and directors must strive to create interesting topics or storylines while also ensuring that the content is appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor every piece of literature or film that offended them in some way, then everything in life would end up being censored. No matter what, there will always be a situation where at least one person in the world will be offended. Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1. The citizens of the @LOCATION1 are granted the fundamental freedoms of speech and the press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would naturally think that censorship goes against the law, as it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, as they are all closely related to the freedom of speech or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship starts to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some form just because one person finds it offensive. Some citizens might argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all the inappropriate, offensive, and derogatory language and situations from the nation's youth. However, from a teenager's perspective, children will find out about such situations and language use eventually. There's no point in hiding the truth from anyone, as they will discover it sooner or later. We need to advocate for less censorship in the @LOCATION1. If we want to preserve our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the First Amendment, then we need to actively fight against censorship and eliminate it from our society. In conclusion, by standing up against unnecessary censorship, we can safeguard our rights and ensure a more open and free society.
794	3771	2	3	Libraries everywhere might have one or two books that could potentially be offensive to a reader. As for me, I haven't come across a book that offended me in my readings so far. Some people might think that certain music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the library shelves. However, there are others, like me, who are against such removal. It's going to take more than just one person's opinion to remove music, magazines, etc., from the library. Music in the library is valuable because you can find old music from the @DATE1's, which you might not easily find in a regular music store. If someone finds the music in the library offensive, it might be because they don't understand the history behind the music or what the artist has been through. For example, if a person is offended by hip - hop music, there are likely books in the library that can help them learn about its origin. Maybe after learning about it, they won't be so offended. Magazines in the library are a great resource for people who are interested in the media. There are so many magazines that contain interesting facts about past events or upcoming happenings. For instance, @ORGANIZATION1 magazine has all the latest events or significant happenings in just that one issue. Moreover, there are advertisements in magazines. How would companies make money if they didn't place their advertisements in magazines so that people could buy their products? If there were no advertisements, fewer people would buy the products. Movies in the library are often used by teachers to show students. A lot of the materials in the library can also be found at places like Blockbuster or Walmart. The library has both old movies and records of current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie that corresponds to the book a reader has read. Some people are more visual learners and prefer to watch the movie after reading the book. Overall, I sincerely hope that the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and that the way the library operates remains unchanged. Some books might already have been removed from the shelves due to people's complaints or being offended. But it's already too late for those books. And it will take more than one person's opposition to change the current situation. So, this is my view on keeping music, magazines, and movies in the library. In conclusion, libraries should continue to offer a diverse range of materials to meet the various needs of their patrons.
795	3772	2	3	I believe that everyone has their own opinion on what's appropriate and what's not. You can't just take a few people and ask for their opinion because everyone is different. We all have the right to access books and understand what the author really wants us to learn or hear about. As I've said, everyone is unique. If you don't want your @CAPS1 to read a certain book, tell your @CAPS1 why and explain it clearly. Don't make the rest of the @CAPS1 miss out on potential knowledge. I believe that some parents seem to forget that in the past, they weren't even allowed to have dreams and express their thoughts freely. Why would we want our @CAPS1 to go through the same restrictions? @CAPS1 @CAPS2, everyone should have the right to read, listen to, or engage with whatever makes them happy. So what if there is vulgar language in it? You can either get over it or simply choose not to listen to it. Would you like it if someone told you that your life story was bad and they didn't like the way you worded things? That's the way you talk because it's your life story. The way I see it, we should let the children of this generation learn about the bad things in life so that they can stay away from them. At the same time, we should also inform them about the good things in life so that they won't always live in fear. Let the children read whatever they want to read. If they come across curse words, tell your @CAPS1 that it's bad language. Don't get rid of good books, movies, or music just because the author has a different view on life than yours. Open your mind and don't be so narrow - minded. In conclusion, by allowing children the freedom to explore different forms of media and literature, we can help them grow into well - informed and open - minded individuals.
796	3773	2	3	If you are sitting in the library, quietly minding your own business while doing your homework and studying for a test that's coming up in the next hour, I wouldn't think you'd want to be bothered. Would you? Well, I'm going to explain what I think about everything that's in the libraries. Like some stuff we should have there and some stuff we shouldn't. I believe you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a library.  There are some things in the world today that a lot of people find offensive. There are people who are offensive and things that go on in our and your area where you live that are really offensive. When it comes to our libraries, there are some things that need to be changed and some things that don't need to be bothered. There are some books that some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries, but to other people, they might enjoy them. But I don't believe that they should be taken off the shelf. They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to them easily.  You wouldn't like for some books to be taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids. They just need to be moved to a shelf where only bigger kids can get to. When I am studying, I like to listen to music. It helps me think about what I am doing and calms me down. But when I don't have my music playing, I don't like when other people have theirs too loud. That's one thing that needs to be changed in the libraries. Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf. Another thing that has been a problem is magazines. There are a lot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be monitored. I believe if anything is offensive, it should be taken off the shelf.  Some people get upset very easily and this world is full of offensive things. People need to think about other people. If they don't, somebody might take it the wrong way and it could lead to trouble. In the end, we should make libraries a place where everyone can study and enjoy appropriate materials without being exposed to offensive content.
797	3774	2	3	I disagree that certain material, such as books, movies, or magazines that are offensive to some, should be removed from the shelves of libraries. There are three reasons why I argue this topic. One reason is that books, music, etc. that are inappropriate should not be placed in a section where a child would typically go to look for a book. A second reason is that when a child tries to check - out a book and the book is inappropriate, they should have to show identification to prove that they are of age. The third reason I think that such things should stay on shelves is because adults have a need for books, movies, music, etc. for various reasons.  There should be nothing inappropriate in a library that a child can easily get a hold of. A child should only have access to appropriate materials so that parents do not have to be worried about the things their child hears, sees, or reads. There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book and check it out. This is where the problem begins.  All libraries should identify each child when they check - out a book, magazine, or music. That's why movies are rated, so that a parent can know what kind of movie their child is going to be watching. A parent should keep a close eye on what their child reads or sees.  I think that inappropriate things should stay on shelves, but I also think they should stay in the adult section of the library. Children should not be able to go into the section for adults. The inappropriate things on the shelves could be useful for adults in some cases. There are some materials that an adult may need to help in life.  In conclusion, children should not be able to get a hold of inappropriate material in a library. All libraries should verify the identity of those accessing inappropriate material, and adults should be able to have this type of material available on the shelves in libraries. This way, both the needs of adults and the protection of children are considered.
798	3775	2	3	If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone? In my opinion, I believe that there are some references, including movies, books, music, magazines, and more, that are inappropriate. However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves just because they are offended by it.  If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left. In my mind, everything could possibly be offensive to someone. For example, I read a book where they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like many others do. The way they portrayed all cheerleaders was horrible. Considering I've been a dedicated cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all. After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it. I wasn't going to go back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, just one person, didn't like it.  My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you. I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies isn't always the only ones that come across them. For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inappropriate languages or scenes. That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are suitable for you. Or parents, censor what your children see, hear, and read about.  Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf. Those authors or creators worked just as hard as anyone else. Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else.  In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people. I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it. It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and hard work. Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but that's the reality. People just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do. We should respect the creativity of artists and allow diverse works to be available for those who appreciate them.
799	3776	2	3	Without books, we all would not know what we know now. It's just like saying without a heart, your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real - life things that happen or can happen if you do certain things. Personally, books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you gain a better understanding of many things that someone else may not know or understand. The same thing goes for music, movies, and magazines.  I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also, someone else is thinking differently than they are. Books are another way of learning as well. Not all of them are bad for the younger or whomever it may be. They also help you get a better meaning of a lot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most people's main problem, but there are also some movies, music, and magazines. But some of them indicate what age they are suitable for. For movies, they tell you things like 'PG - 13', 'R' and other ratings. Also, for music, all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they are labeled as having or not having anything inappropriate. Magazines come in many different varieties for all ages and you can pick the ones you want for you or your child.  Everything is not all bad. It is up to you to decide what is right for your child or whomever it may be. You can't blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look beyond the obvious and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and do certain things to better themselves as individuals. People are so quick to judge others but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help. Just because your life or whatever may seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone else's can't change. Those things are there for a reason. If you don't like it, then find a better way to avoid it.  Without those things in our life, I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about. So, just try to picture all that being taken away. It's not a pretty sight. We should accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of our ability. They all serve a purpose. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of media and use it as a tool for learning and growth while also being responsible in guiding the consumption of younger generations.
800	3777	2	3	Materials that are offensive to some people, in my point of view, should not be removed from the shelves. If some people are offended by materials, they shouldn't pay any attention to those particular materials. If everybody had the right to take something off the shelf because it offended them, there would be hardly anything left. There are many things that people see, hear, and read about that can be offensive. Don't take everything seriously; most of those offensive things might just be a joke or some person trying to get attention.  When you just sit and think about it, most television shows you watch every day might have at least one moment that says something offensive. For example, I watch a television show some nights that makes racial remarks about a certain group. I don't pay the show any attention because I know it's just a show trying to get more ratings. So, when it really comes down to it, I'll be watching the same show again the next night.  What if some of our most historical people had listened to everything that everyone else said about them? Then, our black culture and history wouldn't be as rich today. I probably wouldn't be able to take this test that I'm doing right now. So, don't take everything so seriously; everyone has some type of humor.  If we removed everything that was offensive today, some of your favorite actors and singers wouldn't be the famous actors or singers you love and respect today. All of the Grammy's and award shows that we watch on television would not be the same. There are all kinds of different genres of music. Some of the words that different artists use would be offensive, but they still release those same songs because they're just words.  My conclusion is that anything and anyone can be offended or offensive. People shouldn't take everything seriously because it might just be a joke or some ignorant person that needs attention. When I was younger, my mother always said'sticks and stones may break your bones but words only make you stronger'. So, don't take everything seriously. I mean, it's only the media. Who really takes them seriously all the time? In the end, we should learn to tolerate a certain level of offensiveness and not let it disrupt our enjoyment of various forms of entertainment and cultural expressions.
801	3778	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed. It would truly benefit society in numerous ways. Here are some ways how. All books are different. Some @MONTH1 contain offensive language. If books have offensive language, you don't have to read it out loud. You can always substitute other appropriate words in there for those offensive ones or just skip over them as if nothing happened. Some books mention sexual things in them that @MONTH1 might offend a particular race or a gender. If books are too sexual for your age group, then I would recommend choosing a new book. But no matter how you look at it, the situation could always be much worse than what it currently is. Music also needs some censorship. When you're listening to the radio, a CD, or an iPod, you can't always censor it yourself. The radio companies need to do a better job at censoring offensive content out of songs. Many young teens think it's cool to use vulgar language, which is a concerning trend. Movies have different ratings for different age groups. I'm sure no one would let a two - year - old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie. That poor kid would have nightmares for a week. So, censorship would really assist parents in choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one they know nothing about. Magazines are often just full of gossip. Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad or the good in people. There should be some censorship in magazines because they are essentially talking about a person's life. Some say kids are like sponges. Whatever the kid hears, they will repeat. Whatever a kid sees, they will try to imitate. So, whatever a kid reads or watches will probably have a similar effect. Things do need a little censorship. If we didn't have that, it's hard to tell what the world would be like. The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation whatsoever. However, if we take things away completely, the world would seem rather dull. I know that when I was a little kid, I would hear something on the radio and think it was cool to say. My parents wouldn't know what to do with me. I know as an adult, I wouldn't want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship is essential for a healthy and well - informed society.
802	3779	2	3	No, I don't think that should happen. That would be really stupid, and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it. One reason is that adults enjoy all of that stuff. And if they were doing this because kids keep getting into them, then simply get a door that says @NUM1 and older and install cameras. If kids' parents complain, then at least you can say that it's all in one room and no kids are allowed. This shouldn't be a big deal. If you're a kid, you're going to be around such things all the time when you grow up. So, you might as well get used to it. It is a big deal if you're cursing all the time, but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff. When I was growing up, I was around all that stuff, and I think I turned out alright. We can't completely shield kids from the real world, but we can guide them to make the right choices. In the end, a bit of exposure at the right time can help kids develop a sense of judgment.
803	3780	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. I firmly believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some students read books on a daily basis, and reading also keeps some students out of trouble. The reason I say that is because if you find a book you're interested in, you might share it with your younger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also, some offensive books show students what not to do. They illustrate how people who do bad things have to pay the cost, and people can learn from other people's mistakes. Some offensive books show what to do or what not to do so that you wouldn't have to pay the price for doing something wrong. Also, music can be offensive because of the cursing that some of the songs have in them. The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs can speak and take action in a certain way. The offensive part about the music is that some music is calming and keeps you motivated inside, while some music has bad vibes and can make you do bad things. Most of the time, music can make you happy, and you can understand a lot in life just by listening to it. Music is a description of life, meaning that life is full of offensive things, but you have to be very self - centered to understand. Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable, and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times, movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in them. The titles in the movie can also be offensive, but that doesn't mean the movie has a bad relation in the story. Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of them. Some magazines show appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also, there are different things like activities and things for family and friends to enjoy. Many magazines are different in their own way; it depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magazine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the superstars in the music career. There are a lot of things that can be offensive in the world, but you have to learn how to separate yourself from the negative things in life. Also, all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we hear these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen to what the magazines and movies are telling you because you have a mind of your own. People don't always listen to what the books and etc. are saying because some of the things they are talking about are false information. So, that's why I say @CAPS7 I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Sincerely, @ORGANIZATION1. In conclusion, being discerning about the materials we consume is crucial for a positive and healthy mindset.
804	3781	2	3	Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because of one person's opinion. Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book, then don't take them to the library in the first place. In a public library, you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book. So, if you are old enough to have a library card, then obviously you aren't going to find a book that is inappropriate for your own age. You might find a book that seems immature to you, but you do not have to read it. Men and women go to public libraries to learn. If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't be able to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. Is that fair? You tell me. In a school library, yes, there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. In a junior high school, the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. In an elementary school, children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive. Therefore, they will not need those types of books in their library. In a junior high school, there should be a limit on the offensiveness, but the students still have a right to know what is going on around them. In a senior high school, students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please. Magazines are a different subject. A lot of times in magazines, there are advertisements for smoking products or alcoholic beverages. Those types of magazines should not be allowed to be read in a school library. In a public library, a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases. In the end, I'm saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent, you should. Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth in a way that restricts their natural curiosity. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library content is necessary to meet the diverse needs of different age groups.
805	3782	2	3	People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into. If everyone could just pull off a book or magazine, etc., then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturity on the material. Levels are often represented by letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that there will probably be some naked and sexual play in the video or song. With this rating on it, it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it, they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear. Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual acts, inappropriate language, and blood. It can also stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine - year - old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. However, since the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be allowed to watch it, then it's implying they should be mature enough to see or hear it. We should be happy that we can have some control over what our children watch and listen to. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies, etc., but over time, I'm sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time, we will find an old copy of a book on a website. We cannot protect our kids their whole life, so over time, we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can. In conclusion, while ratings and parental control are important, allowing children to gradually develop their own judgment is also crucial for their growth.
806	3783	2	3	Does censorship really help or set back our libraries? Does it try to mask what really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive, while to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. It's all in perspective.  Personally, I think that taking out some of the 'offensive' books in libraries could be a disaster. In one book that we read this year in my English class was 'Fahrenheit 451'. This book was all about a dystopia where people burnt books that didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings, and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the United States. Libraries are a place that sparks imagination for all ages, and if you censor things out, then how is that supposed to happen?  Looking at books in the past that were defined as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in English class at school, were mostly about women's rights and civil rights. Some of them just had bad words in them, and others were about dystopias. If you took out all of those books that pertained to these topics, how many books would you have left? And for that matter, my best friend is an African - American girl, and we both have equal rights now, and we both have jobs, so what's the big deal with living in the past? There is also the fact that it is inevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools, and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life, then why can't you read about it?  Now when people who are all for the censorship in libraries say something to the effect of 'What about the children, I don't want them reading a book that I think is offensive,' I say then censor them. It's your own choice on how you raise your kids, but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. It's good to have a variety of things to read that doesn't limit the brain.  All in all, I think people who would want to censor books are crazy, and it could potentially be taken way out of hand, and then a dystopian society would form. Children should not be disillusioned on what the world is and could be. Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of others.
807	3784	2	3	In the literary world of today, it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials, and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics, it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.  Removing books from the shelves of a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the Constitution. In the United States, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our Constitution as the first ten amendments to the Constitution. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By removing a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the Constitution and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the United States. By violating the Constitution openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the Constitution. The president could act like a dictator, we could turn into a communist - like state, and many other actions are then allowed, leaving the Constitution as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the Constitution, the United States is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.  The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming into a society. Every year, thousands of new books are introduced to the American public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves and out of the public's hands, you effectively stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that it was when the censorship began.  Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel 'Fahrenheit 451' by Ray Bradbury, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that'makes them think' is locked up or killed. The main character's job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything; they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out classic literature or the Bible. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all interest in higher learning. That is why censorship can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.  Although censorship may seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society, causing society to grind to a halt and stay right where it is. Not only is it detrimental to a society, but it is also clearly unconstitutional if you look at the Constitution of the United States. So let us hope that although we may play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to nowhere.
808	3785	2	3	I think everything should be there. The examples of things that should be there are: all magazines, books, and internet service. For the magazines, there should be all cars, trucks, ATVs, MTVs, UTVs, ESPN, golf, Game Informers, and WWE magazines.  Now for the books. All the types of books that should be allowed are science - fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance, history, and self - help books. And last, the internet service. The internet service should be used for school work, to play all games on any website, and to use YouTube on any computer.  This all should be used there because certain things some kids don't have at home. For instance, not all kids have access to a wide range of magazines or a high - speed internet connection at home. The library should be a place that provides these resources equally to all. By having all these materials available, it can enrich the learning experience and entertainment options for everyone, regardless of their home situation.
809	3786	2	3	Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many different interests. Whether that be cars, boats, toys, or animals, it shouldn't matter what the interest is. I firmly believe that a library should have books on tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possibly learn about it.  This is an ongoing debate nationwide, and there is going to have to be a decision made fast! There are too many people making enemies all over the world over this issue. I was asked to submit my opinion, and I believe that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want to. If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked out, then they don't have to watch it.  There are multiple solutions to the problem. The libraries could have different sections for different types of books, such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get a hold of anything that they shouldn't be watching or reading. That way, the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with.  Well, I can't wait to see how the results turn out! I also hope the people make the right vote. I'm not saying that my vote is the only way; it's just my opinion. Either way, there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy. So thank you, committee, and organization for letting me voice my opinion!
810	3787	2	3	I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in, like a section only for adults. I think if a kid sees something they think is interesting and will teach them something they didn't know before, they're going to pick it up no matter what, unless someone steps in and tells them not to.  I don't think kids should be exposed to all of that, and some kids are getting ahead where they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that, either they shall have an ID or their parent should be with them confirming they are able to check out that book.  Many children, I think, are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around, and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages, but then again, that's only for adults to read, and it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fantasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that, and it could really affect someone badly.  If a parent wants their kid to have the book or doesn't mind anything about it, then that's their choice. They have permission. I know I wouldn't want my kids around that until they were 18 years of age or older, but I know some parents don't really care a lot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit. This way, we can balance the access to different types of literature while protecting the well - being of children.
811	3788	2	3	Throughout my life, I have seen numerous books that appear offensive to me. However, these books should not be censored merely because they seem offensive. I firmly believe that books deemed offensive should remain uncensored. A key reason for this stance is that what might seem offensive to one individual may not be offensive to another. Classifying something as offensive is a subjective opinion. Unless every single person in the entire world considered a book offensive, it should be accessible to the public. Another reason we should refrain from censoring offensive books is that in our society, we are granted the right to express ourselves freely. If we were to censor books that are found offensive, we would be blatantly violating this fundamental right. This would be unfair not only to the authors who wrote the books but also to those who appreciate them. The next rationale is that if we were to censor every book we found offensive, we would ultimately have no books left to read. Books that some people adore are often found offensive by others. For instance, imagine a group of people who are huge fans of the @ORGANIZATION1 series. But then, another person reads it and deems it offensive and gets it censored. Subsequently, the fans of the @ORGANIZATION1 series might retaliate by trying to censor the books that the other person likes. If this cycle of censorship continues, we would be left with no books at all. Another crucial reason is that without offensive books, we would never learn from the terrible mistakes of the past. Suppose all books related to both World Wars were censored and made unreadable. Eventually, people would forget the atrocities that occurred, and history might repeat itself. Unless having books that seem offensive is a greater evil than the repetition of the events we dread, offensive books should not be censored. In conclusion, I firmly believe that books found offensive should not be censored because doing so would violate the right to free expression and allow the lessons of the past to be forgotten. Moreover, without these so - called offensive books, we would have a severely limited selection of reading materials.
812	3789	2	3	They will see it eventually. I firmly believe there is no valid reason to censor a library. Instead of full - scale censorship, sectioning off the books could be sufficient. For example, placing the 'offensive' books at the back of the library can serve as a form of reasonable censorship. We also need to consider the publishers' perspective. They aim to sell and promote their products, and they have a legitimate right to do so. Libraries should not remove their products from the shelves just because someone stumbles upon something they believe is offensive. We are all aware of the potentially offensive content that can be found in libraries or bookstores, such as @ORGANIZATION1. This may include inappropriate pictures, references to drugs, firearms, etc. In my opinion, these materials are already subject to enough censorship. Most magazines that many people find 'offensive' are typically placed at the back of the store or sectioned off. This way, people are less likely to accidentally encounter them, and parents don't have to worry about their children flipping through the pages and having their minds corrupted. Some materials are even encased in plastic sleeves, requiring the purchaser to buy the item before reading it. If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should have the same right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I certainly do. There is no justifiable reason why you shouldn't be able to. In @LOCATION1, it is unfair for the library to censor your book simply because someone else deems it offensive. In conclusion, libraries should refrain from censoring any materials. Whether offensive or not, publishers have the right to publish and promote their works, and libraries should respect this right.
813	3790	2	3	I don't think books should be publicly exploited if certain individuals feel offended by them. However, since I personally don't get offended by anything, my opinion may differ from others. Nevertheless, if the library receives a continuous stream of complaints about this issue, I can understand why they might consider removing the book. So, what I'm suggesting is that if the book only offends a select few and doesn't cause a widespread problem, it should be kept in the library. But the library should inform those who are offended that the book will be placed out of sight, thus eliminating the issue. I don't believe that librarians would intentionally display books that they know will offend the public. They keep the books in the library for their intended purpose, which is to be read. I've visited the public library numerous times, and during all those visits, I've never come across anything that offended me or made me uncomfortable. The books in the library are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge. Without them, I believe it would have a negative impact on our nation as a whole because we rely on knowledge to carry out various activities, and the more knowledge we have, the better our lives will be. In conclusion, libraries should retain all books unless the book causes a major problem and a large number of people consistently voice their concerns about it.
814	3791	2	3	I think that everyone has unique views on different matters, so I don't believe books or movies should be censored. Censoring them would be a direct violation of the First Amendment, which guarantees everyone the freedom of religion and speech. If you disagree with a book or a movie, you can simply ignore it and move on without paying any attention to it. Nowadays, people tend to take their opinions to an extreme. They need to mind their own business and stop assuming that the world revolves around them. There are billions of people in @LOCATION1, and each person perceives things slightly differently. This fact should be taken into account when people get angry just because there is a book or movie on the library shelf. For example, I enjoy comedies and sometimes scary movies. However, girls may not like scary movies and instead prefer movies with drama or something similar. Just because we have different preferences doesn't mean we should limit the library's collection to only a certain type of books or movies. Yes, there are movies that I dislike because they go against my religious beliefs. But I don't go around saying that no one should watch these movies. Just because I don't believe in them doesn't mean I should judge others for watching them. I know some people think that everyone should see things the same way and that everyone should agree and get along. But that's an unrealistic expectation. No matter how much we wish for people to agree, it will never happen. In conclusion, people need to respect others' choices and let them read, listen to, and watch whatever they want. It shouldn't offend anyone, and we should all try to understand different perspectives instead of imposing our own views on others.
815	3792	2	3	I firmly believe that if something is found offensive to one person, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be offensive to another. In libraries, there is a wide range of materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Some of these items may seem offensive to some people, but others may enjoy them. Therefore, these materials should not be taken away from those who appreciate them. Certain types of content, like adult novels and explicit music, are often considered offensive. But what many fail to understand is that some people genuinely enjoy consuming this kind of material. Taking it away from them is unjust. Everyone should have the freedom to have different likes in these areas because we are all unique individuals. When you visit a library, you should be able to find something that suits your taste and piques your interest. If the things that people like are being removed, it severely limits their options. It's as if they are being excluded from enjoying the things they love just because others find them offensive. Those who think certain things are offensive are, of course, entitled to their opinion. But so are those who believe these things are good. There should always be a diverse range of books, music, and other materials that appeal to different personalities. Everyone has the right to voice their dislike for something. However, what one person doesn't like, another person may love. So, taking away things that other people enjoy is an act of injustice. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a rich and diverse collection of materials to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to access the things they enjoy, regardless of others' opinions.

These libraries serve as repositories of knowledge, housing works that span various genres and eras. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. These books may have become outdated or contain content that no longer holds value. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.  Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discriminate against certain ethnicities need to be removed immediately from libraries. However, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they often offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!  Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Similarly, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries. By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.  Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' However, that is a naive comment as well as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check - out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.  In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as well. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society.
817	3794	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book shelves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views on the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and the diverse beliefs of people to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries?  There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from heart - warming romances, action - packed adventures, and spine - chilling scary stories. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other materials such as: music, movies, and magazines.  I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what I was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the foul language and misinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very good either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You have the scary, gory and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well as let them be aware of what life is about.  I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes, it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to strive for the best.  Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said, written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it in a better way. In the end, these materials can contribute to a more informed and tolerant society.
818	3795	2	3	In the quote that @PERSON1 wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provocative. This is a very interesting quote. She talks about how things should be taken off the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it. In everyday life, there are things said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear or read.  Some movies can be way too provocative. Directors try to cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across. Some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it. People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over. When parents get movies they try to keep those scenes hidden from their children. The parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying. Too many children take the movies to the extreme and try to act like the actors or actresses, and the children end up getting hurt from these actions.  Music is especially one to do this. There are not a lot of songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content in them. Many parents do not want their children to be exposed to that way too soon. If people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said. Mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to. That is not a mother's dream to go and do that.  There are too many magazines that try to expose women. They use this to try and sell more magazines. This is wrong to do. A little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her, this is just wrong. Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea. When girls look at a model in a magazine they try to be just like the model. The girls end up being underweight, sick, and maybe do drugs. Parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve.  Some parents let their kids get away with too much. They should censor what their children do. Some kids will try to get around them so there is not much helping them. Everyone's point of view is different. One person might think that this scene is too provocative and another person might look at that and say there is nothing wrong. It just depends on how society feels about the whole situation. If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf. We need to find a balance between protecting children and allowing creative freedom in the media.
819	3796	2	3	Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world. They contain many different styles and genres of books, from classic literature to modern best - sellers. Some might not be appropriate for young children to read. There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves. I believe that no book should be denied of this right. Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.  Most libraries have children sections. Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section. So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway. Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.  Next, if a child goes up to the check - out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child. Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library. If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.  Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like. They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off. If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves. The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly. People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not. Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.  There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing. Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen. Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen. Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read. Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read. In the end, the responsibility lies with parents and guardians to guide their children's reading choices, rather than censoring books from library shelves.
820	3797	2	3	Censorship has become a major part of the media nowadays. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of @DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored from their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in @DATE1's society.  Censorship should be more focused on the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown - ups and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly affected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies.  Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they cannot use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society.  The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media. Instead, we should rely on parental guidance and personal responsibility to deal with potentially offensive content.
821	3798	2	3	How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone in the library, and kept hearing explicit bad words from a song that was part of the library's collection! Would you really want such an environment for your child? One usually thinks a library was supposed to be a pure learning center, but didn't know it could turn into a bad place to be. People have their own opinions on everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming increasingly dirty and unappealing to people. Please help try and help us stop this trend! We don't want it to influence our kids, like it has affected others!   Some people are attracted to these kinds of media with bad actions in them! One thing that lures them in is the catchy beat, which just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is because their friends also enjoy it! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders as they should be. When people grow up, they usually have an idol, whether it's a singer, a book writer, or an actor. When that idol grows older, it most likely isn't going to be the same person with the same positive thoughts it had @DATE1. They change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the allure of fame that it puts them in. When that happens, people lose interest in them unless they think it's cool! It all just depends on the individual! Some people thrive off of these negative influences!   Libraries are supposed to be suitable for all ages! If a kid finds something inappropriate at a library and tells their friends or parents, that's just giving a bad reputation to the library, and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will lose a lot of its business. Young kids these days are being exposed to a lot more things that they shouldn't be! What little kids already know is sickening! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose, but in my opinion, it's a real concern! Kid's are growing up way too fast because of the things that they are exposed to!   Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's. Yeah, they weren't perfect back then, but it's gotten a little extreme these days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the pictures we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the inappropriate content in the music, movies, and magazine articles/pictures. People should have IDs that they have to present to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are exposed to these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but it's worth a try!   The world isn't a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects their actions and thoughts! People should try and do the littlest things to make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay away from these bad things; seeing bad pictures, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! Don't be a follower because it's not going to get you anywhere in life! Everything counts, and we should all strive to create a better environment for our kids.
822	3799	2	3	I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not have a comprehensive understanding of life to survive. The books and various forms of media help the human race empathize with each other and know about things that have already happened so that we don't repeat history and make the same mistakes all over again. Some books are created for entertainment purposes, while others are for education and help children learn about what happened in the past. Taking books off the shelves of schools and libraries would be unjust because you are depriving children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and understanding what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms. Books that are truly offensive should be taken off the shelves, but not the books that make sense to people and help them succeed in life.   Some schools in poor countries don't have enough books to read. The children there don't have much to do besides go to school and learn. Books are important in so many ways that it would cause a great deal of chaos if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who did it. Some books may seem confusing, but that doesn't matter whether it makes sense or not. In conclusion, books are an essential part of our lives, and we should ensure that valuable books remain on the shelves for everyone to access.
823	3800	2	3	In today's world, there are so many movies and books that it's extremely hard to watch or read all of them. They all have different looks and unique ideas. Every person in the world is not going to like all of the same movies, books, and music because we all have different tastes. That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf. I think they create so many different types of everything because we do have different beliefs, such as religion, social class, and culture.   Music has a wide variety of genres, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on. And if you just take it off the shelf because someone somewhere thought it was offensive, we would not have a rich and diverse music culture. I don't really have many things that I get offended by, but I do know that I have seen some shows that were inappropriate, and some people, I'm guessing, thought they were funny.   Books also have many different genres, just like music. So if a book has a bad word, or a rude anecdote, some people @MONTH1 might not like it. However, books are good to read. It would be a great loss if they were all gone. Then it would be extremely difficult to learn or teach anything. Take for an example The @CAPS1 is one of the most widely read books in the world, and if they just took it off the shelf because some people don't believe in it, so many things would change, and religions would not be the same in any way.   That is the way it's going to be with all forms of media, and most people do take offense to certain things. The way I see it in my mind is that if they don't like it, they don't have to read, watch, or listen to it. Every business in these industries is taking a risk. It's all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc.   So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad choice for this. That is why we have our own free will and can make the choices that we want, whether they are good or bad, right or wrong. You might not think about it much, but things like this do happen. It might not be in your town, but somewhere out there in the world, it will be occurring. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of media and let people make their own choices.
824	3801	2	3	There are some certain materials that I think are offensive to children, such as books, music, movies, and even magazines. Books can contain a lot of materials that are unsafe for children because they can easily get a hold of @CAPS1 books and other inappropriate materials. Another concern is music, and even music videos often have a lot of profanity in them. Movies, such as @CAPS1 movies, some children @MONTH1 might watch them and then imitate what they have watched on TV. The next thing is magazines, which may have inappropriate pictures in them. That's why they should take the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelf. By doing so, we can create a safer environment for children and protect them from being exposed to harmful content. In conclusion, it's our responsibility to ensure that children are not negatively influenced by these inappropriate materials.
825	3802	2	3	How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out, you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.   For my first reason, it goes along with personal values. For example, a person of higher authority @MONTH1 might find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library, they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics. It's unjust to let one person's values dictate what others can read.   My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in, the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person. A diverse collection of books is essential for a library to serve all its patrons.   People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does, our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies, so if these were limited to only particular subjects, people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.   Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies, a person could learn about many different things and develop a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind, people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interests. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present. In conclusion, we should uphold the freedom of reading and respect everyone's right to choose what they want to engage with.
826	3803	2	3	Should we remove books and media because they are offensive? I do not believe so. In this essay, I will describe to you precisely why I hold this view. The word “offensive” is a controversial one. Is it the scenes of kissing that render books and media offensive, or is it the use of curse words or depictions of fighting? Different people perceive different things as offensive. Many of the books today's youth read are considered “offensive” by older generations. This is because today's standards have changed. Children now have more freedom to do and say as they please, causing the meaning of “offensive” to evolve. If a book, song, or video is offensive, then it is the parents' responsibility to address it with their children. What is offensive to some people may be perfectly acceptable to others. Just because such content exists doesn't mean we have to be exposed to it. So, in conclusion, I firmly believe that books and media should not be removed from the shelf for being offensive, as the concept of “offensive” is constantly changing and varies from person to person.
827	3804	2	3	In my personal opinion, I am convinced that certain materials, whether in books, music, magazines, or movies, should be removed or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with good manners, refrain from using foul language, and avoid making out with their boyfriend or girlfriend at inappropriate times. Yet, we seem to promote such behavior in various forms of media, and that is simply unacceptable. In bookstores or even libraries, there are some books on the shelves that can be deemed inappropriate. We encourage and even urge kids to read, but we can't simply tell them to pick any book they want. These books often contain foul language, gang - related violence, or even sexual gestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a young niece or a baby cousin. There are numerous types of music in the real world. Everyone has their favorite and least - favorite music. In my view, it's impossible to make everyone happy, so we just have to ignore the music we don't like. There are different formats like CDs, cassette tapes, or even records that we can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is inappropriate, but we can always change the radio station. We don't have to purchase that CD, and we can always drive without listening to music. Magazines can sometimes present rather unseemly content. Whether it's a well - known person on the front page with an odd appearance or certain reality - show - related content. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing such things in magazines, but strict parents may not want their kids to be exposed to such actions. Magazines can cover a wide range of topics, from someone's drug use, alcohol consumption, to winning the lottery. We just have to choose what we and our kids look at wisely. People can act quite recklessly in their creative expressions. Whether it's in writing, singing, or pictures, there will always be someone doing something inappropriate. This is the reality, and there's not much we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you don't want to see it, don't buy it. It's as simple as that.
828	3805	2	3	Censorship in libraries! Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I firmly believe they should not be removed. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because something is offensive to one person, it may not be offensive to another. No two people think exactly the same or have identical opinions about everything. That's why there is a wide variety of books, music, movies, etc. available. If we were to remove the so - called “offensive” things, it would likely cause offense to someone else. People need to stop being selfish and understand that everyone is different and has different interests. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and keep the variety of materials in libraries, rather than removing them based on individual sensitivities.
829	3806	2	3	Many people, after reading a book, listening to a song, watching a movie, or reading a magazine, have found themselves upset or disturbed by that piece of media and feel that it should be removed from the shelf where they found it. I firmly believe that since everyone has their own unique definition of offensive and disturbing, libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines, or media forms. My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It largely depends on that person's background, religious beliefs, and personal values. I do not think that books, magazines, or other media should have to be banned from library shelves just because a particular person finds that piece of material offensive. If they find it so disturbing, then they should simply stop reading that book or magazine, or listening to that song. One person should not be able to make the decision of keeping or removing a certain book or magazine from the shelf because, somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive. The main purpose of writing a book or creating a song is to express one's opinion on a topic. If the reader or listener does not approve of that opinion, they should respect the director or author's thoughts and move on. If a library or media center has inappropriate books, magazines, or movies, they should create special areas or shelves to store such material. This area could be specifically designated for adult or mature readers, viewers, or listeners. I also think that books and other pieces of media of such inappropriateness should have a clear label regarding its offensive or explicit content. If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing, I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public. There are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hands, especially those who may not be aware of its possible offensiveness. If warning signs are clearly shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed. If such measures are taken, I am confident that they will keep all readers, viewers, and listeners satisfied.
830	3807	2	3	Every person is unique, and due to this uniqueness, people have a wide range of views as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is highly offensive to one person may not be offensive to someone else at all; it is entirely a matter of personal values and beliefs. Libraries house a vast variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on diverse topics, some of which may not be suitable for everyone. I do not believe that a material should be removed from the shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to satisfy the preferences of certain individuals. I do believe, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are well - organized, people are less likely to accidentally pick up something that offends them and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they don't want to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help protect children from accessing unwanted material. To conclude, materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone because every person has different views. However, we can avoid potential conflicts through careful organization. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off the library shelves, there would be hardly anything left. By maintaining a diverse collection and organizing it properly, libraries can serve the needs of a wide range of patrons.
831	3808	2	3	I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because some of the extremely explicit materials these books contain are not suitable for children to read. I feel that these certain materials can be helpful in seeing other people's viewpoints on certain subjects. Though the content of these books can be called offensive, to certain people, this is their culture and how they live. What would happen if every book that was considered offensive was actually removed from the bookshelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial. The eye - opening world presented in these books is truly amazing. The fact that I can read about other people's lives and their everyday struggles is astounding to me. If we all made a huge decision based on one person's opinion, then our world would be a mess. Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then there would be little left to read that can truly engage us. I want to read something that is going to grab my attention and make me want to keep reading. I do not think that I would have that type of experience if these books were removed. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of content in public libraries and not hastily remove so - called offensive books.
832	3809	2	3	I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, whether at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intolerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these important things from occurring. If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will simply stop reading. Not all children and teens are naturally drawn to reading. If there is a book that a reluctant reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Is it because he or she finds it offensive? Or because he or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship. Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, The Grapes of Wrath, and Fahrenheit 451. To Kill a Mockingbird and its author were censored because of the racist language. This language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To Kill a Mockingbird is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in the racially - charged South. The main antagonist is an ignorant, racist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villain of the story. Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated R movie or reading a letter to a certain organization is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading as well. If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then he or she will not be his or her own person. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. They will not have their own views and will be largely ignorant of the world around them. John Milton said, 'He who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' This is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently. These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them. Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow. That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therefore, censorship should not even be considered. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries. In conclusion, upholding the freedom of reading in educational institutions is crucial for the development of well - rounded individuals.
833	3810	2	3	I think that libraries should not remove material such as books, music, movies, and magazines. I think that libraries should keep them because there are a lot of people who have their own style of reading. Sometimes I will go to the library and get a book, then I will go look at magazines, movies, and music. There are a lot of movies available right now, and now you can go check them out. Music is the same way. I feel like if there is stuff in the library that kids like, they should be able to access it. I'm sure that the library also has educational books, movies, and magazines. If people take out stuff that kids and teens like, some of them might not return to the library. There are a lot of students who listen to music and watch movies too. I love checking out movies from the libraries; it's easy and they always have the movies that you are looking for. The movies are easy to find and it's quick. However, if the music or other materials have some offensive stuff in them, they should take it off the shelves because people will wonder why they would put a movie, music, magazines, and books up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public. In conclusion, I hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves. It would bring more people in and they would have more respect for those in charge of the library. The public wouldn't have to worry about picking up a book that has a lot of stuff that their kids do not need to see, read, or listen to. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books, and more. I really hope the people make the right choice, as it will enhance the library experience for everyone.
834	3811	2	3	Nearly every person has seen, heard, written, or said something that offended someone. Most of the people who offend others do it on purpose in their music, books, or movies. While some other people accidentally offend people by the way they worded something. If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still available, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know they're not the only one offended. When someone gets offended by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation of the offensive material they saw or heard. In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book, magazine, movie, or music. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else. A book, magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted on whether to be removed or stay in the library. This way the material has a chance to be available in the future. Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censored version so it's suitable for the people that were not offended. In some cases, there is only one person that got offended by something that was in a library. In these cases, the person could choose to wait until someone else is offended by the material to speak up about its offensiveness. If material is offensive to someone, they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace. If relocated, the material is still available to other people. When voted on, it could stay or be removed. Someone can speak up about the offensive material after someone else finds it offensive as well. In conclusion, handling offensive library materials through relocation, voting, or waiting for more feedback is a balanced approach that respects different viewpoints.
835	3812	2	3	If I think that something is offensive, then yes, it should be removed from the bookshelves. The library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people. If something offended you, then you wouldn't want someone else of the same race, religion, or family to read it and be offended. Yes, we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want, but I think it should only go so far and then should be stopped. Someone can only take so much, and then when they reach that point, nothing turns out any good. If somebody were to write about the blacks and say they are all dumb just because they are black, then the blacks would not just stand around and do nothing. After you call someone names or pick on them so much, it scars them for life and it could hurt their whole communication skills for the rest of their life. Not everyone, but some even take it so far as hurting themselves or others. So if I saw a book on the bookshelves of the public library that offended me, then yes, I would want it to be removed so it doesn't offend anybody else. I don't think that hurting someone's feelings is worth messing up their whole life or causing them to hurt themselves. If something hurt you or offended you, would you just let it happen or would you use the rights that we are given and try to make it right and not hurt anyone else? Would you want someone writing about you in a mean way? You would probably try to make it right. If you could fix something and didn't just because you didn't feel like it and it continued to offend other people, then not only is it the person's fault that wrote it, but I could see it kinda being your fault for letting that person still hurt people. In conclusion, we have a responsibility to ensure that public libraries are free from offensive materials that can cause harm to others.
836	3813	2	3	Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library? My firm belief is no. In today's society, many people themselves exhibit offensive behavior. Books are created to depict either fictional or real - life scenarios. When you censor something, individuals will be highly motivated to seek out an uncensored version of the same material.   Art books, too, should remain uncensored. The artist is not aiming to be perverse or offensive; instead, they are expressing their unique artistic vision in a form they believe the public will appreciate as art.   Censorship does hold some importance, but one must maintain an open mind. What may seem offensive to someone now might not be so later in their life. So, we shouldn't censor something just because it might offend a few, as there are many who likely won't be offended, whether it's books, music, videos, video games, writing, or movies.   We should have a democratic approach to decide what's appropriate. So, what are your thoughts? Should we censor a book due to its content or leave it for the public to judge? My stance is that while censorship can be a moral consideration, it would be immoral to deprive a reader interested in a book. Therefore, please don't censor books from our public library. We need books that contain facts or fiction and have engaging stories within their pages. Let the reader decide whether to censor or keep the book as intended.
837	3814	2	3	I think that if there is a book in the libraries that is harmful, then you should have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out. The reason I say @NUM1 is that at this age, individuals should have a clear understanding of right and wrong and be able to handle inappropriate content. I mean, if you know a book is wrong, then don't read it; no one is forcing you.   It would be different if someone were being forced, but that's not the case. Some people enjoy reading different kinds of books. Just because a book might be harmful to one person doesn't mean it won't be helpful to another. If such books are removed, there may be few books left in the library for anyone to check out and read. After all, every book could potentially hurt someone if they were made to read it.   If you have a problem with this, you can contact me at @NUM3, ask for @PERSON1, and we can discuss it. Maybe you'll be able to change my mind, or after reading this, you might share my view.   The reason I feel this way is that, as I said before, every book has a part that could upset someone. So, you should have to be @NUM1 to check out certain books. If you're getting hurt by a lot of books, I'd suggest you stop reading because a book is just a book, not something to cause harm. There are many people in the world who are passionate about books and research.   What I don't agree with is kids leaving class to go to the library, playing games, and putting puzzles together. That's the issue I have. I mean, it's fine that some people go to the library to work, but some claim to have work when they don't. They just want to skip class. People go in there and play games, and when others need to use the computer, there's no space because of the kids playing games.   But regarding the book part in the library, I have no problem. That's my take on books that might hurt people: if you don't like them, don't read them; others appreciate having them available.
838	3815	2	3	In many libraries, there are books, movies, magazines, and a wide variety of other materials. Some of these items are considered inappropriate for certain age groups. However, I firmly believe that every customer in the library should have the freedom to choose what they want to read. It's up to parents or the individual to decide what information they want to absorb.   Let's start with books. There is an incredibly diverse range of books, from scientific works about human anatomy to fictional tales of dragons and vampires. How can one choose a book that is appropriate? The answer is straightforward. When you're young, your parents assist you in selecting suitable books. As you grow and mature, you start making these choices independently. It's entirely up to you whether you should read a particular book.   Movie guidelines follow a similar pattern. In your youth, your parents help you pick appropriate movies. As you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, check its rating. If it seems intimidating, inappropriate, or violent, you can decide whether to watch it.   Sometimes, you may encounter offensive material in movies or books. If you strongly disapprove of it, take the matter to the librarian. Explain why you think the movie or book is inappropriate and offer some suggestions on how to handle the situation. Some ideas could be to remove the item from the shelf, write an additional review for the book, or write to the author or movie director. The simplest solution, though, is to just ignore the offensive item. If it offends you, return it to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others might still enjoy the item even if you don't.   There are countless books, movies, magazines, etc. in the world. Some may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, but there are also many other acceptable choices. So, if you don't approve of a certain book, simply return it to the library and find one you do like. In conclusion, maintaining this freedom of choice in libraries is essential for a diverse and inclusive reading and viewing experience.
839	3816	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? Well, I firmly believe that they should be put to a vote for everyone who uses that library to decide. The reason is that the staff might consider an item morally incorrect and offensive, but the people checking out the books may have a different opinion. After all, the staff doesn't read all the books; the customers do.   Some people may not find an item offensive as others do because everyone thinks differently. It's almost impossible for two people to have exactly the same thoughts. If the library removes books for the wrong reasons, it may lose its patrons. Every book has something to teach about life, whether we like it or not.   People have different beliefs. In one culture, a particular book may be widely accepted, and if the local library removes it, those from that culture will miss out on using the library. For example, if the library decides to take out the Bible and romance novels, it will lose a significant number of customers, and its business will suffer.   The library staff should not have the sole power to decide which books are allowed. After all, they may have financial incentives, like getting money from fines. So, my answer is a resounding no. We should put it to a vote, considering that some may not find an item offensive and that people have diverse beliefs. In the end, respecting this diversity of opinion is crucial for the success and relevance of the library.
840	3817	2	3	Dear editor,  I firmly feel that we should not take any movies, books, and music off the shelves. Doing so will surely lead to conflicts and potentially result in lawsuits.   I've witnessed firsthand what happens when a book is removed from the shelf. People start raising their voices because they don't find it offensive. They then threaten to sue. Eventually, it costs a significant amount of money to go to court.   The same goes for taking music off the shelves. Initially, people will shout in protest. Then, they may become violent. You'll end up with a mob of people destroying your store because you removed some music.   This is precisely why we need to keep all these items on the shelves. You can interpret this message as you wish, but I sincerely hope you learn from these potential consequences before it's too late. I hope you'll publish this in the paper. Thank you for considering my perspective. Sincerely Yours, @PERSON1.
841	3818	2	3	I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves. I stand firmly with this because it is a personal choice to read material that is found offensive. Just as an adult can choose to avoid certain types of content, a young child is unlikely to seek out inappropriate materials as they are generally not interested in them. It's similar to how an adult wouldn't typically go searching for a children's picture book. There is a natural maturity barrier that separates what each age level is interested in reading. There is no point in removing any material from libraries because it would achieve nothing. People who might get offended, mainly children, are already exposed to violent video - games that glorify war and violence. You simply can't go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive. If you removed offensive material from libraries, then by the same logic, you would have to shut down the internet as well. A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want with just the click of a button. Additionally, libraries have age - level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material. Some people might actually enjoy material that is considered offensive. If such material is removed, a lot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they want. There would be numerous complaints and problems, and some people might even stop going to the library because the content was limited. The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have. This way, many people will be satisfied, and most people will be happy with the diverse range of materials available.
842	3819	2	3	The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that people wish that their kids or even themselves did not read. But if you were to take away every book someone found offensive, there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be at least one person who finds a book unappealing, whether it's due to the tone the author uses or the terms the characters call each other. People all have their own mindset about how they want to live or how they want their kids to live. Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. For instance, if there are books on the shelves about kids drinking and the negative effects it has on their lives, it might deter a child from trying it. There are also books about girls who get raped and are afraid to tell anyone. In the long run, after getting pregnant or injured, they regret not telling earlier. Such stories might help kids who have experienced or might experience similar situations to feel relief and encourage them to tell someone, potentially saving themselves. Books like these should not be taken off the shelf because one person does not like it. In the long run, if they did take it off, some could get hurt or not know what to do, and it could be all that one person's fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone? Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but turns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe. I have a friend whose parents do not like the music on her iPod. So she had to take it off. Well, instead, she made a list of the songs that they did not like. Since she drives, the music is always playing on the radio while she drives, so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her iPod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that people do not like, either due to their religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio, there is still the internet out there, and people can just get their songs from there. There are songs out there that should not be out there, but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people's listening, the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today, there are always good and bad songs. Artists now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use their brains. No one can stop them, not even the people that publish the songs and put them on the radio. In the long run of things, the more people try to stop things from being in this world, the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grows up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understands what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid their age getting kidnapped, they @MONTH1 understand more clearly the reasons in life. So if I can say so myself, I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that a book is not good for their little girl or their teenage son. They need to read it for themselves and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the shelf. Keep playing the music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on their own rather than you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it than having my parents tell me over and over again. So keep the books on the shelves and let the radio play. Just be safe in doing it.
843	3820	2	3	Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no. Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic consequences. It's almost like when people were segregated by race. The segregation led to fights between different groups of people. How would you feel if segregation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair because you cannot do certain things. That is probably how some people feel when they get offended by the media. Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by presenting the people with choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decide what is right and wrong? In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are advantages and disadvantages either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decide what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a diverse media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is unnecessary fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no, depending on the scale of the offense.
844	3821	2	3	Everybody is entitled to making their own decision. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books, then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that decision for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others. That's just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking into consideration the opinions of others. If there are some books that are offensive to a certain type of ethnicity or religion, etc., then just ignore it and move on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out. For all we know, that certain book might be used for research by someone who needs it. Taking out certain books from the library is depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very important for the future. The @CAPS1 is a good example. When it got published, many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional. But that book is now being used in our classroom and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taken out of libraries now and could be deeply appreciated by future writers. Katherine Paterson has the perspective of many authors. Taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books. For hard - working writers, it is unfair to work so hard and have the book banned from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it appropriate. If they don't approve of the book, then they should tell the child not to get it. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted. The library is a place of discovery, not a place of restriction. By keeping a wide range of books in libraries, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to explore different ideas and learn from various literary works.
845	3822	2	3	Libraries are often known for protecting our children and maintaining an educational atmosphere. However, you would be surprised by the content our children @MONTH1 find in such a seemingly friendly place. With a simple library card, children could check out a large amount of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn. But it's impossible for parents to be looking over their child's shoulders all the time. The answer to this problem is strict censorship. Books are large repositories of powerful and vast amounts of information. Even though most parents believe that publishing companies would not let children read books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library whether or not a book can be checked out. Most of the time, only adults can fully understand what the characters in a book are going through. This is probably because of the adult's extensively more life experiences. Another common belief is that separating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem. The fact is, even if an adult checks out a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home. The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censor the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands. Libraries are great for research or school projects, but books and magazines that are inappropriate should never end up in the place built for an educational experience for your kids. Censorship has to be enforced to help keep and maintain our libraries' educational atmosphere and to keep our children safe from offensive material. By implementing strict censorship, we can ensure that libraries remain a safe and educational environment for all children.
846	3823	2	3	I don't think that certain materials should be removed if they're found offensive to people. If someone reads something and it offends them, they can simply go do something else. I'm not the type of person to get offended too easily, so I'm aware that my opinion might not fully resonate with everyone. Everyone gets offended over something, so I can understand why people find certain things offensive. But in all honesty, if someone reads something and thinks that it is offensive, they have the option to either calmly explain why they thought it was offensive, or they could just ignore it. In libraries, I think that if the @CAPS1 finds a story offensive, it should be okay for them to take it off the shelves. After all, they work there and are responsible for the library's collection. If it were me though, I'd just let it go. And if someone asks me to remove it, I might consider doing it based on their valid reasons. A lot of people nowadays seem to take offense over everything. But a material should not be removed from a library shelf, unless the @CAPS1, or the manager, find it offensive. Then I can understand their decision, as they have to balance the diverse needs and sensitivities of the library's patrons.
847	3824	2	3	Censorship on Libraries. Do you ever walk into a library, stroll up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and carefully pick up a book that looks promising and worth reading? Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this seemingly great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the unique style in which this book is written? Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do. But, if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any, books left to read at all. Books based on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisance because they segregate people. When you go to the various sections of your local library, which section do you start walking briskly towards? The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about @CAPS4? If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith, what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You might be uncomfortable about that book being available in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels the same way about your favorite book? This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years. Suppose you casually walk over to an isolated shelf. This very colorful book is really catching your attention. You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about @CAPS2. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of people in this way. People are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person. What would you do if you picked up a book where someone is being teased about their looks and @CAPS3? Sure, one joke can make everyone laugh, but when one person is not very fond of you, well, that says a lot. Different genres of characteristics include being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are criticized and teased relentlessly because they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased. Books based on @CAPS4, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisance because they segregate people. I have written this to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books. So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves. We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke. Where would the world be today if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics? Do not take the books off the shelf. Maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be like, with all its diversity and differences.
848	3825	2	3	It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them, and they've made no such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works might be found offensive to some audiences, but I firmly believe all people should have access to the knowledge they wish to acquire. These works they wish to condemn and banish are the results of passion and hard labor. What I've noticed is that the materials they view as compromising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt expressions of creativity. And I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than just those works that are banished. It denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something fundamental - our own ability to express ourselves. The capabilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display its functions are often limited. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us, and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exploration of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our literature, and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a hasty decision. Just because of a few hurt feelings? Or a few tears shed due to some misunderstood language? Out of a lack of understanding? I think not. In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to convey, and I firmly stand against this censorship. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms, and I believe we can accomplish great things together. So let's spread the word and defeat this repression of expression, ensuring that the library remains a place where all forms of knowledge and creativity can thrive.
849	3826	2	3	Knowledge @CAPS1. Have you ever removed something that could be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither have I, and I don't believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controlling how people think, which is known as communism. Also, anything can be found offensive by one group of people, and so everything could be considered offensive and removed. Then libraries would cease to exist. What about in the courtroom? If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials could leave people in a bored and mindless state of mind. Do you want the government controlling what you think? I didn't think so. In the @LOCATION1, modern - day @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 did just that. He decided exactly what went in and out of people's minds. He did this by deciding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like the things you can find at the library, right? We can't have the government controlling what we think, and most libraries are government - run. If we let them decide what we read and listen to, that's the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom. Let's say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism and how it has supposedly 'helped' the nation. Then, at the same time, an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 woman goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the man's book banned, and the man wants the woman's book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, whether you just glance at it or look at it too closely. Plus, if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offensive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. No one is left happy. If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendant gets to present their case to make it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? You're going to go to jail, most likely as an innocent person, and you'll be marked as a murderer for the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be'sentenced' to 'death' without a 'fair trial.' So, if you want to have an un - @CAPS4, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because no one, except the writer, knows exactly what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. That's what the freedom we have is all about.
850	3827	2	3	A library is a place where you can rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to carefully select and check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. It isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them, then they shouldn't go to the area in the library that contains the offensive materials. In my own personal opinion, it doesn't really matter to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library, then you should be a certain age to rent it or read it. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone who is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be allowed to have it. Another opinion of mine on this subject is that if these kinds of materials offend someone, then they could simply avoid that area of the library. Instead, the person can walk around this section of the library or they could just not pay attention to the materials. The library could set aside a specific part of the library just for these kinds of materials, so that people, especially children, don't have to see them. Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials, then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough, then they will find a way to do it, or in this case, the child will see something that they want to see. If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library, then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials. If they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive, then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satisfy parents. If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves, then they would lose business. So, in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials, and without customers, they have no money, which means they are unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep a close eye on what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries. These kinds of materials should just have appropriate rules in place to ensure that everyone can co - exist in the library environment.
851	3828	2	3	To begin with, a woman might read a book about wives and find it offensive. However, it was her conscious choice to pick up the book and start reading it. So, should it be taken off the shelf? No, there's no reason for that. Different people have different perspectives on what they're reading, and not all people will feel the same way. The same thing applies to music, movies, magazines, etc. For instance, someone might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. But it was their choice to pick it up and read it. No one forced them at gunpoint to 'read the book etc.'   @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population to consider. Some might love it, some might just like it, and there will be those who don't. You can't just focus on that one person; you have to think about everybody else. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive, then they should have chosen more wisely in the first place and/or never should have picked what they did. It's their own fault.   For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off the shelf just because it's offensive. Just don't read the book and so on. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who find things offensive might be looking at it in the wrong way. We should keep the book etc., on the shelf. If they start taking things off, then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive. Then what will we be able to read or listen to?
852	3829	2	3	There is much censorship that occurs in the world. Music on the radio, television shows, or the internet is all subject to censorship. In today's society, the library is often a forgotten wonder to most, becoming a somewhat secluded world. The library is a place where one's mind can freely explore and discover as much as it desires. The library should not be a place of restricted discovery, unlike on the television or the internet. Censorship in libraries should be non - existent. People learn from books; books with happy endings, sad endings, and gruesome endings can all provide valuable lessons for the reader.   Many say that history repeats itself. Therefore, history is taught in schools so that the bad events that occurred in history can be prevented. This is the same for the books that are on library shelves. When reading a book, the reader is able to experience the lives of the characters as if they are living alongside them. Through the experiences of the characters, the reader gets to observe all the things done wrong and right by that character without actually living through the experience. By the end of the book, the reader will have new views on life and will try to avoid making the same mistakes as the characters in the book.   A major fear among parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that might be described in books. To be blatantly honest, there is foul language and inappropriate doings in this world. It is much better to have it discovered gradually through reading and maybe a few life experiences, rather than having it all thrown in one's face at once. The censoring that occurs on the radio and television is understandable, but when someone wants to improve themselves by reading, they should be able to read whatever they feel like.   A library is a place of wonderful learning, but if there is censorship, it restricts one's learning. Through reading, one is able to experience life without the consequences of actually experiencing it. All books are capable of being learned from, and they should all have the opportunity to be learned from. In conclusion, we should strive to keep libraries a place of free and unrestricted learning.
853	3830	2	3	Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experience, to read or listen to what we want. Who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read, or even listen to?   As an avid reader of all kinds of literature, I can't stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want to open up their minds to new ideas and different ways of life. The so - called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read. As Americans, we should be able to read what we want, whether it is offensive or not.   If you want to put certain restrictions on a book such as an age limit, I can understand that. But to completely take them off the shelves means we are losing our greatest right as an American citizen. To read, watch, or listen to other media is a great way to learn about things beyond what is in our immediate surroundings.   I understand some censorship in music and television. I don't want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the 'F - bomb' or seeing anything obscene. But these days, it's getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to, seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.   Many kids today have access to the internet, which can be both good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene, then they have the right to put certain blocks on their computer. Kids these days mainly use two kinds of media, which are the internet and music. But a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible, whether it be fiction, classics such as 'The Huck Finn and The Tom Sawyer', or educational literature.   So, are our reading choices becoming scarce? Yes, I believe so. And it all has to do with censorship. We can't read some of the classics because they're 'racist' or are 'pornographic', but you have to understand that for the time they were written, they weren't. So let everyone read what they want when they want, and in this way, we can preserve our freedom of choice in reading.
854	3831	2	3	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' No, I do not believe that just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does. Everyone has a different opinion; we're all unique individuals. We need a variety of all books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Censorship can be understandable in some ways, but without a wide variety, everyone would have fewer choices.   Your opinions, decisions, and outlook on life are one of a kind. How can you tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book? It just doesn't make sense. If individuals didn't have options of choices, there would be no real entertainment. In my opinion, if someone has such a problem with a certain topic, subject, etc., then they should just leave it alone. It's a big world, and there are many other people with different opinions. We should be open - minded!   Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt. It just goes to show that no one's opinion is absolutely right or wrong. Individuals should all have their individuality. Without variety, how can that be possible? From music, books, magazines, movies, etc., disagreements are inevitable, but in questions like this, we have to agree to disagree. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and keep a wide range of materials available for people to choose from.
855	3832	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censorship in the library. This is a very tricky subject because no one will ever be completely happy. All books, music, movies, magazines, etc. can be considered offensive to someone.   When it comes to books in the library, we should have sections. One for adult, child, family, activity, romance, etc. If we have those sections, then it would reduce the number of inappropriate books that children might look at. One time I went to the library and accidentally wandered into the adult books section. I knew that I was not supposed to go into that section, but if they had clearly marked it as the adult books section, then I would not have gone in there.   Parents need to monitor what their kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into. If a child wanders into the romance section, then they are going to see that kind of book. It's not the library's fault or even the fault of the writer. If the parent does not want to monitor what the child looks at, they could set boundaries. They could say 'Do not leave this section.' If my mom said that to me, I would stay around the child books. The parents can play an active role in solving this problem.   Libraries need to decide what kind of books they are going to have in the library. If the library does not have the kind of books you don't want your child to see, then your child can't look at that book. If your public library does keep those books in the open, the parents could always go to a town hall and tell the mayor, librarian, or other town people about the inappropriate books. If you tell people the library has that kind of books, then others will stand up against the books.   If you do not like what the library has on the shelves, suggest sections for the books, keep an eye on what your kids look at, or tell someone who can do something about the problem. What are you going to do to improve your public library? How are you going to prevent your kids from looking at the books you don't want them to see? By taking these steps, we can strike a balance between access to diverse materials and protecting children from inappropriate content.
856	3833	2	3	Bad @CAPS1 @CAPS2 off yes, I do think think they should be removed if they are bad. If you wouldn't say it to your parents' face when you're at a younger age, then you don't need to be listening to it or reading it. I would not want my younger kids reading or watching anything that they know they couldn't say to my face. There are so many things that little kids can see. Like at any @LOCATION1 or anywhere there are magazines with ladies in their bras and underwear, and it's the same thing with the guys. I don't think it's right that they should put them up where it isn't so easy for the little ones to see. Those kind of things are just going to get kids asking questions that make the parents have to lie. Then there's kids watching TV, and they have the stupid cartoons where the kids are cussing and talking about sex. Then your kid goes to that channel when you're not around and hears all this stupid stuff. Then they're going to go tell their friends what they heard because they think it's cool, then all kinds of kids are hearing it. When you can just take channels like that off your TV and make everything easier. I think the worst is when people sing about killing people and raping kids and all this and that. I would never let my kids listen to music like that, I don't care how old they are. I also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up is from the music they want to listen to. It's horrible. I would do anything to make it so kids couldn't listen to that stuff until their parents didn't care. I know my parents didn't like me listening to it when I was young, and I see why now that I'm older and know what all of it means. So I'm never going to let my kids listen to it when they are at a young age. In all that I hope that I made a good point and hope you feel the same way. Why let our kids listen to the stuff that hurts them and us in the long run? It's just not worth the trouble letting them do what they want when we can take simple steps to protect them.
857	3834	2	3	I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to. Anything publicly exposed is going to be seen anyhow. I think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something too mature or @ORGANIZATION1 for themselves. If it is a child, I think the parent shall be in charge of that decision, not the librarian. Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. People read @ORGANIZATION1 material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. Everyone loves entertainment, but to put a limit on it is unfair. If it is public, that means it should be released under certain circumstances, considering age and maturity. Regardless of whether it's in a book or magazine, everything that you don't want people to see will always show up somewhere else, such as on TV or the internet. The public library is where people go to get books to learn more about something. So if you take that book off the shelf, someone might miss out on an education about something. I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that a child gets that book so that they have knowledge about some things that are out there. If it's there to read, then let it be read instead of hiding it from them. It only makes children more anxious to read or see it. If it's in a public library, let it be read. People and children shall be free to access anything in the library unless otherwise consented by a parent. Anything publicly exposed in a book, magazine, or movie will be shown on the internet or TV, so children will see what they want, whether elders agree to it or not. Nudity, profanity, violence, and provocative material are in everything nowadays, even cartoons. So there is no way of keeping it from children or people. It's a part of everyday living. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of choice and let the appropriate parties, like parents, make decisions about what children can access.
858	3835	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style. Over the years, many well - written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library. 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive. These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader. While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it. However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct. 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book. Throughout the book, there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some. However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong. Books like this should be saved for older generations to read. However, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it. None - the - less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response. Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'? Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way. They are a tool of knowledge. Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge. Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others. Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written. '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story. How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books? They often state that it is their favorite book of all time. If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it. Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions. How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp? If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons. In conclusion, we should preserve the freedom of reading and let students and readers make their own choices.
859	3836	2	3	I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons @MONTH1 not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read. I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used in the way it was meant to be used, as a resource for knowledge. All offensive items a library @MONTH1 have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the shielding nature of others. In conclusion, libraries should uphold their role as a place of free access to knowledge, and censorship should not impede the pursuit of learning.
860	3837	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be mandated. Censorship should not block the 'allegory' in some books where the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader. Censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 just like in @DATE1. You couldn't understand the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art. The word definition of allegory is a story within a story. It is where the author is trying to convey something to the reader. For example, in the book '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2' is an allegory. It shows many stories tying in with each other. When @ORGANIZATION3 dies on the side of the cliff by @CAPS3 when he launches the huge rock overboard, that shows the fall of man. In the @CAPS4 where @CAPS5 eats the apple from the tree, and that is why we sin. You just cannot censor such a great book. Very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other. Everyone needs to look at both sides of the story. People need to know the true meaning of what is being said. Art should not be censored at all. Art is what makes people creative. The way artists make things abstract can kindle some controversy. Also, they make things that we use today that we just don't think about, that are utilitarian. Who would give you the right to censor their masterpieces? For example, @ORGANIZATION2 had a dark period in his work and painted demons in his paintings, and people might think that is way too graphic. People need to see why he painted such works based on what was going on during his life at that time. Censorship is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This would lead to a book called '@DATE1' by @PERSON1. In his book, he shows complete government @ORGANIZATION1. We as the people of our government would be classified as the '@CAPS6'. The @CAPS6 made the majority of the people and were not very smart people. Also, they could not think for themselves because the @ORGANIZATION1 censored everything you could think of. The @ORGANIZATION1 did this because they didn't want anyone to try to be a rebel and overthrow the @ORGANIZATION1. They knew that @CAPS6 could overthrow them, but they were on top of their game and censored everything. This is what would happen if we censored everything. We all would have no personality at all. No one could express love the way we do now. Censorship in libraries would not be the best thing anyone should do. No one would know what an author would be leading to, not a single artist could display their art. Also, censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This could not work in our society today. So, censorship is not the best idea anyone could think of. In conclusion, we should embrace the freedom of expression in libraries and art, as it is essential for a vibrant and diverse society.
861	3838	2	3	All of us can vividly think of or have that one particular book that we read and sincerely hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf. Well at least I know for sure I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'. I, myself personally firmly feel that this book should be removed from the shelves because for the simple yet significant fact it is over - rated and contains an excessive amount of violence and sex. A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called, '@CAPS1'. It was a seemingly good book but it was also extremely explosive in its content. The book was mainly about this teen who had a truly rough childhood and was desperately trying to make it through high school while being deeply engaged in an abusive relationship, succumbing to peer pressure, and having an addiction to sex and drugs. This book was highly exposing and very detailed, in which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book. I firmly feel sex and violence shouldn't be displayed in books or any other type of media. In conclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the shelves of the library unless they are issued to someone eighteen or older.
862	3839	2	3	I am writing to the newspaper, specifically about the issue of removing certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more. I truly don't think this should be allowed. I don't think it would be fair to others. I'm going to give you three solid reasons why you shouldn't let people just remove stuff like that off of shelves. The first reason is that, what if you had a child and sincerely wanted him or her to see the same movie or book you did when you were little? But they took it off the shelves. That would be incredibly sad and you would earnestly want them to see the movie or book you did but they can't. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The second reason is, what if you and your wife or husband had a favorite song, but they took it off the shelves? That would be absolutely devastating, it would just break your heart. Well I know it would break mine if it was our wedding song. The last reason and my favorite reason is, you just have your own opinion. Everyone has their own opinion, if you don't want to see them or look at them just don't do it. It's as easy as that, just try to ignore it. It's really not your problem to worry about. Those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we let this happen everyone will take advantage of it. That is why I am firmly against letting people remove anything off of any shelves.
863	3840	2	3	Should we censor books in libraries? Katherine Paterson, an esteemed author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This provides a very valid point. If we start taking off books that we find offensive, there will be none left. Books are meant to provide in - depth information and valuable insight into someone's life. If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter at all. The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity. Books provide unique insight into the author's life. Also, the things that are happening in history significantly affect the author's tone or style, like @ORGANIZATION1. During his lifetime, @CAPS2 was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to carefully appease the @LOCATION1. It also helped appeasing the @LOCATION1 since he was sponsoring @ORGANIZATION1's plays. Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be @CAPS3. He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly witnessed oppressive things like serfs. When he wrote his tales, he made the high - class people sort of mean while he made the lower - caste people on the humbler side. @CAPS3 was not afraid to displease the @LOCATION1. If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson said. Where one might find information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa. Every book would have someone say it was offensive. It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it; it does not matter. Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive. However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books. It builds the tone and mood of the story or character. It might create a certain vivid image. It also teaches us not to do what these people are doing. The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life. These stories teach us life lessons. Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like it does not mean someone else does not. It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it. I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me. It revolves us as a whole, and if someone starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same. It would not be fair. Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity. It would also make them think that their ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them. I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone. I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society. Books are important to have. They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience. It is important to be aware of what is going on around you. I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occurring in society. My parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society. Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like. So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up. I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after. Unfortunately most do not, but there are some that have a happy life. That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad. So @PERSON2 was wise in her observation. Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this process has started?
864	3841	2	3	Books, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves. For many long years, people would come to the library for them. Some of these materials may be vulgar as well as offensive, but there should be an age - check - out law. This should also be in consideration for this century's ways. There are many people who thrive off of the horrible things people put out into the world. They love to see the pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be an age limit to what certain age groups should read. Yes, there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lies with the parents. If there was an age limit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem. As well, we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book. If we had all of this then there would not be any more problems. It would be a nice, controlled library. So in conclusion, this is the way to go. This is the future of tomorrow.
865	3842	2	3	Let's think in today's well - known world, the children and teens have access to pretty much everything. If you ask a teenager this same question: should this stuff be taken off the shelves? They might say no. If you ask an adult, however, they are most likely going to say yes. The music that surrounds young adults and children isn't the best. Go ahead and listen, you will be truly amazed. If they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it. I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off. Now that's just my opinion. Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff. I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff. When you think about it, they have so many rights that they shouldn't have. If there is anything offensive then it should be taken off the shelves. They should be replaced with educational things. Let's go back to where it all began, back when everything started to come out. Did you have most of this stuff growing up? You probably didn't. But now you can find anything almost anywhere. Which is kind of sad if you ask me. Magazines, however, are starting to become more like movies and music. Mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show. If you look at athletes, it doesn't matter who it is, they get in trouble for things they shouldn't have said. They should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff. That right there will help out education and what not. You can become a more responsible adult by showing them what's right and what's wrong. Starting with what they listen to or what they watch. I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway. That's because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't when I was little. If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want, the odds are they might not do good in school. One way you can help out is by hanging out with the child or children. Even teens. Even though they don't want you to. Talk to them, make conversations, teach them right from wrong. When you teach a child right from wrong, the outlook on school will be better.
866	3843	2	3	When you are taking your little kid to the library because they're eager to get a book, you might think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library; it's all educational books.' @CAPS1, how would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You'd likely be okay with it since no one assumes there are bad images or inappropriate movies at the library.     A little girl could be with her mom in the adult section of the library, and they might come across some things you wouldn't want them to see. The romance books usually feature girls half - clothed and the guys in very little. A child could easily spot that and not understand what it means, but that image would stay in their head for a long time. Some of the kids could wander up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns.      It's not just the kids seeing such stuff; it's everyone. A teen could casually pick up a book and, not paying full attention, see content about the other gender. A couple could go into the library hoping to find a good, healthy, funny movie but might stumble upon a movie that makes them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from their era, but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even alcohol.     The magazines always have girls half - clothed, even in Seventeen magazine. The car magazines feature girls modeling in front of the cars to make them more appealing. You can get a baby magazine that shows a mom breast - feeding. You might have just wanted to look at it because of the babies, but you or your child don't want to see a mom breast - feeding.     The library is a very resourceful place, and you can obtain very good information about various things there. However, they also have some bad aspects. I think the music that talks about personal and bad things should be in its own separate area. The same goes for the magazines, movies, and books; they should all be in a room together, away from the rest of the items in the library. There should be an age limit to enter that room, and they should inform you about the type of content inside before you go in.     I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids, teens, or anyone. I just believe that certain books, music, and magazines should be stored in a different location instead of being out in the open where everyone can see them. This way, the library can maintain its educational value while protecting the sensibilities of all its visitors.
867	3844	2	3	Libraries are stocked full of all kinds of reading materials, such as books, magazines, and catalogs. But are all of these appropriate for the diverse crowd that frequents a library? My answer is no. However, should they be removed from the libraries? No. Although many kids visit libraries, so do many adults searching for good pieces of literature. That's why these books should remain available to most people.     When I was in the seventh grade, I recall reading a book, titled @PERSON2, about a child who had been sexually abused. I wish I had never picked up that book. Although it scared me greatly, it taught me a very valuable lesson. I learned at a young age to never associate with strangers. If it weren't for this novel, things could have turned out very differently. Therefore, I believe it's beneficial to expose children at a young age to small doses of real - life situations. Not everything in the world is as sugar - coated as @PERSON3 would argue.     From @CAPS1 to the Bible, there is a vast variety of literature. This variety offers stories for many different audiences. The libraries try their best to categorize these books so that younger children don't get their hands on the wrong ones. Instead of completely removing the books from the collection, another suggestion could be to implement a system similar to that for mature - rated video games and only allow people over the age of @NUM1 to check out certain books. This would make it extremely difficult for children to access inappropriate books.          Lastly, a suggestion could be to label inappropriate books, such as @CAPS2.Ds and movies. This could make a small but significant difference and make children think twice before opening a book labeled for mature audiences only. This way, stories are available for all, and small children are protected from magazines such as @CAPS3.          Like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I perceive that what she is trying to say is similar to my view. She wants all the books to be available, and kids should be steered away from inappropriate ones, with the hope that children can make the right decision when choosing a piece of literature. By following these suggestions, libraries can continue to be a place of learning and discovery for all ages.
868	3845	2	3	I think that if something is a problem for only some people and not everyone, why can't we just separate the items into sections? That way, there would be no problems.    I mean, why change something if only a few people dislike it? That would only lead to a big conflict. Think about it; if we were to try and give everyone exactly what they want, it wouldn't work out well at all. So, it would be better to limit things and put them in specific sections. This approach would ensure that everyone's needs and preferences are considered to some extent, without causing unnecessary disputes. By having separate sections, those who are bothered by certain items can avoid them, while others can still access what they like. In the end, this simple solution can help maintain the harmony and functionality of the place where these items are located.
869	3846	2	3	Censorship is a very sensitive topic. There are so many things people dislike, so they censor certain aspects, hiding the ideas from those who aren't aware of them. I personally detest censorship. I would rather the world be an educated place with minor dangers than a place where everything is kept secret and seemingly safe.     You must be thinking, 'There are some things we have to censor; certain topics can harm our children's minds.' But in truth, your children will find out about these things in the real world eventually anyway.  In reality, drugs, alcohol, sex, rape, violence, and all the other things you censor are common occurrences that your kids will hear about. Most children first hear about these topics in school, usually in elementary school, and if not, they will definitely find out in junior high. If they will eventually find out regardless, wouldn't it be better to let them find out the easy way?     Now you must be thinking, 'But if they find out too young, it could traumatize them.' That is a risk, but most teenagers are more traumatized when exposed to these topics without any prior knowledge. If they already know what they're dealing with, they would know how to react. However, if they have no knowledge of what's going on, they could make a major mistake without even realizing it. Once again, wouldn't it be better for them to find out from you or a book rather than finding out the hard way?     Now, you might be thinking, 'Our children must be protected; this knowledge could just put them in more danger.' It might put them in more danger; there's always a possibility. The world is full of possibilities, though, and anything could happen. This knowledge that you always hide from them might be what they need to know later on, and they won't know when they need it. What would they do if they see their friends start doing drugs, and since they have never heard of drugs, they don't know it's a bad thing to do? Or if they see older kids drinking and are offered a drink but don't know they shouldn't accept it? Or if they wind up kissing someone they like, and the situation goes too far, but they don't know what they're doing?      Anything could happen, and your children need to be prepared. If they don't know about these things, they can't tell if what they're doing is good or bad, and they might wind up getting in trouble or hurt. By sharing this knowledge in a proper way, we can help them make informed decisions and be better prepared for the real world.
870	3847	2	3	As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 as a young girl, I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book. Being a girl who likes reading magazines, I opened it. I soon realized it was a book I would never actually read. I felt embarrassed and wondered why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored. I think that censorship in libraries and bookstores is a good thing. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents' responsibility. A @NUM1 - year - old girl should not be able to access an inappropriate movie, magazine, or book whenever she wants. We need to teach them ourselves. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to discover who they are, rather than conforming to what the world wants them to be.  Censoring the books helps keep small children'sheltered'; they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up at their own pace. The movies that are made present a false view of what sex and intimacy really are.      You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too. Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 acts like that, so should I. The magazine industry really harms children in the long run. They feature super - skinny models in barely - there bikinis. Sports @CAPS3 prides itself on that. Maxim has the '@CAPS4 @NUM2' with a bunch of @CAPS8 lying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that it's @CAPS4 and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like. They get the @CAPS5 magazines and drool over how the center - fold looks. Allowing small children to see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way. It makes them believe that if you dress like this when you get older, you can attract all the boys.      Today, there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 things to try in bed tonight that a child could simply walk by and see. Many of these books have images showing how to do this and that. This can really make a child and their parent(s) feel very uncomfortable. When you go to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 or any bookstore, they have a relationship, love section filled with such books. Many young people might think, 'Love, oh, I bet that's @CAPS7 or a @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 book.' They see the cover that intrigues them, thinking, 'Oh, this girl is pretty.' Censoring these books can relieve the concerns of kids and parents. The kids can grow up the way they should.      Now, movies give a very false impression of what sexual intercourse really is. They show people doing all these things, and kids think that it's normal and there's nothing to worry about. But here's the truth: sex is not just about fun. When you have sex, you have to ensure you are safe. This isn't just a game. In @LOCATION1 today, many young @CAPS8 are raped. The movies don't show this. Many young @CAPS8 as young as five are affected by the trauma of being raped, yet we allow pornography to be made. Pornography is false; @CAPS8 don't just look at each other and get turned on. Sex is never that simple. By censoring the movies, kids won't form a wrong idea before they truly learn and understand what sex really means and entails.      Censoring is something that I strongly believe in. To this day, my parents still make sure the movies we choose are appropriate. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait. By putting those movies and books in a separate area, it gives parents the opportunity to teach their kids, and it gives the kids time to grow and develop a proper understanding of these sensitive topics. In this way, we can protect the innocence of children while still allowing them to access appropriate knowledge as they mature.
871	3848	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote, ''If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'' This quote highlights an important aspect of freedom of speech. Having the right to do something is almost a part of freedom of speech. It's about believing in the decision or choice you have made. If I were to reflect on my views on censorship in libraries, we all would have that same opportunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included. There could be inappropriate books in the library that we absolutely would not want our younger siblings reading. The best thing is to ask ourselves: Should we have the right to take away our kids' freedom and right to read, listen to, and access updated media and publications when we had it? Should we really put a censorship on the libraries? I feel that censoring a library would not be necessary considering a library is a manual guide of history. Our libraries are organized from A to Z in authors' names, separated into non - fiction and fiction. CDs are separated in one section, movies in another, and there are also sections for magazines, with adult books and children's books separated in different areas. Libraries all across the world have had a kid who might have chosen a book that was not appropriate for them to read, but what kid hasn't? What would a book hurt them when there are plenty of bad influences, peer pressure, violence, and sexual publicity everywhere, and especially in the media. It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books. I feel no, we should not take away our children's learning opportunities. Growing up as a kid, I loved being able to go to the library. It helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling, and I learned plenty of new words. The books I read growing up weren't perfectly clean, but I could relate to a lot of the books I chose as a kid. So, no, I feel we should not censor libraries. We need them to be a fun place for our children and us to go to for learning, fun, comfort, and more. We can't take that from our generation; it just would not be right.
872	3849	2	3	Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you found offensive, more than likely someone else will also find it offensive. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, we can reduce potential problems before they even happen. Nowadays, more than ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now. One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derogatory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and giving them the impression that since it's in a library, it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, children are going to look up to that and more than likely do those things, which could end up harming themselves or others. If the government provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our government doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our government for support and answers, how would we feel if they had no judgment about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care, and that might cause panic throughout the country, which would cause many more problems than needed. It would be an easier thing just to censor our libraries. If our libraries weren't filled with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than leading them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things, I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for. When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex positions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So, by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will it calm down some of the problems that are re - occurring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely. In conclusion, library censorship is a necessary step to protect our children and promote a more positive and educational environment.
873	3850	2	3	There is a lot of different things that can be offensive to all sorts of people. So, if we started taking things off TV or out of books and magazines, we would be constantly taking stuff out. If it's too graphic for kids, put it in the adults' area. Would censorship be the answer to take out such content? No. We need to be more aware of where our children are, and there would be fewer problems. If we made changes to the age limits on movies, we might be even better off. If parents were to watch the movie first, then the parents would be able to tell their children what's okay and what's not. We need to put more true historical content in movies and make them engaging so that we could be teaching kids more useful things. The music should be censored to some extent, especially rap. There is a lot of rap music that should be cleaned up so that little kids don't hear it. There might even be a better way to control this stuff so that little kids can't get a hold of it. We can have teachers help tell the kids and let them know that it's not right for them to watch or listen to certain content. We also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on TV. There are some that need to be cleaned up. There are also a lot of different preferences among people. Then there are some who don't care about it either. Maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to better manage the content that children are exposed to. In conclusion, rather than relying solely on censorship, a combination of parental awareness, teacher guidance, and content improvement can help create a safer media environment for children.
874	3851	2	3	A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well, I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something, whether it's related to careers or being able to learn new things. Magazines may not be as helpful as books in many aspects, but they are something to entertain you. Music is not just something you listen to; it's something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. Movies can have a certain impact on someone. A lot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying. No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there just for you to read, listen to, or watch. Those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a person's life. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of schools or even the public libraries. The more people read, watch, or listen to these things, the better they will understand life. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. It's really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading. That's why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means, then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world. In conclusion, all forms of media in libraries play an important role in our lives, and we should embrace and make the most of them.
875	3852	2	3	A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children, they have a nice, comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults, they have coffee tables, sofa seats, and many different amenities while they read their books. Never should a library have to disclose certain materials because of the ages of the people who come in and out. Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library, they should go to their specific areas for which they came. They should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids wouldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it anyway. The library is a public place and is made for all ages. Even though there are bookstores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't be removed from a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes, even in libraries. The world is full of offensive things, period. Now, while a child is not within a library, they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach their children right from wrong, there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library, I personally would not mind having all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain extent in my selection of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be there, but at the same time, I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no, I don't think they should remove certain books just because children are in the library. In conclusion, libraries should remain inclusive spaces, and it's the responsibility of parents and guardians to guide children rather than relying on censorship.
876	3853	2	3	Censorship. When was the last time someone told you what you could, and couldn't do? Especially if it was something you didn't want to do. How'd that make you feel? You probably didn't want to do it, did you? Censorship is somewhat the same way. The other day, my friends and I wanted to go see a new movie that just came out. We weren't allowed to see it though. You know why? Due to censorship, we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie. So, now the only way we'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us. Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends to a movie? It doesn't go so well, does it. Censorship violates freedom of being different. You can't listen to music, watch movies, or even read certain books, unless you're of a certain age. That's not fair. Censorship is like a modern - day dictator. It tells you what you can and can't do, how you can dress, and what to say. Everybody would be the same then. How did the dictator do with his idea? He failed miserably. How do you think the oppressed victims felt? They were punished for believing, or doing something different. They weren't hurting anybody; they just wanted to live their lives a different way. That's what censorship is doing, classifying people into certain groups, telling them what they can and can't see, do, or listen to. That's what makes the world different, people that are different. Don't make everyone be the same; we should cherish our diversity and oppose unnecessary censorship.
877	3854	2	3	Everyone has different views on works of literature, whether it be books, magazines, movies, or music. If libraries were to remove this stuff from the shelves, then they would be losing business. They would be losing customers, especially children, and they would be taking away the reason for these items being on the shelves in the first place. These libraries would be losing business from the people who might like the kind of stuff that some others may not. The people running the business might decide to take out older pieces of work that could potentially offend younger people in this generation. The content written, sung, or played in these things might seem to harm these people, but that is not what it is there for. The things that might seem harmful are in there to show people in the younger generations how life was lived in the older days, such as the era of slaves. This would also have an impact on children who use this library. If this literature was taken out, children might think that things have always been the way they are as they see it. If these children grew up and were to see a book, hear a song, or watch a movie about how things were in the olden days, and how much it has changed, then they might never believe it because they were not taught as children. As they are older, they might still never have the interest to learn about these types of things because they never knew about them growing up. These things are written to teach people and children about how things used to be; they are not used to harm people. When people take these things as harmful, they are not getting the true meaning that the author had in mind when they wrote them. Libraries should keep these pieces of literature on their shelves, only to teach young people of what the world has come from, how their older relatives lived, and what they came from. In this way, libraries can fulfill their educational purpose and preserve cultural heritage.
878	3855	2	3	I feel that there should be censorship in libraries. Children shouldn't be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to. This could save people from getting in trouble and reading the wrong stuff. There should be censorship in libraries. I feel that there should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy. For example, there are age - restricted items in bookstores and video rental stores. One other reason that I feel that there should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wrong way. When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldn't be reading or watching, you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it might be. That's why if we had censorship, they wouldn't have a chance to do so. Another reason I say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something, then you shouldn't have it freely accessible in the library. As you can see, these are the reasons that I feel we should have censorship in libraries. With censorship, nobody will feel left out, and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same. They already have bookstores and online sites where you can buy books and movies, and they have no censorship, but you just have to be a certain age and have a credit card. That way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card. So, with that being said, I feel there should be censorship in libraries to protect the young and maintain a proper public environment.
879	3856	2	3	The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading for pleasure, and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want, and sometimes it might offend others, but there's nothing you can really do about it. Sometimes there might be inappropriate books at the library or the supermarket, but even if it doesn't apply to you, it might to someone else. For instance, say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual, and you don't think it should be allowed, but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it. Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things. In some ways, they might be okay with it because in a book it might show the reader how bad they are for you and that you shouldn't do them. I know I like reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes people's lives up, and I don't want to live like that. There are some things I don't think should be allowed, like books, magazines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think it's right for people to talk about others just because their skin is a different color. They have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like ADHD or Down syndrome and other kids bullying them because it's not their fault they're like that, and it's just inappropriate. Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others, and sometimes they write them for that purpose. And even though we might complain about them, no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech, and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inappropriate things at the library you don't like or don't want your children to see, then don't let them go. We should respect others' freedom of expression while also being aware of the potential harm of offensive content.
880	3857	2	3	"I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images. But that brings up the question about racism. Almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them, such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". That book uses the N - word to describe African - Americans, but when that book was published, that was common talk. Now, people look at you like you have just murdered their first - born child if you were to use that word. For the most part, though, books are not all that offensive, at least none of the books I read. I know that there are books and magazines such as ""Playboy"" and ""Maxim"" that are offensive to women and have probably caused a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that. I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that, but they are a small percentage of the kids. I know that during the Nazi regime over in Germany, many books were banned because they had something to do with Catholicism or something that Hitler believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race. I know that for a short time, a lot of what Harper Lee wrote was banned for using the N - word, but people have to realize that when Harper Lee was alive, that was everyday language. As for me being Catholic, there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good Catholic. I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list, but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list. I can see how some of those books could be banned. As for music, I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place. I know that all of the rap genre is what my generation is into, even though I don't see why kids like that kind of music. I also think that music produced by the Aryan Brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because their music is overtly racist. I don't think that movies should be banned from the libraries because of violence or anything of that nature. I do think that the movie should be banned if it contains anything of the nature of pornography, but they do not let those kinds of movies in the libraries anyway, so they are a step ahead of me. I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said. If I have those rights to ban things, then everyone else does too, and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive, then someone else will find something else offensive, and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves. My view of what I think is offensive is very relaxed compared to others. We need to strike a balance between freedom of access to information and protecting against truly offensive and harmful content."
881	3858	2	3	The @CAPS1 Materials     Have you ever come across a well - written book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know? My stance on the censorship of materials that may cause offense in libraries is that they should not be taken off the shelves. People should have their own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read? My opinion is that materials that might be offensive to certain individuals should not be removed but put in a specific section clearly marked as adult material, including books, music, movies, etc.     I myself have had the experience of not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The movie was based on the book called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, and it was just full of exciting action/adventure. This was very unfair in my eyes; just because I was young, I couldn't check out a certain movie. This experience led me to firmly hold the opinion that materials that might show certain offense to someone should not be removed.      Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is that many people have different interests. No one is going to have the same interests all the time. So, taking materials away only helps one person but hurts many by depriving them of something they might be interested in. I can understand that people have had different experiences and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. However, I think all materials are not the same; they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials for other people to choose from.     In conclusion, I firmly believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason is that what might be offensive to an individual could be very interesting to another person. As the saying from the ebony magazine goes, 'another person's junk might be someone else's treasure,' which I think is very apt for this topic.
882	3859	2	3	I do not feel these types of things should be taken off the shelves. What I think is that things should come with a proper rating because this is a free country, and for someone to do something like removing items would be taking away someone's freedom of speech. Many people have fought in the past for simply the freedom of speech. I think that if people rate the things that come out, then they will not end up in the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 off the market when it first came out because it has violence in it, profane language, and guns. That company would have lost a lot of money because it is inappropriate for kids. I think that parents shouldn't buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 - year - old something like that, but some parents do. It's not the creators' fault for the actions of how people react to whatever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responsible and make sure that whatever it is is supervised and carefully monitored. There's an old saying 'everything isn't made for everybody.' I strongly believe that; that saying is so true. Everybody doesn't like the same thing that someone else likes, but it's okay for that person but not okay for you because, as they say, everything isn't for everybody, and you can't force anything on someone. Well, everything isn't appropriate for everyone; we all have our limits to everything. If you watch what kids watch and do, then things won't be so inappropriate for this world. Certain books young children should not read because they have sex in them and talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age. When children read books like that, they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel, but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff. That's why it's their parents' responsibility to monitor what their children read because that's their job as parents, not the person who wrote the book. They might think they're writing to a much older group that can relate to what they're talking about, but then again, they're just speaking their mind and exercising their freedom of speech right, one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for. I also feel that music helps us to express ourselves, so if someone feels that the music is inappropriate for their child, then they need to watch what their child is listening to. Music brings out different moods in everybody. All magazines are not for everyone because, as we all know, there are adult magazines that produce certain imagery that children should not see. But you can't blame the creator; only the buyer is at fault for leaving it in the wrong place after they're done with it. They're just people trying to make money off things that they know people like.
883	3860	2	3	Don't you hate it when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all reach that point in our lives, whether we're constant readers or not. As the quote by Katherine Paterson, an author, goes, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                         If you ask me, I think there should be a certain authority regarding these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 people sign it, then the book could be removed. All of this applies to music, movies, magazines, even bibles in libraries.      I'm not saying we should make a law that if one person doesn't like something, then nobody should have the right to have it. But as a public, if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something, then maybe it's best that we don't. We all worry about our children, constantly keeping an eye on them to make sure they're not getting into something they're not supposed to be in. The same goes for books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles.     Now, don't get me wrong. I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and tries to check out an 'inappropriate' book, the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute. That doesn't mean the child can't go into the library, find a book, and just read it there. There's also the scenario where, mind you, it might not be your child, but with today's crime records, this is very probable. The child could grab a book, magazine, or even a film and just steal it.     In the long run, there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1' rated books or films, but just a place where we can keep all the books we don't think children should be reading. Still, we should definitely have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will, but this is my opinion of library censorship, and hopefully, it's yours now too.
884	3861	2	3	Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like. Libraries are organized for a purpose; what I like is my preference. You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has their own taste.     Books, movies, music, and magazines are created for people to look at, read, watch, etc. People have preferences and like to have them available when they want. Libraries are great for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen to. And other people should not get offended by what others like.     Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that section, then you can ask for it to be removed to another section. But don't think something is offensive and have it removed just because you don't like it. How is that fair to others who might like it?     If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok,' then it's okay for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has their own taste. Don't be offended by what others like. In the end, we should respect the diversity of preferences in a library environment.
885	3862	2	3	Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children to the elderly, and therefore, there is material to suit all ages. When you go to a library, you expect that no matter what kind of book you want to read, they will have it. Whether it's for personal preferences or school research projects, libraries should have a wide range of materials, right? Well, some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. This is because of the individual differences of the people who go to the library. Someone from an extremist religion group could be going there to read about something related to their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 were to find a book on the extreme religion, they could be offended. However, this situation could go both ways. Due to the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs, we are all going to appreciate and depreciate different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are large enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non - fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the child's fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult - orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs come different views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book, while others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book can mean something totally different to one person than to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the children's books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that clearly warns readers about the content of the material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are written for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all affect the way you respond to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you depends on your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books on a certain subject could upset people who like that type of book or it could even be relevant to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowledge. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someone's opportunity to read about a subject be revoking the author's freedom of speech? Just because a book has a controversial subject or a mature topic doesn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else decides is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A library's interior could be arranged so that young children aren't likely to find a book about sex near their kids' books. Taking away certain books related to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance, a place where someone can read about anything they want, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read. In conclusion, libraries should strive to maintain a diverse collection that respects the rights and interests of all patrons.
886	3863	2	3	I believe everyone has the right to voice their own opinion on life. If we censor one's books, music, or movies because they are inappropriate, it would be like silencing an opinion that stands out among the others. After all, these forms of expression often carry unique perspectives. If we silence the author and their story or song, how will we be able to view life from another person's view? In the @ORGANIZATION1, we have the freedom of speech and press. These amendments make it so that others can voice an opinion without being shot down. Although we have the amendments, there are still restrictions on what we are allowed to publish. Say we found a diary written by @PERSON1. Are we allowed to view his deepest, darkest thoughts? Or are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes? His ideas are different, but does that mean we shouldn't show them? No, we should show them. We need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life. I believe that no matter whose ideas they are, if allowed by the author, they should be allowed to be read and comprehended in our own way. If one wishes to learn about how to murder in a @CAPS1, then I think they should be allowed to do so. The reason is that the @CAPS1 is becoming obsolete; the technology era is officially here. There is not a thing we can't find in @CAPS1 that can't be found online. Although the @CAPS1 is a government - run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials they want to view the censored media. It is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a @CAPS1, a child could find it. But like the internet, you can block things from those kids. All voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biased, or just insane. These are ways to view the perspective or the reason behind hate and war. If we can learn from other mindsets through books, music, movies, then I think we should be allowed to. Nothing should be blocked from the public. Everyone has the right to voice their own opinion in their own way, and by allowing all forms of expression, we can foster a more understanding and informed society.
887	3864	2	3	KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF! I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library. If we did that, then there wouldn't be any books left. The library is a place of diverse knowledge, and removing books would be a disservice to that purpose. The only thing we should be worried about is the rated @CAPS2 movies. Yeah, those can be taken out of the library. If one book is offensive to someone, then don't get it, but someone else might like that book. For example, an older woman is looking through this magazine, and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs or being half - naked. Although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip. We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre. There wouldn't be any categories left in the library. A good idea is to separate the books. Put the ones that seem offensive in the back. Keep the children's books away from the big mystery horror books. Another example is this. A student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavery, but there isn't any books on slavery because somebody thought it was offensive against African Americans. I understand that there are reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content. Children do not need to be around those kinds of books. Or some books being taken out because of religious beliefs, like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil or something. The movie situation I understand. I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing something that has a sex scene or drug content in it. You can take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf. Just because I want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf. Then the library's movie business would be over. To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't. Personally, I think that there should be a variety in the library. If not, everybody would get bored of the same books, over and over. KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF, as a diverse library enriches the community.
888	3865	2	3	Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read, that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience why I disagree with Katherine Paterson. In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she asked, 'Why is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her, to the best of my ability, the life of @CAPS6 and why this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about. It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others' beliefs or non - beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf, that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people, but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunately, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life. What if that book was not in the library to change another? We should keep all books in libraries to give everyone a chance at such life - changing experiences.
889	3866	2	3	I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material. It's a library, a place where people go to get information. A library is a repository of knowledge from all walks of life. If you don't want your kid or kids reading, watching, or listening to those kinds of material, then you shouldn't have to let them read, listen to, or watch any offensive material until they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it. It is a library, and they are going to have a wide variety of books. I don't think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or it's too gory or has too many curse words for your kid. Not everyone gets offended by the same things or the same material. If you do, then don't read that book or watch that movie, but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it. Libraries are made for the community and the people in it, not just one person. Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by. This is what I think on the censorship of books, movies, music, magazines, etc. It's a library; they are going to have a bunch of material. If you find something offensive, be mature, put it back and find something else to read, watch, or listen to. By allowing all types of materials, libraries can truly serve the diverse needs of the community.
890	3867	2	3	In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Many people @MONTH1 feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropriate for anyone to see/hear. Inappropriate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that @MONTH1 offend people. For instance, the words in songs can be offensive. Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence. I believe that, if a book, music, movies, or magazines upset you, then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular. If you have been to a library, you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways; and if you're an adult, then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you. I have been in a library a few times in my life. When I search for what I'm looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me. In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above. People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them. By maintaining a diverse collection, libraries can offer a wide range of perspectives and knowledge to all patrons.
891	3868	2	3	Whose to say what is truly appropriate for whom? Whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view, just like most things in life. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as not to stick forks in electrical outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being overly sheltered is not always a good thing, and censorship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridiculous and disrespectful to authors. In matters of censorship, I find it to be utterly pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except that they'll think “mother won't let me watch that”. It just keeps your kids more curious and more inclined to hide things from you. They'll feel like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. This causes children to go behind your back more, and when they're in trouble, you'll be their last place where they can ask for help, when you should be their first resort. No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. It's altering an author's work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library, and someone didn't like something about it, so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal, not required. Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children, will in most cases cause them to rebel, and in other cases, leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of telling them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language? Or make them feel like a bad person for doing something your grandparents did when they were young? I conclude that censorship is unjust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be a part of their life in some way. You don't go through every day in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or that everything is censored and everything is controlled. I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nurture, and it has no place in a free - thinking society.
892	3869	2	3	I believe that it is completely unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons. I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular stand out. First, it could be a book, a movie, or a magazine that someone has specifically planned on reading, and removing an item will surely let down the customer. Second, there are many practical solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some of the decisions a business decides to make. First, it could be a book, a movie, or a magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. People come to libraries with the intention of looking at what they're interested in to entertain themselves. There should be all types of literature in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike. Every time an item is removed off of a shelf, there will be an unsatisfied customer. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Libraries always have some type of organizational system. In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections. This solution will prevent anyone from accidentally seeing something that offends them. If that doesn't help, librarians should post a clear sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. A customer's needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own. If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items because they know what their readers like, then no one else should interfere. If I owned a library, I would be extremely upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business. In conclusion, I believe it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons. First, it could be a book, a movie, or a magazine that someone plans on reading. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. I believe I have expressed my opinion to the fullest. Although some people may disagree with the way I feel, I'm firmly sticking with it. There definitely wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons, and libraries would lose their value as a place of free access to knowledge.
893	3870	2	3	Newspaper company, I am writing to this company to explain why I think certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I am writing to tell you from my own experience and readings that will support my argument. I am reflecting my view on censorship in libraries. I am writing so you can hear me out on what I have to say and hopefully be persuaded by this essay. First, I think no book should be taken off any shelf of any library, regardless of people's thoughts on religious, race, or any other thing that has been offensive to anyone in the past. For example, take the topic of gay and lesbian marriage and people's thoughts and opinions on it. I believe that no one should disrespect anyone's opinion on what they have to say. It depends on what kind of language you're using for this type of subject. If it has harsh words and is supposed to be harmful, then yes, it should be removed. Another aspect is children taking books off shelves. Maybe you should accompany your child in the children's section and tell him or her what they should not do, like taking stuff down that they are not supposed to. What I'm saying is that if something is supposed to hurt others and is offensive, using negatively - charged words to harm others' feelings, it should be removed. My letter to you was to show you my opinion on what I think should be in a library or not. I have used some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what I think is right or wrong in this situation. I hope my topics and argument have convinced you on whether you should remove a book from a shelf. It's important to strike a balance between freedom of expression and protecting the feelings of others in the library environment. @ORGANIZATION1.
894	3871	2	3	Are there truly universally evil books that no one should read? Are good and bad no longer matters of opinion for the readers themselves? The answer is a resounding no. Censorship is a terrible practice masquerading as a boon. The right to read certain books should not be left to a conservative few, because everyone has their own unique opinion about everything. There is always something we can potentially learn from books, and it's never right to take that away. Freedom of speech should certainly come into play here as well, allowing the authors' words to be heard without interference from those who would dictate what we read. There is a reason libraries have many sections. They have to cater to the individual tastes of the masses, without regard to what other people find offensive. If one was to go through the library and burn every book they did not like, there would be scarcely anything left. Send in another person with different tastes, and then you have a completely empty library. It is far better to leave all the books alone so that everyone can find something to enjoy reading. Basically, there are bound to be people who have similar opinions to the author of just about anything, so allow the authors to share those opinions and let readers make their own choices. Then we have the knowledge portion of the issue. Offensive material to one person might be what another person wants or needs to read, whether for recreation or class. There is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing. Perhaps a restricted section would be in order if the problem would involve corruption of innocent minds, but a full - scale censor would never be necessary. Finally, there is an amendment in the Constitution of the United States for preventing censorship. It is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech, whether it be books, movies, music, or magazines. And what is more restrictive to an author than to have their books banned? The greatest difference between our country and a totalitarian government is the simple freedom allowed in the marketplace of ideas. If we start restricting that freedom, what are we then? We would be moving towards a society that suppresses the free flow of information and thought. In short, censorship is a harmful practice that should never be used. People all have their own opinions, all media can be learned from, and our freedom should not be restricted. The practice of censorship is what should truly be banned from the shelves, as it undermines the very foundation of a free and democratic society.
895	3872	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, It is difficult to determine where to draw the line on what kids should or should not see as far as the world is concerned. What makes kids behave better: being sheltered from life or being life - smart and knowing what is going on in this world? I think it's safe to say what we do or do not want our kids to do, say, etc. But in other terms, do we have full control of our kids? I know that this might sound weird, but I strongly believe in the simple fact that kids are being over - sheltered today! Our kids are growing up with the new technology. It's the century for computers, laptops, and gaming systems. Our kids don't know what it's like to go outside anymore. The world has so much to offer us, yet we turn it down because we see what all the new advances have to offer as well. I think it is very important to be both book - smart and street - smart. If you spend all your time doing one thing, you are going to end up lacking in one area. I believe grades will come as a result of a well - rounded education. I think that our kids are over - sheltered for the simple fact that when our kids see something that we don't want them to see, or they're not ready for it, then they're not allowed to see it. But who's to say on the days you're not watching them that they're not going to go into the real world and just see exactly what you didn't want them to! This is why it's important for you to teach your child what is going on in the world and not leave them in the dark. Also, we are living in the new age of life, where computers and laptops are the number one thing in the world right now for people to be using throughout the day. It is hard for kids to understand the realness of life since everything is done over the internet now. It is a privilege to be so far advanced in the world, yet we still don't know what to do! As we get older, we are not going to know nearly as much stuff as we need to be known and taught because as we get older, we're getting more logic and more information over the materials on the web. Kids will not know how to fix cars or know how to start up a lawn mower. I think that books should not be taken off the shelf because as the days go by, kids' reality is getting taken away more and more! I think that it is a big deal what kids learn about everyday life because that is our future. If they have no idea what is going on, it scares me because there are going to be a lot more battles for our kids to fight. We just have to teach them all that we can and hope that they become the best people they can be in life. By allowing them access to a wide range of books, we can help them develop the critical thinking skills needed to navigate the real world. Thank You for Your Time! Deven.
896	3873	2	3	Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as there have been the various mediums of art, such as paintings, sculptures, and literary works. In many cases, the censorship involves the removal of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then, in other more serious issues, the censor has deemed certain content not suitable for a specific audience, or even for an entire country. What gives it that a select few have the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lewd in nature? Censorship has and still is a very useful tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely known cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries, all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the well - being of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occurred in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relinquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing is still occurring in @LOCATION5 today, with a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1, the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time, it was reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship is @LOCATION2; their @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so - called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'. In our home country of the @LOCATION1, we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries, they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatant restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so, why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard - fought for and earned by our forefathers. The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder 'Is it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intelligent art, others of a more deviant nature create some more inappropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography is the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries' bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It is a reasonable question, one that should be taken into consideration, but in answer to it, I believe that it is and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that brings the child with them. It is simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want is a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what is and what is not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That is sadly an inevitability that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.
897	3874	2	3	Almost everyone in this world reads. Many people have to read almost every day, people may not realize it but they do. For instance, they read traffic signs, product labels, and text messages. Reading is just a part of life. If you don't know how to read, you are most likely to not be successful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just knew the basic words, people would probably be fine, but people definitely need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf. Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive, they should simply not read it. Just because it offends them, other people may find it interesting. For example, a historical book that contains controversial events might offend some, but others could be fascinated by it. If people just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. People can be offended in the easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way. The same thing with movies, movies can offend people just the same as books. I think movies would offend more than a book would, as the visual and auditory elements can be more impactful. In conclusion, books, movies, or anything of that matter should not be taken off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this world way too easy. One person may love a book and another person hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be taken off the shelfs.
898	3875	2	3	Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today. Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated. They claim that such materials can spread harmful ideas and corrupt the minds of the public. Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression. They think that people should be able to express and access diverse thoughts. The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children. Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids? Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution. Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word. In fact, there is nothing inherently wrong with the concept of censorship. It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise. For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1. While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored. People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings; it is not the government's place to decide for them. While oppressive dictatorship and mass - murder are crimes, reading about them is not. There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands. If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themselves by creating similar material. However, the issue changes completely when one considers children. If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business. However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things. Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them. In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development. When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned. If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain. However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations. Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters. Then, it becomes the parents' responsibility to ensure that their child stays in that section. When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there. This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults. Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library. After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material. In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully. When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly. However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression. Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves.
899	3876	2	3	Books can make a very deep impression on whoever reads them, and sometimes these impressions are not appropriate for the reader. Books that are found inappropriate for children or even teenagers should be reconsidered to be removed off shelves that are exposed to children or teenagers. For example, books with excessive violence or sexual content may have a negative impact on young minds. I think that children should not learn inappropriate material if they are not ready to learn about it, in other words, if they are not age - appropriate. Books are just one thing; there are also movies, music, magazines, and etc. All of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers. Inappropriate media or information should not be exposed to people that are not ready, or mature enough to watch movies, or read books that could harm or give them wrong impressions. Children that have read books or watched inappropriate media can sometimes change how they are like. I think that many children that watch movies, especially those that should not be exposed to them. Some of the movies that I have seen have been very inappropriate, such as horror movies with graphic scenes, and I could not imagine young children watching these movies. This is because I do not think children know as much as we do, so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way. I think that books or media that is inappropriate can change children's childhoods in a negative way. Children and teenagers should also be mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, movies, and magazines. If all the age groups would be exposed to all of the higher - rated movies, books, and magazines, I don't think that would be very responsible on the libraries' part, or whoever was exposing it. I think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere. Parents would also not appreciate if their children were reading, or seeing something that they think their child should not be exposed to. I think that children are simply not mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, magazines, and movies. It would cause a lot of problems for many people. Many of the children would be doing stupid things that they have seen in a movie or read in a book that they thought was cool, or that they should try it. We are already having a problem with pre - teens or teenagers. This is because many of them are exposed to things at an early age they should not see, that affect their actions. There are many actions I have seen or heard of that relate to a book, or movie that probably would not have happened if the person was not exposed to it. Children simply are not ready, or mature enough to be exposed to everything that books, movies, or magazines have to offer. It can change the way that children think, or what they think would be cool to physically do. I think that it is bad enough that a lot of teenagers have been exposed to a lot of these things already. This should be a wake - up call for those who have children. Books should not be exposed to every age group, because it would hurt society and whoever is not ready to learn or witness what they will.
900	3877	2	3	Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies. These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials. But what about the adults? Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship is not fair to the adults. Books now are being rewritten so they won't have offensive language in them. To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this. Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it. This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the African - Americans, and if that was altered, the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism. For instance, the raw language in the book reflects the harsh reality of that time. If libraries have books that are censored, they
901	3878	2	3	There are a great number of excellent books at a public library. You can obtain all sorts of different types of books there. You can get a book on anything you truly need, whether it's specific facts you want to know or anything you wish to learn how to do. I'm certain that there is a book available that can assist you. Just because a book presents an opinion doesn't mean it should be removed from the shelves. Everyone perceives things differently.   If you read, it can benefit you in numerous ways. You can learn a great deal just from reading a book. Personally, I dislike reading, so I don't learn much from it. I'm more of a hands - on person. Words just go in one ear and out the other. It's really difficult for me to understand when I'm trying to read and listen or write and listen as I lose my train of thought too easily. In conclusion, while reading may not be for everyone, we should still respect the diversity of books in the library and not hastily remove those with different opinions.
902	3879	2	3	Now take a moment and vividly go back to high school. Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom, feeling the mystery and suspense in every step? What about fighting bravely for @PERSON2's freedom alongside @PERSON1, sharing their passion and determination? Perhaps getting people into amusing trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1, laughing at the chaotic situations? No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you surely recall the wonderful feeling that washed over you when reading it. It gently enveloped you into its world, and you felt every single sensation it offered, as if you were a part of the story. What is this though? The author is a @CAPS2. The author uses occasional bad words. The author is a woman. These are not acceptable excuses to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in public libraries is wrong.   The @CAPS3 was an extremely dark time. Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were brutally killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked? This was clearly wrong. Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others?   Let us now look closely at what a book, movie, magazine, or song is considered offensive and thus to be censored for. A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis in the compilation. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. It would be truly pathetic.   So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions? One thing is certain, I will not. I will firmly stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. One day my plea will be heard. Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it.
903	3880	2	3	Dear Newspaper:   @CAPS1, there should indeed be censorship in libraries, but people should be of a certain age just to check the book out. Some people go to the libraries precisely because of the existing censorship.   These days, censorship basically serves as a way to get children or students interested in picking up a book. Plus, if the parents allow their child to read censored books because they think it does no harm to the child, which it doesn't. Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so that not just anyone will be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2, just to solve the age - related problem. However you do it, the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people.   I know you think censorship should be removed from every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that, then the libraries will go out of business for good. That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on their shelves. I'm finished but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out of the libraries? In conclusion, we need to carefully consider the implications of removing censorship from libraries as it could have a detrimental impact on their survival.
904	3881	2	3	I think censorship is incredibly stupid when it comes to applying it to adult shows. I can understand why they put it on kids' shows. Kids are in a stage of development where they need protection from inappropriate content. But like really? You guys will put that stuff on good movies or songs? What has ever happened to freedom of speech? Adults should have the right to choose what they watch and listen to. Censoring adult - oriented content restricts our ability to express ourselves and experience different forms of art. In conclusion, while censorship has its place for protecting the young, it should not be over - applied to adult shows, movies, and songs as it goes against the principle of freedom of speech.
905	3882	2	3	"There should not be a certain kind of unjust removal of books in the library. Books should not be taken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. If you don't like a book, don't get it. Other people might like it; it's just for entertainment. When you're in the library looking for a book, if there is one that doesn't seem right, just look past it. It won't even be a bother. There are a large number of books in the library. Just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a so - called ""bad"" book, just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books.   If other people would like the book, then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. It may be offensive to some people, but there will be some other people in the world who like that same book. Some people go to the library just to see those kinds of books. Certain people like certain types of books. Maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be an interesting book; all there is to do is give it a try. If anything, the reader might even like the book and check it out.   The books are there for entertainment. That's why they have so many different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult doesn't like a kid's book because it's giving the kid the wrong idea, then don't get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though.   Books should be left out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf based on one person's opinion. All they have to do is not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers' entertainment. In conclusion, the library should maintain a diverse collection of books to cater to different tastes and not let individual objections lead to unnecessary censorship."
906	3883	2	3	My say would be no. Because all that was history. Say you had something like a KKK - related thing or anything similar. Suppose you had a waiting period but needed the information for that situation. You would need information, and that information would have notes, dates, and other details. This shows that past events, though they might seem unimportant now, can still have elements that require proper documentation and understanding.
907	3884	2	3	I do believe in censorship, but I do believe that it is not that big of a deal. It should be the parents' job to block materials that they think are bad for their kids. If the content is too inappropriate, then it is the parents' right to make sure that their kid does not see it. My point of view on stopping materials like books, music, movies, and magazines is that some things are not meant to be shown, read, or heard by someone of a younger age unless they get the okay from their parents. The views of censorship in my mind are that if someone sees something they don't like, they want to get rid of it. And if it is something seriously wrong, then yes, it should be censored. But if it could be avoided and is a minor issue, like a single word in a book, then I say that people should be a little more understanding of it and try to think past it or find another way to deal with it. If you don't like something, then maybe you should not read it or listen to it, and if it is so bad, don't let your kids get involved in it. I have never found a book and read it and found it offensive or disturbing. I have found books that I don't like or are not good, but never have I seen something so bad that I never want anyone to read it. If people are going to censor something, I think it should be for a good reason, not because they don't like the person or they think their idea is wrong, but for something that is bad about an entire race or is too graphic for a young age. My point in censoring something, in my mind, is the right way to look at it. We see it all the time in the real world; people do something because they don't like someone, and they try some extreme things to get rid of some bad material. But in any case, there is a lot in this world that people should know about. And when I do have kids, I will decide whether to block something if I want to, and that is how it should be. In conclusion, censorship should be a well - thought - out decision, mainly left to parental judgment.
908	3885	2	3	If I was given the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries, I would think neither taking the books off the shelf, nor leaving them on are quite correct. I would definitely recommend a voting to take place, in order to figure out what to do with the books. I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended. So I would take at least ten different people with different religions, backgrounds, and so on, and I would have them all vote on what they thought they should do with the offensive books. People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all. That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone. Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.' There are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other. This is the main reason voting is tough, because there's a wide variety of people on earth today. You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because there is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before. Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area. Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, it should be labeled in case someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book. Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now. Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well. Voting is always important and people should notice that. I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in the world today. In conclusion, voting offers a fair way to handle the issue of offensive books in libraries, respecting the diverse views of the community.
909	3886	2	3	Whenever has a few bad things being said ever affected how or what people read these days? That's what is popular in this present lifetime. No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on whether certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions. In my opinion, no one's work should be taken off of a shelf due to anything, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got taken off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionally. Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are too embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an online article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast. Finally, as everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or album and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G - rated movies should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated PG - 13 and up should be behind the counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience. Now that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libraries, what are your thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay? You have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topic. If you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you approach it? In conclusion, censorship decisions should balance respect for creators and public sensibilities.
910	3887	2	3	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are used for people's enjoyment. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries' reading materials. Books give people another way to learn new things, instead of just in a class. If the reading materials are already in the classroom, they should not be removed. If someone is walking into a library, they have to be responsible. Adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and what's not acceptable. No one has the right to take a book off of the shelf because they think it's offensive. There are millions of books in the world that people find offensive. There's not one perfect book in this world that doesn't bother somebody. Every single book that is made today has a right to be read. There are people out in the world looking for a certain book, magazine, movie, and even music. That material is helping find the answer to a problem, giving the right decision, and helping someone walk in the right path. The Bible is a book of understanding and knowledge. There are a good number of people who think we shouldn't read it, or even pick it up. Like the Bible says, free will. It's our free will to pick up books we want to read. Books give people another way to learn new things. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries' reading materials. Books, music, movies, and magazines are used for people's enjoyment. In conclusion, we should respect the free - will of readers and the value that various materials can bring, rather than arbitrarily removing them from libraries.
911	3888	2	3	Should offensive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as an American citizen. If you think books should be censored, then think about this. Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the Bible because those words are considered offensive? I do not think so. Those words give power to the book. Offensive books are an insight into history and culture. Taking away these books will limit education. Books should not be censored.  A very resentful and much - talked - about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.' The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man. In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently. A lot of people were offended by the use of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with'slave.' Some people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story. I agree with the latter statement. The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers. I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotation, but that is the purpose of using the word. The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then. When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful.  Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of censorship. On television, nudity and language are censored when deemed inappropriate. It should be up to the parent to decide which books their child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch. If the parent sees the book as offensive or thinks that their child should not read it, then they should be the ones who make sure their child does not read it. The books should not be taken off the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents. In conclusion, books should not be censored. If a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it.
912	3889	2	3	Imagine @CAPS1, you are in the library looking for a book to read, when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. What do you do? A library should not have inappropriate items on the shelves. Censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family. Libraries should be censored so that everyone can enjoy themselves.  The first reason I think that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. Children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different. An example I have of @CAPS1 is my baby sister. She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' This shows that children want to see different things and if they were to go to the library and see the same items then there is not anything to worry about. But the first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new.  The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place. Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the movie you thought it was. What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over? Would that not embarrass you? Well, something like that happened to my cousin but she got a @LOCATION1. She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened. All of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored.  The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive. Would you be offended by seeing something like that? I know that I would. I would not want anyone to be offended like that. When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother. We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me. I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked. I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other people's feelings into account before they offend.  While some people think that inappropriate material is fine to have in a library, I believe that they should find other places for it. Think of your family and how much you love them. Think of what not having a censor on the libraries can cause. Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help? Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries. In conclusion, libraries should be censored to protect the well - being and comfort of all patrons, especially children.
913	3890	2	3	Why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves? That is ludicrous. There are so many alternatives other than to just take those certain books off the shelves completely.  We all have seen or heard of books that are inappropriate to certain audiences. It is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kinds of materials such as: books, magazines, poems, movies, songs. It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent it.  One way libraries throughout the nation can prevent this is by making a completely different library section or have the explicit materials be located in the total opposite side of the library from the children's materials. I know that libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and children's materials, but there should be more strict rules of kids being in the adult section.  Another idea is to have parental permission on the child's own library card telling the librarian, when the child checks out a book, where in the library they can get a book. For example, maybe the child's parents only will allow him/her to get materials from the children's section in the library; therefore, if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless his/her parents are there telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it.  I know when I was a child and I couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset, but now that I look back I realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing. They wanted me to be a child as long as possible. They knew if I was reading or listening to inappropriate materials then I was growing up way too fast. I know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me.  To conclude, let's keep those filthy books and magazines away from the younger kids. I don't want to see it banned from the libraries or taken out of libraries; I just want to see parents stepping up to be parents and not letting their young children be exposed to that kind of thing. It isn't the libraries' faults if people's children are being exposed to this explicit material; it's the parent's fault for letting it happen. By implementing these simple measures, we can ensure that libraries remain a safe and educational place for all ages.
914	3891	2	3	Should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves? Should movies you loved and used to watch when you were a kid be gone in an instant?  Magazines are often offensive. They always have been. They get the truth out of celebrities and people and they twist their words into something totally different from what they said. There are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people, replay a bad part of somebody's life, or say things about people. Music is just words and sound. They make songs about people that have done stuff in the past, that people would find offensive. I have seen a music video about @PERSON1 and making fun of her being in jail, but do I think that should be taken off the computer? No, it's entertaining.  This world needs something to keep us entertained. Imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters, no paparazzi. We wouldn't know anything going on around the world. And seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive, I can understand where they are coming from. Getting talked about all the time, especially about mistakes you have made in your lives, but that's how the world functions. That's always going to be a part of everyone's lives - talk.  So, as I have been saying, getting rid of movies, music, magazines, books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion. What would entertain us if they were gone? We should accept that a certain level of offensiveness is a part of our entertainment and information - sharing culture, and instead focus on personal choices of what to consume.
915	3892	2	3	Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. This means the freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions. This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that come with freedom of speech.  In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech. What they @MONTH1 not like could very well be what others do like.  So, why should other people's form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one person's disapproval? It shouldn't. Everyone expresses themselves in their own way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country. Just because they think it is right doesn't always mean it is right. Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff, but why keep them from the real world? Let people out to see what this world is like and its various types of art. In conclusion, we should uphold the principle of freedom of speech in libraries and other cultural institutions, allowing people to make their own choices about the materials they consume.
916	3893	2	3	"You are not eligible to check out this book,"" says the librarian. ""You are just too young for this book."" To me, censorship laws in libraries are not needed. The common people should have the liberty to check out whatever they please. The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. Everyone takes things in differently; being said, some are more mature than others. If they want to play that game, or read that book, they should be allowed. The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. Therefore, they are held accountable for their actions. Isn't that how legal laws are carried out? If any sort of content is found offensive, it still shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Something might seem offensive to one person, but someone else might find that interesting. For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete, they might say things that offend his or her fans. The people who are not fans of him or her might find it amusing. So, should they remove the post because some people don't like it? Someone might like that book, music, movie, or magazine. Don't inconvenience them because of a few people. Interests might vary, but a teen might like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws won't let the teen read the book they like because of his or her age, and to me, that is unfair. It is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. Censorship laws should be wiped out completely. If you might find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form, just don't read it. Nobody is forcing you to read that specific book; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books. There is a book out there that you will enjoy. In conclusion, certain material shouldn't be removed from shelves if found offensive. Some other people might like that same material. There shouldn't be censorship laws in libraries at all. That is just unfair and unjust to some people. It's a new time and age, and things are different. People of any age should be able to check out any book they please."
917	3894	2	3	The things we find in libraries shouldn't be offensive to anybody. It's the choice you make whether you want to read it or not. Nobody is making you look at those things if you don't want to. Don't look at it if you think it's offensive. The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves. Some people like looking or reading things like that. People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like. If that was to happen, then there wouldn't be any libraries around because anything you get from the library, I bet you can find something offensive about it. People find stuff like that entertaining when they watch or read stuff like that. That hurts the people that make the books and movies that are considered offensive because they feel like that's what people want to see. True enough, that's what people want to see as long as it's not affecting them in any kind of way. What we see on a daily basis on TV are offensive things. So, if we can sit there and watch it on TV, then we shouldn't have any problem reading or watching a book about it. I see stuff that's offensive on TV almost every day, but it doesn't bother me. So, reading a book or anything else like that, I wouldn't care because I'm used to seeing it on TV. Nobody can make you read or stop reading things like that; only you can. You don't have to look at it if you think it's offensive. It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because that's what we hear and see every day. No matter what, some people find that entertaining. In the end, it's all about personal choice and not restricting the availability of materials just because a few might find them offensive.
918	3895	2	3	"What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of. Censorship can be a good thing; it could also be a bad thing. Does censorship really help in our society? Actually, think about it. There is still murder, rape, and whatever else with censorship. How I would argue with this is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings. Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows. In some movies, you get to choose what you want to watch: the unrated version or the censored version. Well, most people want to watch the unrated version because it's more than likely more funny and shows more. Other people might choose the censored version because of the fact that they have children and don't want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version. I would preferably pick the unrated version because I like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version. Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out a lot of words because, of course, you are not allowed to say them on television. Parents don't want their six - year - old going around and saying all those nasty words. That's why most of the time you hardly ever see those kinds of shows on in the afternoons; they are usually on at night or later. Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows. I can't say that I don't watch shows that have some language in them, nor can I say that I don't watch shows that are all bloody and gory. I do watch them, but I would never watch them around my younger sister! She is eleven years old. I don't want my little sister going to school and saying a bad word and having a teacher hear her. Then she would say, ""Well, [PERSON1] was the one who watched the movie."" I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either. Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money somehow. Right? Last but not least, my readings about, let's say, books and/or music lyrics. So many books have been banned across the [LOCATION1] because people were offended by them or just didn't want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it. Some songs can't be played on the radio because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and throughout the song. That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song so they can be played and so they will get popular. I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also at my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were. When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and don't let it bother me. Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he or she uses the words they use. Censorship can be good or bad; it really depends on how you look at things. Honestly, I have no objections to censorship at other times I do. My experiences, observations, and/or reading have made me think about how censorship could be bad or good. In the end, we need to find a balance that respects both individual freedoms and the well - being of society."
919	3896	2	3	I believe that if you find a book offensive, then you should not read that book. What some people find as offensive, some other people might find it not offensive. I do not think that people should be able to take books off of the shelves. For example, if there is a person of the Jewish religion, they might find a book about Hitler offensive. In that sense, if they take the book off of the shelf, then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books, our history of the world will be soon forgotten. Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In reality, it was a hard time for the Africans. I do not think that they should take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation? If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries, what do we do about the Bible? Some people do not believe that there is a God or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So, how would that work out in the long run? It would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well. In reading books as a kid, I have found that some things are bad and I do not like them, but I don't believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books. How do you take away from the people that like to read different novels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future. We should not let personal sensitivities limit the access to knowledge and different perspectives in libraries.
920	3897	2	3	Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we? Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have made their way into our not - so - perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not. It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and shaped into who they will permanently be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics. For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending a long time with her, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of [CAPS1] cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest; it was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine? On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessible to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand as well. The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even [CAPS2]'s have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book. In a world full of diverse content, finding a proper balance in censorship is crucial for the well - being of library users.
921	3898	2	3	Older authors often love to write gruesome stories about their pasts, be it in fiction or non - fiction works. Sometimes, these books can end up in the wrong hands, perhaps those of impressionable young readers, and then end up in the trash or burned. Other times, parents get angry at what their children are doing and saying. They usually blame television or other kids at school, but parents don't always look at the big picture. Any child at any time can simply walk into their school or public library and pick up an inappropriate magazine, book, or movie. Parents don't usually catch on until it's too late. There are all kinds of books out there, and no two books are the same. Nobody can tell a book is going to be inappropriate just by looking at the front cover. Even though books are meant to be read, it doesn't mean they should be read by all age groups. No book at any point in time should be completely removed from a library; that's just not right. No matter how graphic, perverted, or inappropriate a book can get, it should never be thrown away. Those certain books are written for people with those kinds of interests. Even books about drugs should be allowed to be read. Some children or adults could be interested in what drugs really do to your body and mind, and they'd rather read a book about it rather than trying it themselves. Books about murder should also be allowed to be read, but not by children under twelve. If people in libraries would just start putting books in organized age - groups, then there probably wouldn't be any problems. The author should never be blamed for something they wrote. It's their own personal thoughts and feelings, and most of all, it's their story. It's how they wanted it to be written, and nobody should get mad over that. The same rule should apply for magazines, music, and movies. Those people wrote the books, movies, magazines, and music, so it should be expressed the way they wanted it to be. Even if the authors themselves thought their own writing was too bad for a child to read or hear, they would make it clear by putting something like, 'not for children under the age of twelve' or whatever age they recommend. If adults are really getting mad about this, then they need to look back at the kinds of things they were doing, saying, or reading when they were young, and maybe it would change their outlook a little on movies, magazines, music, and books.
922	3899	2	3	Walking into the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you might run into some of those truly disgusting books that are offensive to some people. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. Are you? There are some books, magazines, movies, and so on that we all come across which have very bad language, racism, bad religious talk, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kinds of books; it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism, and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would deeply hurt their feelings, and they would not want to finish that book. There are others who are very religious, and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion, they will be very offended. There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a large, visible warning sign up and separating those books, magazines, and such into their own section so that people who do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover, the librarian could put a clear warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that might offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people! In every library, you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inappropriate, and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it. In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!
923	3900	2	3	"I believe that there are certain movies, music, and other forms of media that are bothering parents. I would not want my kid listening to music that has a lot of content that can teach them things, whether it's right or wrong. I would carefully check the kind of music my child listens to to see if they are being taught bad things. I believe that there are some movies that are too violent for anyone to see, but this is a free country, and us regular average people will watch them anyway. There are movies made for adults, but how many adults let their kids watch them too? No matter what is produced, there will be people who don't like what they see or they know somebody who didn't like what they saw. Sometimes there are people that don't like what they hear, or knows somebody who didn't like what they heard in music or on the television. There are times my mom hears something on TV or music and says, ""Turn that off."" My friends all listen to this music that I don't think amounts to anything but the glorification of inmates and other wrong - doings such as gangs, fights, shootings, and jury trials. There are things on the market that target a certain group who might like action movies. Well, there are kids out there learning those things they saw, and they are trying to do what they saw because they think that it will make them look cool. There will always be things that people do not like and will never like. I learned that when I was young, just like most young kids have. I think the biggest things that sell are the drama, action movies, and the stuff that parents will like. There is very little of baby movies and baby music. But what can you do about that? I like most of what I hear and see. I have always thought there was a lot of violence, graphic picture shots, and things about drugs that just should not be on national television to teach the young. This is what I think, and we should be more cautious about the media our children are exposed to."
924	3901	2	3	Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way. Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same. As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiosity, and they prefer to think outside the box. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. Therefore, if a person is mature enough and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with the permission of a guardian, of course. Unfortunately, it is often times a small group of minorities that ruin something for the greater group. Libraries often take into account a child's age as a factor towards what they can and cannot read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read and handle the more adult - rated intellect in a proper manner. If one is legally eligible and they have permission from their guardian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library whatsoever. Who is one to say a ten - year - old is too young to learn about @PERSON1 and his horrible plans for the @CAPS1? A person is never too young or too old to learn something new if the curiosity and the proper level of maturity is present! It is curiosity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day. As well, it is curiosity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology and inventions that it is at today. The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and influential leaders of the future. If these young people are curious and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be. We should encourage their curiosity and provide them with the resources to learn.
925	3902	2	3	In most libraries in the @LOCATION1, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children. These books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing. However, this does not mean that the libraries of @LOCATION2 should get rid of these books, videos, etc. The libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of @LOCATION2 like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational. When you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were too young. Your @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough. They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies. The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them. If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library. They do not want to be reading children's books all the time. Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies. Most of the parents in the @LOCATION1 have used offensive language in front of their child without even realizing it. The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 use them. Another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game. They have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies. It's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content'. Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational materials. For example, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1. These wars actually occurred, and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars. If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened. There is no point in trying to hide the truth. Overall, most kids in the @LOCATION1 have heard offensive language or graphic content. Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it. So why would we try to hide this from them? Keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the accurate portrayal of the country's history.
926	3903	2	3	Do you think @CAPS1 is going to prevent people from getting offended? Taking items such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., which are forms of self - expression and knowledge dissemination, will not stop people from getting offended. People have diverse sensibilities and worldviews, so what one person finds offensive, another may not. The @CAPS2 question's are who decides what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive? In a free and diverse society, it's nearly impossible to have a one - size - fits - all definition of offensive content. Therefore, simply removing items is not a practical solution to the issue of people getting offended.
927	3904	2	3	Many people in the @LOCATION1 enjoy reading. Books, magazines, newspapers, and music are a great way to pass the time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers, as they offer a world of imagination and mystery. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.  Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You would be truly baffled as to why all of your loves have disappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with'sensitive' ears. If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been banned, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip - hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a buffoon? Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed. For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention - getting, eye - opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction. In conclusion, we should preserve the diversity of library content and not let the concept of 'offensive' lead to the loss of these valuable resources.
928	3905	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My choice is no. I have several reasons for that. One is that this is a free country and a person has the right to speak on how they feel or what's on their mind. And that should be acceptable anywhere because everyone has their own opinion about what they like or read. And if you feel that it offends you, maybe you shouldn't be reading it or watching it or whatever the case may be. You can find something else to read that you'll enjoy or that your friends and family may like. My second reason is that you can learn from stuff that may offend you in any kind of way. Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging their pants. Many white people that saw their pants below their waist had something negative to say about the young men. They only judged a book by its cover because they didn't know anything about the person they were talking about, and one of the black males was an honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college. And when many whites started to find out, they began to question the young man about how he dressed and why. He told them this is a free country and I can do whatever I like, and the whites liked that he spoke up for himself. So with my reasons being said, I find it not right to remove certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves if they are found offensive. So I hope you enjoyed reading my essay. If you have any arguments or questions, you can surely contact me. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of content and use it as an opportunity for learning rather than removing it based on offense.
929	3906	2	3	No Censorship Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to may be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it. The first reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many non - fiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture may find what the authors of non - fiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 and books about slaves may be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people may love the book because of the good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive or not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library. Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like may be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves, I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often. A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they may find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that may be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie. Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to? In the end, libraries should remain a place of free access to diverse materials, allowing people to make their own choices.
930	3907	2	3	I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive'. Something that is offensive to me may not be offensive to another. Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate, somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate. The main issues that most people have with books are foul language, sex, and difference in opinion. These three categories are very sensitive issues, and some may not be comfortable discussing these issues. Many books in the library systems today contain foul language. Surprisingly enough, a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section. I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading. In our modern - day world, we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency. Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines. Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions. Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends. Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree. Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way? Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don't agree with what it says? Should there be a censor on what can and can't be put in libraries? I don't think that any books should be taken off of library shelves. If you don't agree with the book, then don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they aren't reading something they shouldn't. In conclusion, we should trust in the ability of individuals to make their own choices about reading materials and not rely on censorship in libraries.
931	3908	2	3	@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No? Katherine Paterson's insightful quote about offensive books rings completely true, and I wholeheartedly (@PERCENT1) agree with her. She astutely points out that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books left for people in the world. It's quite evident that there are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. Just imagine, what would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I firmly believe that offensive materials such as books should not be removed from shelves. Not everybody could find them offensive, and removing them could be depriving people of their favorite subjects. I've personally had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book.  There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days on end. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Regardless of the subject, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived of it because one person found it offensive. Just because one person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too.  I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'. As we were reading the book, I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. However, later with some research, I found out that the book was banned in a lot of schools all over the @LOCATION1. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a valid reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple of awards, and my class also thoroughly enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned.  Just as @PERSON1 stated, if every person was given the right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be any books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the @LOCATION1, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the @LOCATION1, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing their grades to drop. One little law change in @CAPS1 could cause great negative changes in the future.  There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's an unchangeable fact, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, you're depriving other people of books. So, I firmly believe that every library should stay the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults, allowing everyone the freedom to choose what they want to read.
932	3909	2	3	Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it? I know for sure I would not. If everyone had the right to ban books, then we would end up with no books at all, because there's always something that would offend someone. You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future.  If you ban a book, then you are essentially giving up your individuality. If you let someone else decide what is offensive to you, then how can you truly express yourself? Therefore, by allowing someone else to determine what is appropriate for you to read, you are surrendering your freedom. By banning books, you are not being your true self; you are conforming to what other people want. So, you should not ban books because it demolishes your individuality and makes you conform to the desires of others.  There should not be any banning of books. You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press. The freedom of press means that we have the right to write whatever we want. Moreover, we should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. This implies that we as individuals should be able to decide for ourselves what we want to read and what we do not. You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press and the freedom as individuals to read what we desire.  If you ban books, then you will surely ruin the future. There are hundreds of truly phenomenal books out there that would be unjustly banned, and future generations would not be able to enjoy them. There are books that can change your life, teach you how to deal with various things, and if we ban them, then we are destroying the chance to help future people with their problems. People turn to books for knowledge, help, and ideas, and if we take away their books, then how can we claim to be paving the way for the future when we are actually destroying it along the way? Books should not be banned because if they were, we would be ruining the future for others and destroying our own future as well.  In conclusion, books should not be banned because it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. If you ban books, more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing left to read because all of the books would be banned. By banning books, you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our individuality. We must preserve the integrity of our literary world and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to explore the vast realm of knowledge and imagination that books offer.
933	3910	2	3	Do you think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed from a library's shelf? A library should carry every kind of book, movie, magazine, music, etc. The reason that a library should carry everything is quite simple. Say a farmer wants to come in and get a book about cattle, and some city person says that it's of no use and throws it away. Well, then the farmer is out of luck. Or, say the opposite would happen. Another reason is that people have different tastes. Some people like romance, and some like action. So, if a library doesn't carry one type, someone will get mad about it and might stop going. Say if @PERSON2 does not like violence, so they take all violent materials off the shelf, and @PERSON1 doesn't like chick flicks, etc. What would that leave in a library? No one would have anything to read, and they would likely close the library down because there would only be a few books left.  Regarding movies and magazines, I would say that a library should carry anything that was appropriate. And if it was rated @CAPS1, you had to be @NUM1 to rent it, then the person would be an adult and able to make their own decision. There are different cultures out there that only like certain things. So, what are they going to do? Make separate libraries so that each culture will be happy, or just build one big library and let the ones that don't like a particular item just leave the book or whatever there.  Ultimately, it's up to the parent to teach their child not to pick up the bad items if they're not liked by a certain family or culture. If they would get rid of the stuff one person didn't like, it would lead to a loss of customers and make others mad. So, in my eyes, it's better to have one person mad because a library carries a certain type of item than to lose customers and make @NUM2 people or even more mad just to make one person happy. After all, it's as simple as not picking up the item if you don't like it.  In conclusion, libraries should strive to be inclusive and offer a wide range of materials to accommodate the diverse interests and preferences of their patrons. By respecting individual choices and allowing people to make their own decisions about what to read, watch, or listen to, libraries can continue to serve as valuable community resources. Instead of removing items based on the objections of a few, we should focus on promoting a culture of understanding and acceptance, where everyone has the opportunity to explore and engage with different forms of media.
934	3911	2	3	I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a library. I firmly believe that everyone should have a chance of reading any book they want to. Just because a person or a few people don't like it doesn't mean we should remove it. They don't have to read that book. If I don't like a book, I simply don't read it.  Everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into. For example, I'm really into freaky novels. But everyone I hang out with is not into freaky novels. And I might not be into what they are into. Like I dislike a lot of love stories, not all of them, just a few of them. I can say I am particularly fond of abnormal stories. I prefer fiction stories over non - fiction.  My most favorite novel is 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'. Most people would want to remove the stories with bad language or vocabulary off the shelves. But I know a lot of people that are into those kind of stories. I think that would be extremely unfair to do that. Why take away what they like just because it's not what you like? Like I am into all kinds of sex - related books. Some people wouldn't want those books on the shelves either.  Just by removing someone's type of book could make people lose interest in reading. I know it would make me stop reading if I can't read what I want to read. Now, think to yourself, would you risk taking away someone's favorite book, knowing that the result might be them not reading anymore? If you do, there's something seriously wrong with you. How would you feel if that was to happen to you? So, you should always try to look at it from another person's point of view.  You should look at all the positive aspects first. Like how happy does it make that person who reads the books? Not only would it affect the reader, but also the person who wrote the book. You will be doing a great deal of damage to a lot of people. You would be putting someone out of their job. You could mess up someone's family's livelihood. You could take away someone's beliefs.  You can turn what they thought was a good thing into something bad. You can drive a person crazy. You can make what that person stands for seem meaningless. Books could be a way people escape the real world. Reading books could give people more things to talk about. Books can be a way of learning how to deal with things in a better way.  I suggest that people should just leave the books where they are. Books are a way people express how they feel, their lifestyle, and what they've been through. Life is hard, and books can make it easier for some people. By preserving the availability of all types of books, we are respecting the diverse needs and interests of readers and ensuring that the power of literature continues to enrich our lives.
935	3912	2	3	No criteria such as books, @CAPS1's, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The @LOCATION1 is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you have the freedom not to read it.  When people get all worked up over a book or movie they saw, it really irritates me, simply because you don't have to go see that movie or go read that book. Different people find different things offensive, and this can be due to various factors such as race, gender, ethnicity, etc. So, we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive. Some people think it is offensive that professional athletes get paid @MONEY1 for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street. Nevertheless, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is the most watched event in the world when it comes on. Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good. Another example is racial jokes. Some people think they are funny, while others find them very offensive. This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes.  Just as Katherine Paterson wisely said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive. People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right approach to deal with this issue. If you find something offensive, then simply don't pursue it. Almost every single book in the world has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive. If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read. This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not.  So, instead of choosing to eliminate books from the library, just refrain from reading them. Maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might really like to read that book. We should respect the diverse perspectives and preferences of others and allow for the free flow of ideas through literature. By maintaining the availability of a wide range of materials, we uphold the principles of freedom and individuality in our society.
936	3913	2	3	"@CAPS4 I firmly believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say this is because there's a real risk that little children might be eager to read grown - up books. These books could contain all sorts of naked pictures and words that aren't part of a child's vocabulary. Once they're exposed to such content, they may pick up bad habits and start using these words without knowing what they actually mean.   Then, regarding music, it should definitely be edited. Some music has cursing and talks about things that young - minded children shouldn't hear. The music should be appropriate for the age group of the listeners.   Next, movies should be censored. Nowadays, we're allowing children to watch whatever they want. There are movies that don't help control their language, such as those shown by @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I believe that the @CAPS3 show needs to be blocked because they really do and say explicit things on that show, and a lot of children watch it and repeat everything they hear and see.   Finally, magazines... I say no to magazines with offensive content because they have naked girls and men on the covers and pages, showing far too much. They also put things in the magazines to make them look real when they're actually not. The ""etc."" category, like the internet, should only be used when needed for research and homework because children use the internet to watch explicit things and listen to such bad content.   In conclusion, all together, I think there should be a limit to everything we listen to and watch. Children absorb everything they hear and see, and it's our responsibility to protect them from offensive material."
937	3914	2	3	"I don't think they should remove anything that's offensive from the library. Honestly, most of the books that authors publish have something offensive in them. It's not the library's fault. If there are children reading these offensive books, then that's the parents' fault for letting them read them. I've been to the library and listened to music, watched movies, and even read magazines that have some offensive content in them. But if they were to remove all the offensive content from the library, then the library would be half - empty.   I've seen parents discussing with the librarians about banning content that's not appropriate from the library. But why would that even matter if they can just ignore it and keep it away from their children? Offensive content honestly isn't a big deal when it comes to these types of problems. I discussed this with my mom once, and she completely agrees with me. My mom said, ""It wouldn't be a problem as of today if they could have just ignored it."" Also, the music that they have should stay there whether or not it's offensive because people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to. The movies that are made these days all have inappropriate content in them, whether it's a rated @CAPS2 movie or not.   As of all the arguments going on about libraries having offensive content, it should still be kept at the library and not removed. I'm sure a lot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library. If children end up listening to the offensive music or watching offensive movies, then think about it like this: they need to grow up someday. If that's not the case, then parents should keep them away from the content. After all, it's the parents' role to guide their children in what they consume."
938	3915	2	3	Certain material such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. The quote by Katherine Paterson simply states that if everyone had the right to remove a book from a shelf, then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us. The world would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive.   To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all. A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion. There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by everyone.   In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out. That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library. Adult novels, children's books, science fiction novels should all be in different sections of the library. This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes. If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame: the parent. Children always wander off into random places because of curiosity. Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens, such as a toddler or a teenager seeing something they're not supposed to see.   One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons. If those lessons are not taught yet, they will be taught later, in a harder way. The person might have to live the lesson to learn it. That is why some material should not be taken away.   Everyone believes in different things. There is always someone that has a different opinion of things. The world contains many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go. There is always a choice of what to do and what not to do. Someone has to find a way to fix things in a good way where people can find peace with themselves and others. Removing material from libraries can cause many things: approval, disapproval, anger, and happiness. Most of all, it can cause fights, which later on can turn into war. The material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life. If people find that wrong, then it means they do not fully experience life. We should respect the diversity of knowledge and opinions in libraries.
939	3916	2	3	Censorship is not an easy question to answer; it involves a great deal of thought. When thinking about a topic like this, you must look at the bigger picture. You should consider the aftermath, like the thoughts and opinions from everyone else. When it comes to censorship in libraries, I feel that all the books should be left on the shelves.   So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't? If you don't want a child to look at adult books, then you can censor them by watching them and not taking them to places that have such books. This way, other people can read these books. If you truly think about it, then you will realize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen, they can, and will, find a way of getting it. If you are trying to keep things from them, that will only make them want it more.   Books are good for people. They tell them stories that cannot happen, past events they did not live through, and even the thoughts of others. Keeping books away from people is not good for them; they would not be able to learn from the things they read. So, maybe some books are more racy than others, but that does not mean you should hide it from your children.   If you were to start censoring books in libraries, it could cause some problems. Now you will have no books for some people. You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children. This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library, and people will stop going to the library altogether.   So, when you think about banning books, just remember that there are other places to get books. Books are good for people, especially teens, whose minds are developing. In some places, books that are banned in other places are celebrated. When trying to get rid of books, just think about the people you are taking them away from. We should trust in people's ability to make choices and let libraries be a place of free access to knowledge.
940	3917	2	3	You go to a library to read books, listen to music, and read magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines from the shelves. We are supposed to feel safe when reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines. When I was younger, I went to the library all the time. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while, I was excited to go to the library. But all the excitement went away after a few bad experiences. I can't remember the names of the books, but I know I was so upset by how the book was. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book. A library should only have good books, not bad ones.   After that bad experience happened to me, I ignored it, thinking it would go away. But offensive books should be taken off the shelves for good and never to return. I feel very strongly about this subject because I'm a bookworm. I love to read books, and being able to go to a library and find a good, non - offensive book is all that I ask for in a library. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be allowed to be in libraries at all. When kids read books or listen to music, they want to be able to get lost in them. But if there is offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that? There are things that should be left out of libraries, and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.   In closing, I still have full courage in my answer. I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your niece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say? How would you feel? We need to create a safe and positive environment in libraries for everyone, especially the young readers.
941	3918	2	3	When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community. Everyone—teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders—had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read *The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1* in class. In these parents' opinion, the rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter. While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to what was clearly traumatic material. This crusade of theirs posed the questions 'What can and should be censored? And when?'. As the debate continued, I myself began to ponder the subject. Who had the right to tell me what I could read? Or listen to? Or watch? The answer I came to was 'no one'. No one has the right to censor anyone else. This comes with one exception: parents and children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. They must use their best judgment to decide what their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read. This was true in the censorship of *@ORGANIZATION1*, as well. No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel; it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the problem arose. This is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials. Music you love might be offensive to me. Books your teacher assigned might not be appropriate for five - year - olds. Your friends might be offended by your favorite movie or TV show. These feelings are subjective; almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate. We must, as a society, be able to accept this. We learn through what we see, what we hear, and what we read. These experiences teach us what to do, as well as teach us what not to do. Because of this, it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn. Parents have the right to censor what their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn. We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists. If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn. Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect.
942	3919	2	3	Libraries are a source of information. They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts. Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out. Everyone is faced with choices in life. Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts. Everyday we have choices. We also have choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like it might be offensive, then we should just walk past it. Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If it does offend us, then it's our own fault. The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. It's a choice. No one puts a gun to our head and says, 'Read this book or you will die.' It just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to read something we don't want to. It's all up to you and how you feel about the book. Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex - related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own choice to not watch or read those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex - related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see it as perfectly fine to watch or read. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because it offends one person should not happen. If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? It would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because it contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers. I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Some are obviously worse than others; but, when it comes to books and movies, the people know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive. There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display. Libraries should not censor the materials they display.
943	3920	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the Constitution of the United States, to have the freedom to say what they wish within the context of their own individual writing. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who might enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that might be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well. If something is stated in such an important document as the Constitution of the United States, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, then it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the United States, George Washington, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they might be. Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive might not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nations' military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people perceive literature and art. Person A would hate Person B's art, and Person B would hate Person A's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world. Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others might teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used. Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be.
944	3921	2	3	There are many different styles of literature and media in this world. With this variety, it has to please at least one person. If not, why was it made? There comes a point when things just become too much. Some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves. Media is a huge influence in today's society. What would you do without it? Every day, everyone is using media - related things, whether it is turning on the television in the morning and watching the 'Morning News' to opening up a magazine and reading about what famous person is in jail this time. You cannot get away from it. Teens especially are truly addicted for the most part. We have video games, online chats (Facebook and MySpace), and movies. Many things we learn from these are not good for our minds and health. Some video games are good to play but when you become wrapped up in them, playing non - stop, killing people and laughing at this, here you know there is something wrong. Our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence, so we think it is okay to do. Many people see it as, the movie stars do it, so why can't we? This society is killing our minds and many young people who think their life is miserable just go out and commit suicide. Music can get too extensive as well. Yes, you have your oldies, country, and the jazz but when you add in the rap and heavy metal music, there is no understanding. Rap is all about who am I going to sleep with next and how many times I can have sex. Really, is this what our lives should be focused on? I didn't know people like the thought of a playboy. Heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living? People say that this music helps them calm their anger down. Feeling relieved after they have listened to it. You might be calm now but after hearing these words and banging your head around, what is going to happen when you do get extremely mad? Too many lives are affected by this media and literature. Lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined. Someone is always going to say a certain amount is too much, but I think we need to set a goal of how much is too much and try to save ourselves. We are not like a video game that has second lives.
945	3922	2	3	Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are somehow offensive to people if they have inappropriate language or actions or stories in them. Should these materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are too offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting a hold of them? When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, non - fiction, etc. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Libraries don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the children's area. Libraries usually don't carry offensive music. They have audiobooks for books to listen to. That might have offensive language in it. Before renting or buying the audiobook you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they consider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the audiobook. Most of the time you know what you're looking for before you go to the library anyways. If movies are offensive they are marked rated R. PG - 13 movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated R movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated R movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see. Most of the time magazines don't have offensive language in it but they sometimes have inappropriate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if you're letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading. I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the children's section. Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library.
946	3923	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way, such as containing explicit sexual content, extreme violence, or hate speech, should not be allowed to be shown to the public. If these offensive things were not allowed to be shown, I personally think it would help out our country, which is unfortunately full of racist people and documents. Every time you pick up a magazine or watch a television show about a famous actress or musician, you see embarrassing aspects of their lives splashed all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in their lives. If it wasn't for actresses and musicians, we wouldn't have any interesting television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radios. There would be no reason to, as there would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these hard - working individuals anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us. Books in the libraries should not have sexual assaults described in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Especially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them, not vulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school. Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child bringing home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from our local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library; it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. How could my library have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be separate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie. Or at least have a parent's permission. Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Let's keep our children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in our school libraries and local libraries, it is just saying it's okay to let this violence in. We should put a stop to it and promote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf and create a safer and more positive environment for everyone.
947	3924	2	3	Are some materials, such as books, movies, magazines, which may contain inappropriate content like explicit language, sexual themes, or excessive violence, should be removed from the shelves if those things are found offensive? There are some things in books and movies that are offensive, and that other younger adults shouldn't watch or read. Reading a book also reveals a lot about certain topics that are offensive. But at the same time, can you learn from these things such as finding it in a book or seeing it on TV? For example, you might learn about the consequences of bad behavior. So I don't think that certain things that are found offensive should be taken off the shelves, because people should learn from these things. Some people have a hard time understanding what's right and wrong in life, because they're not getting the full effect in life and what it is meant. The problem I think is people might not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it means. Movies on the other hand have a different side of the fence. Movies can affect someone, especially someone who is very young. Those children can look at what's on TV and copy exactly what they are doing. They also might be a role - model which is not always good for some people. Another thing is that music plays a big role in someone's life because there is sad music, loving music and also violent music. Music can define a person. For example, if you are listening to a sad song, you might feel sad or depressed. Or a person listening to hard and violent music might feel upset or angry. Certain music that people listen to can define who they are. Especially when I had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in. I think when people listen to the music he or she likes, it defines who they are, it shows what kind of mood they are in. Secondly, magazines are an advertisement. It shows everything, it tells you stories. Just like in the movies if you see it, you're going to do it. But magazines are different, they show like the styles, and life stories of others. When you see things you might want to do things just as what the magazine shows. Usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so it's not as big of an effect as the others such as the music and movies. They more likely describe things. Books on the other hand are similar. You can learn what's in a book just by reading it. So if a person might read something about violence he or she might think it is right to do so. Even if that particular book is telling you what's right about the topic. So no, I don't think that some books that are found offensive should be removed because only that person or individual can learn what being offensive is. So keeping these types of books might help other people who are readers, as they can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
948	3925	2	3	What is @LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music? The idea of @LOCATION1 in those categories is freedom. Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person. It is one of the amendments in the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech. Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public. It is their right as an @CAPS3 to buy what they want. It takes away @CAPS2 from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see. Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better? I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway. That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive. We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. @PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it. Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking. But he did it, and proved himself right. Galilaue @CAPS5 thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the @LOCATION2. He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory. The people of where he did his work got enraged and threw him into exile and imprisoned him. After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him. Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the @LOCATION2. That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world. It makes people think in different ways. It helps people think of new ideas. Freedom is the key to any way of living, and we should always strive to protect it.
949	3926	2	3	There are a lot of things that you can find in the libraries that you can find to be inappropriate to some but not all people. For instance, there could be books with explicit sexual content or magazines with violent imagery. If there was something that I was offended by then I would ask them to pull it off the shelf. If you have somewhat of a project to do then go to the library to meet some friends and work on it there. The library provides a quiet and resource - rich environment. If you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it. The library staff is trained to assist patrons in locating the materials they need. The library is here to help those that don't have a computer at home; they can go to the library and do their work there. If they would have a lot of their books on a disc or DVDs, movies, tape players, a lot more people would want to read more. This would offer different ways of consuming information. If all libraries had all the same books then they would have more people in and out getting the book they want to read. If there were little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them, with colorful and engaging books. All the libraries should get rid of the inappropriate books that some of the people find offensive right off the shelf so that they don't have people complaining about the material on the shelf. There are probably about @NUM1 to @NUM2 libraries in the @LOCATION1. I know for a fact that there is something inappropriate on the shelf in all their libraries. There are tons and tons of books in all of the libraries so there's a good chance there is something out there that someone will find they don't like and ask for it to be taken off the shelf. If they would get a lot of people saying they are offended by it then they would have to take it off. There is also a lot of magazines out there that some should not be seen by little kids. If they get a magazine that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offended by that. All magazines should have somewhat of a rating on them. You would have to be older than @NUM3 years of age to get a pg - @NUM3 mag. Some of the magazines should be for little kids that go there all the time and adults. They should have them divided into sections for little kids and adults. They need to respect all the people in the library at that time. I think that there is some of that here in our hometown but not @PERCENT1 positive there is. We all have the right to ask them to take it off the shelf and if they don't then they will get into trouble. By ensuring a proper selection of materials, libraries can create a more suitable environment for all patrons.
950	3927	2	3	Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of @LOCATION1. This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others. Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers. For example, a book with a non - traditional view on a historical event might be removed. It's not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but it's not about what they like. It's about the people in general that have a certain interest towards that subject. Some people have even removed the @CAPS2 from local library systems. Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. The belief in a religion or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about; sex, drugs or alcohol is removed for just that. If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left @CAPS3 be children's books. Some people @CAPS3 find ways to get those censored as well. We @CAPS3 become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature, as we would lose a vast source of knowledge and different perspectives. There's even an account of a person being fired from their job for reading a magazine on their break at work! What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf? Then another and another, we @CAPS3 have no books in our libraries or stores. This censorship is a major problem, yet very few people really care about this subject. Most think it should be done to most items, some think we don't need to censor anything, as we are a free country. So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, '@CAPS3 I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again?' Then everyone will know the answer, and we should strive to maintain a balance between protecting the public and respecting the freedom of expression.
951	3928	2	3	Some books on the library shelves contain inappropriate content, whether it's the subject matter, the curse words within, or simply being unsuitable for certain age - groups. The question arises: should the books at libraries be censored, or should we leave it to the readers to decide? I firmly believe that neither books nor magazines should be censored. If someone wishes to read a book with curse words or similar content, they should be allowed to. Some parents may not permit their kids to read such books, while others don't really care. I think that if kids read such content, they might initially mimic the language, but they will eventually learn that those words are not nice to use.  What about movies from libraries? I don't think they should be censored either. Parents will prevent their children from getting or watching movies they deem inappropriate. Kids are aware of what they can and can't watch. If they pick up an inappropriate movie, parents can take it away and explain why they can't watch it.  Should all books, magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censored? No. In a school library, all materials must be school - approved. If a book, movie, magazine, or music is not appropriate, the school can't lend it out. Public libraries, on the other hand, have mostly adults. Kids should know their limits regarding what they can read, watch, or listen to. Some parents may advocate for censorship, but doing so would limit the reading options for everyone, including parents and adults. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is unnecessary as readers and parents can make appropriate choices on their own.
952	3929	2	3	What do you think about books? Do you consider how appropriate they are to be important? Well, I'm going to share my opinion on which books should and shouldn't be in libraries. I believe that people have a wide range of views on books. One can't simply claim that a particular book shouldn't be in a library. If a book is inappropriate for grade - school students, it could be placed in a high - school or public library. I understand that some parents may not want their kids reading such books, but kids are going to encounter worse things in life than what a book might contain.  I also understand where parents are coming from when they object to their children reading certain books. However, I believe that if a child wants to read a particular book, they will find a way to do so. Parents shouldn't be overly strict about what their kids read. They want to protect their children, but exposure to such content is inevitable, so kids might as well get used to it. Moreover, a grade - school library shouldn't have books considered inappropriate for students, or at least require a parent's signature indicating their approval.  In conclusion, if parents have concerns about library books, they should discuss the issue with the school. They can talk to the librarian and express their wishes regarding their child's access to certain books. By taking this simple step, all related problems can be resolved.
953	3930	2	3	To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. Undoubtedly, there are numerous different views on this topic. Everyone will present valid points for either using or not using censorship in libraries. However, I firmly believe that there are far more compelling reasons against implementing censorship in libraries. First of all, how truly offensive can library material be? I don't think it's very offensive at all. There are movies and materials specifically designed for a mature and older age group. This is perfectly acceptable; if a person is of the appropriate age, they should have the freedom to choose advanced material. A mature individual won't want to read elementary - level books throughout their life. Eventually, they need to be introduced to real - life content. Sheltering them for their entire lives won't benefit them or society.  If the person is a child, there should generally be no reason for them to select older - level material. There may be times when a child does choose such material, but this isn't a problem. Parents can simply explain to the child that they are not old enough yet. It's an easy solution. As I mentioned earlier, there's no need for everyone to read the same thing.  Variety is what makes libraries attractive to customers. Who would want to visit a library with all identical books? I certainly wouldn't. Libraries have dedicated children's sections. Removing slightly offensive material would reduce the number of customers and discourage writers from creating new works, thus affecting their income and motivation. In our country, we have the freedom of choice, and I feel that implementing censorship in libraries would go against our values.  No one is perfect, and we all make mistakes. But we can learn and improve from them. If someone chooses an inappropriate book, they'll likely learn from the experience. When we go to the library, we have the freedom to choose, and most of the time, we make the right decisions.  Libraries are centers of learning and information. This wouldn't hold true if certain information were removed. I've had many great experiences in libraries and have never been harmed or offended. Libraries are meant to assist us in learning, not hinder it. I'm sure I'm not the only one who is satisfied with the current state of libraries and sees no need for change. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to the free flow of knowledge and the rights of readers.
954	3931	2	3	My opinion on censorship in libraries is that libraries are excellent places to access information from various types of books, including biographies, fiction, non - fiction, science fiction, and other genres. I firmly believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be removed from the shelves. People love music and want to learn about the artists and the lyrics of the songs.  Books are equally important. People enjoy reading and want to know the content and gain information from books. They serve as a source of entertainment beyond television and are also used for study purposes, especially when preparing for a test on a particular book. However, books that are found offensive should be removed. Some people get very upset if a book speaks negatively about them, unless they are very immature and can't handle even non - personal offensive content.  Movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves either, as people love watching them for entertainment. If a movie is extremely offensive to the audience, it might be best to remove it. But many movies, even those with foul language, are still enjoyed by people. Sometimes, people hear something from a movie and spread it around, leading to the use of foul language. However, people should learn to avoid using such language when it's not appropriate.  Magazines are also valuable. People, especially sports fans like me, love reading sports - related magazines. Magazines have various uses, such as comics, providing housework tips, and offering beauty advice for ladies. However, inappropriate magazines for children should be removed. Overall, magazines are considered important to society. In conclusion, while offensive materials should be removed, most library materials should remain accessible to meet the diverse needs and interests of the public.
955	3932	2	3	Censorship in libraries is an almost primitive, if not childish, way of excluding what one might consider offensive from everyone else, isn't it? Think about it. A kid who refuses to let another kid play with him at recess just because of a minor incident in math class the previous day seems rather childish, and there are many more reasonable solutions that come to mind with just a bit of thought. This situation is similar to censorship in libraries.  A book is meant to be read, which is an obvious fact. But why do we read books? To gain information, learn something new, or expand our existing knowledge. For example, if you want to know how to cook an exquisite meal or graph linear equations, you can find relevant books. Is it fair for an astronomy enthusiast who has no interest in cooking to remove a book on cooking a turkey from the library? Of course, cooking a turkey is unlikely to be offensive to library - goers, but consider this: the fact that a book has been written means it's not offensive to at least one person, the author.  There will always be things that people don't agree with. Just when you think you've found something that everyone likes, someone will come along and disrupt the harmony. Not everyone likes rap music, but it still plays on the radio. Listening to it is a matter of free choice, just like reading a book, regardless of its content. Just because someone accidentally encounters offensive material and expresses their dissatisfaction to the library staff doesn't mean the material should be discarded.  Let's further compare radios and libraries. Radios have specific channels for different types of music. There's a country - music channel for those who love country music. In libraries, while there is the Dewey Decimal System, categorization could be more detailed. Suppose books were further distinguished by their location within the library. Specific areas could be designated for different genres. That way, if someone finds books about a particular topic, like concentration camps, distasteful, they can avoid the relevant aisle in the history section. Problem solved. It's hard to be offended by something you can't even see.  You see, outright removal isn't the best way to satisfy dissatisfied people. Compromise is the key. After thinking about this situation for more than a moment, I'm sure you can come up with more reasonable solutions than the ludicrous idea of censorship. In the end, the goal is for people to enjoy books without being offended by the ones they don't like.
956	3933	2	3	Having libraries is a good thing because it teaches children to learn how to read and gain insights from the book or magazine that they are reading or simply looking through. This exposure helps them develop their language skills and imagination. It also raises the question of how libraries can assist children and family members who have little knowledge of reading and writing. Some libraries have well - organized shelves, while surprisingly, some do not, which seems rather odd. Libraries house books and magazines suitable for children, adults, and even grandparents. There's also the issue of determining the proper placement of books on bookshelves or carts. It requires a great deal of respect for the library's resources and significant physical effort to arrange the items appropriately. Librarians can offer more than just books; they may have CDs, computers, and a table with coloring pages for children. However, I think inappropriate items should be removed because I wouldn't want my children going into the library and encountering a bunch of things they don't understand. Such items have no place in a library in the first place. The librarians should persuade the donors to take back these inappropriate items. Instead, libraries should stock items that are suitable for a quiet reading environment, like books or provide computers for doing homework. It's ridiculous that librarians sometimes have inappropriate things that children see regularly, as this can teach them bad behavior. They need to figure out how to ensure that inappropriate items are not in the library where children can access them. A child might take a book home without knowing its content, which could be inappropriate. In conclusion, all inappropriate items should be removed and sent to a more suitable place, so that children can have a proper and beneficial library experience.
957	3934	2	3	@CAPS1 Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines?'          @CAPS2 do people take @CAPS1 books? Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be censored or 'banned'. Why do people believe this should happen? Well, there will be three topics that will be discussed in this essay. The three topics are children, @CAPS4, and religion.          First, '@CAPS3'. Many parents are extremely cautious about their children's exposure to harmful content. They don't want their child to be exposed to violence, vulgar language, or even possible drug - related content. Violence is one of the main concerns in all four types of entertainment. It can have a negative influence on children, potentially leading them to engage in foolish and dangerous behavior. Another issue is vulgar language, which older generations of adults consider disrespectful. In the news, there are constant reports about teens getting involved with drugs, which can lead to overdose and even death.          Second, '@CAPS4'. People around the world, regardless of their skin color or unique features, face the problem of racism. In the past, certain derogatory words were used to label specific groups, suggesting they were inferior. This led to riots and gang - related violence as people fought for equal treatment. Although the situation has improved over time, the remnants of such discrimination still exist.          Third, '@CAPS5'. Religion is a significant aspect of the world, revealing much about the past and people's beliefs. It is often represented in books, movies, music, and magazines. Different people firmly believe that their religious views are the correct ones, which can lead to conflicts. Trying to prevent religious - related content from being banned won't solve the problem because people talk and some may try to convert others to their beliefs.          So back to @CAPS2, would everyone or some take to @CAPS1 books, movies, music, magazines? Well, this content will be exposed sooner or later. We have the option of allowing it now or delaying it. Whether it's better to do it sooner or later is uncertain. But in the end, someone will learn from the experience, so there's no real point in banning it now. In conclusion, rather than banning, we should focus on educating people to understand and respect different forms of content.
958	3935	2	3	Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves                                             In every library, it is essential to have all types of books, movies, and magazines, whether they are good or bad. After all, not everyone in this world has the same preferences. If some people are offended by the sources they find in the library, I don't think those items should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has the right to agree or disagree with the types of things they like.      If libraries didn't offer a diverse range of materials, how would people learn about the real - world issues today? Television doesn't always provide accurate information. Every library in the world should not remove certain books, movies, and magazines just to protect kids or others from accessing them. There might be other people who would like to read or watch @CAPS1. If libraries start removing certain items, they can't really be called libraries anymore, as a library is supposed to be a place with all types of sources.     Not everyone will have the same opinion on whether certain books, movies, or magazines should be in the library. However, all these sources should stay because what is offensive to some may not be offensive to others. It wouldn't be fair to those who enjoy reading, looking at new magazines, watching different movies, or listening to music.     I think that librarians should not remove anything from their libraries. They know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves. Also, if they didn't want people to be offended, they wouldn't have included such materials in the first place.     Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves to intentionally offend people; they leave @CAPS1 for others to read. In conclusion, all types of books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to enable people to learn about the things they are interested in.
959	3936	2	3	I think that they shouldn't remove the censored books in the libraries because older kids can read the books, but not the little kids. Little kids don't need to hear the kind of words in those books. Their ears are too small to fully understand and their eyes are too inexperienced to read such complex and inappropriate words. Older kids, like those in grades @NUM1, should be able to look at the books because they have heard similar words before.          The books shouldn't be in the lower - grade libraries because little kids might check them out. For example, the book called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 says the n - word many times, and another one, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, contains a lot of dirty words like the f - word, s - word, and so on. These are words that kids at a young age don't need to hear.       Another reason why it wouldn't be fair to the older kids if the books are taken away from the libraries is that they are trying to remove the books to prevent little kids from taking them home and reading them. If you are going to take away the books, take them away from the grades @NUM2 because books like @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 And @CAPS5 are not suitable for those kids to read.     Some more reasons why older kids should read the books and little kids shouldn't. Older kids in grade @NUM1 are more mature than little kids. We don't want little kids to go home and repeat those inappropriate words to their parents, grandparents, etc.       Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newspaper about my reflection on why or why not we should get rid of the censorship in the libraries. In conclusion, a proper balance should be maintained, keeping the books accessible to older kids while protecting the little ones from inappropriate content. I hope you liked this persuasive essay for the newspaper, and until the next time I write about this topic.
960	3937	2	3	Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, it's unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are open to multiple interpretations. For example, some poems are written in a way that allows different people to understand them differently based on their own experiences. Moreover, most music and books are created for entertainment purposes rather than to cause offense. Granted, some books are meant to be understood in a specific way, but that still doesn't mean they are intended to offend. Think about it the next time you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, it is usually because it has some educational value. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' offer a great deal of educational value as they show what @CAPS6 culture was like. However, every day, someone tries to get it removed from the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? For me, the answer is no, since the educational value of such books far outweighs their potential offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, ban movies, or remove songs, the problem isn't solved. It's just suppressed, and new problems will arise. There will be people who wanted to read a particular book but can't because it was deemed offensive. When this person complains to the one who banned the literature, the book may be put back on the shelves. Then you might feel like banning it again, but what does that achieve? Nothing. Even if it remains banned, people can still share the knowledge and content of the book, making the ban ineffective.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that leads to a ban affects everyone. It impacts a teacher's ability to teach and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? In conclusion, banning these things is wrong and we should encourage a more open - minded approach to different forms of media.
961	3938	2	3	I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have their own dedicated room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers accessing those kinds of books and magazines, then put a lock on the door. And if you have valid proof of your age that shows you are old enough (at least @NUM1), then you are going to be allowed back there. If you don't have proof of your age, then I guess you're not going back to the adult section. I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not allowed to be seen unless you're @NUM1. The thing is, kids have imaginations, and if you read a book, you can also visualize pictures just like in a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet it's rough when your kid is reading books and picking up bad words from them and saying them around, like to an even younger sibling. Because then that's just going to cause a bigger problem than what you started out with. People have to understand these days that kids are growing up way too fast to just leave stuff like that lying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books, and stuff like that out of reach of kids. I feel like once you become a parent, you automatically think you're smarter than a kid, but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand it's only a word, but it's disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inappropriate things to nice people. When kids do that, other parents who don't let their kids do that stuff think 'wow, these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that it's never going to stop, but it would be better if children's parents didn't let them cuss around other people. Okay, at home, if your parents don't care, then sure. But when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train, it's all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines, and the movies. I'm going to close this little description now, and I'm still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen.
962	3939	2	3	There are many inappropriate types of entertainment in the world, but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies, and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of entertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inappropriate. With censoring materials in a library, it will extremely limit what we can learn. For example, if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches its prey was offensive, then if a person was interested in learning about that topic, they would not be able to. Many people's only way of research is at a library. So, if they had an assignment for work and they could only get information on it there, they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offensive. Also, people in the medical field have to watch many movies demonstrating certain procedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a person's life. With censoring, there would be no diversity. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choice in what we could read for entertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for entertainment because if one person does not like a certain book, it can be gotten rid of. So, if not all the books are gone, there is still going to be only a few books to choose from. It would cause all to read the same books, therefore making the diversity very small. I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inappropriate or offensive things, but that is what is in our world, and I believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, hatred, sexual things, and profanity, but there is no changing that. Censoring might hide that for a small amount of time, but it's not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society. I do not think that we should censor things in our libraries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communities. It is a great idea, but I do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cause a lack in diversity, education, and a realization of our society.
963	3940	2	3	Now, one way or another, that certain piece of material will be found and be used. Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others. So, really, either way you might try to remove any material that you think is offensive, but is it your right? I don't suppose so. I would consider that unfair. It's unfair that you were able to see this material, and just because you thought it was offensive, it does not mean that others might find that offensive in their opinion. So, the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous. For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an advocate for the author of that material. Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers, readers, listeners, etc. to look at and use, would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive. It's a big world out there. You think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see, that no one will find a way. People will always find a way for it to get out or be found. It would be as if you're trying to control what people should be viewing, listening, reading, etc. Almost as if you're in control of people, but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world. Also, that not everybody in this world has the same mindset as you do, and that whatever you find offensive might not, or actually does not mean everyone else does. So, this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or a group of people find offensive. Do not try to control what people or children should view, listen, or read because it will be found sooner or later. No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect, reality is that it won't happen, and you can't keep everything hidden.
964	3941	2	3	Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive, like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from the library's shelf. It should be the parent's choice to what their child can look at or listen to. But these days, when a child's parent or any other authority doesn't let them do, watch, or listen to something, it makes kids want it more. Since they want it more, they will find a way to do, watch, or listen to whatever it might be. They will even go behind their parents' back and probably won't care if they get in trouble. With this new generation, authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it in all different types of ways. Computers, television, and the radio are three different major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents, I do believe, are one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age. That's what makes kids think it's alright when their parents do whatever it may be. So, let it be the parent's choice of what their child can see. Because either way, they're going to be able to find a way to get it. In the end, we should trust parents to make the right decisions for their children rather than removing potentially offensive materials from public access.
965	3942	2	3	Things that mean so much to just one person. To start this off, I am going to say Katherine Paterson is saying / advocating what is correct. There's a lot of people around this world that are very sensitive about their things in their house and around their life that they wouldn't want anyone to touch or be around. One important thing that I have that means so much to me and my family is the recording that my grandfather gave to us right before he passed away. Me and my family have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time, but we just can't get the nerve to do it. We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that recording and just grab ahold of it. I and my family do not like that. So, we say something. That's one thing that we don't like for anyone to touch because it means so much to us! Most people think we are crazy because we don't like anyone to be around or touch it, but all I have to say is that there are other people around this area that are more crazy about their things being touched. For example: 'Don't be over there by my clock hanging on the wall. I don't want you to knock it off, so get away from it!' That is something that my best friend's mom had said before, and she still feels the same way still to this day! But I mean it's just how we feel about everything around us that means a lot. But to get back to the situation about why do people get so frustrated about things that are hanging on the wall, or things that are in cases and that's where they have been for years and years. It's because it means so much to them. It's not just because they're mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe. It's just because it means so much to them. And when I say means a lot to them, I mean a whole bunch! They're just trying to say that it means more than anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered. Just try to understand what they're trying to say to you. Because it could mean so much, and you could get to the point to watch out for it also, just to help out. But the story that Katherine Paterson had written is saying the right thing. And she also probably has things in her life too that means a lot to her. You just have to recognize what she has that is so important because there is a lot of people that have important things in their life, and you could be one of them. Just try to see and feel how a lot of other people do around the world around you. Just have to remember what's important to someone and help keep an eye out with them. And be a good friend to everybody else. In conclusion, we should respect what is important to others, as we all have things that hold great significance in our lives.
966	3943	2	3	What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of the library, where they can stay, leisurely read the newspaper, and listen to music. If you find certain materials offensive, then simply don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas about what a library should be, and if they want their voices heard, they should speak up.   What I think about all the diverse materials in the library these days is that they are beneficial for kids. These resources allow them to learn at a faster pace and give them more to anticipate as they grow older. In my own experiences in the library, I've noticed that there are more people frequenting the place, and there are many activities besides just reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when you're home alone or have no one to hang out with. Reading only books can get boring, so it's a good idea to try something different for a while and then go back to the book you started and took a break from.   Then again, other people have the right to voice their opinions if they don't want certain things in their library. Some of my observations haven't been very positive. I've seen protesters in front of libraries, and I've witnessed libraries being closed down because of such protests. Unfortunately, some people take things too far and may even burn the library to the ground. I've seen people crying over these incidents, and it really upsets me. I want to do something to help them, but I feel helpless.   The most valuable users of libraries are the kids and young children who read the books. Imagine if someone burned down your home; that's how these kids feel when you close down the safest place for them. They have the most powerful collective voice. If you can do something to make them feel better, it would be a great thing for them. They haven't done anything to deserve the mess we put them through. It's difficult for them to find a proper place to read when there are no available libraries.   If you don't want to stay quiet, then let your voice be heard around the world and exercise your freedom of speech. You have three different voices to consider: your own, the voices of others who may or may not agree with you, and the voices of your children. So, which one will you listen to? When you have a choice to make, hope that you make the right one.
967	3944	2	3	"Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate aspects of the world? Should you prevent them from hearing, seeing, or reading about the bad things in the world, allowing them to grow up as innocent as possible? Should libraries take such precautions?   In a world like ours, where bad things happen every day, such as people committing suicide, being murdered, government scams, and even terrorist attacks, it's challenging to keep those who shouldn't know from finding out. It's very easy for people in our nation to learn about these things. All we have to do is watch TV or even visit our local library. While we already censor what goes on our television, we don't pay as much attention to censoring the content in our libraries. Our libraries house thousands of books and magazines, and now they also have an equal or greater number of movies, audiobooks, and videogames.   I think a library should implement censorship when it comes to what it offers and how it organizes its collection. There should be different sections in libraries, similar to how it is now, based on age groups and what is appropriate for each group. To prevent people from checking out items from sections meant for older age groups, there should be an age - group security check in the library's card filing system. This may sound very complicated, but at least we're doing our best to avoid exposing anyone to content they're too young for.   When it comes to offensive material, I think it shouldn't be removed from the library but rather placed in a different area. Some people may need to read something they find offensive. Maybe they need it for a class, or perhaps the book, although offensive, teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book called ""**[Title]**"" written by a man with the last name of **[Author's Last Name]**. It may sound very offensive, but it actually teaches people the origin of a particular word and how it became offensive to people. It may be offensive for some to read, but it imparts a lesson on why people shouldn't use that word.   Yes, there are always some parents who don't care as much about what their child reads, watches, listens to, or plays. However, for their kids to access such content, the parents will have to come and get it for them. That way, the parents are aware of what they're borrowing from the library. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library censorship, considering both the rights of readers and the protection of children, is essential."
968	3945	2	3	We all find things offensive, whether it's in a book, magazine, movie, CD, TV show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of these items, and some people may or may not want to remove the items they think are offensive. But would that be the right thing to do? If everyone went to the library and removed everything they thought was offensive from the shelves, we'd have nothing left.   Maybe writers should reduce the use of inappropriate, racist, or foul - language elements in their works. Then, fewer people would be offended, and they wouldn't have any concerns about letting their children pick out books independently. However, it may not be the writers' fault. It could be the readers. Some people should stop taking everything so seriously. Then, they wouldn't have to worry about what their children are reading.   Yes, most adult - oriented content is inappropriate for children, but that's why it's intended for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. Parents need to realize that they should take their kids to the children's section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age, and people should start paying more attention to these categorizations. If parents start monitoring what their kids do, they won't have to worry about their children reading or watching something they shouldn't. That's what parents are supposed to do: take care of their children, and some people don't do a very good job of it.   If there's a book you read and you don't want your child to read it, it's likely something you read when you were older. So, don't worry about it until they reach that age. Maybe by then, it would be okay for them to read it because they're old enough to distinguish right from wrong. Parents can't always control what their children do. And if their children happen to pick up a book their parents never wanted them to read, they may view it differently from their parents and learn a very valuable lesson from it. In conclusion, a combination of responsible writing, parental supervision, and allowing children some freedom to explore can create a healthy reading environment.
969	3946	2	3	When going to a library, you expect to see a wide variety of books, movies, music, magazines, and perhaps other items. If a person is looking for a book that might be offensive to a race, culture, religion, or other aspects, they should still be able to check out that book. Libraries shouldn't be able to control such situations because it's an individual's or an adult's choice to read those kinds of stories.   In our country, we are allowed to express our opinion by the Constitution. The Constitution includes the right to free speech, which ensures that anyone can express their personal feelings or opinions on certain matters. If a person wants to check out a book that could offend another individual, technically, by the law, they have the right to do so. I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or watch movies that are hateful or cruel, but according to the law, it's acceptable for people to choose to read, listen, or watch such works.   Libraries are government - funded organizations. This means they don't have the right to disregard these works. The government pays for the books that are purchased for the library. They need to have books that people want to read and are interested in, even though some groups of people might not agree. It's their job to provide a diverse collection.   I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the United States, we are allowed to listen to what we want and read anything we want because that's what our country stands for: freedom. When I think of America, I think of freedom, and I'm proud that our country stands for that. We should uphold that freedom even in the small aspects of life, such as library access. In conclusion, while offensive materials may be uncomfortable, the principle of freedom of access in libraries should be maintained.
970	3947	2	3	You've asked me to write an essay for a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries. Well, okay then. You might not like what I have to say, but I really don't care. If it were up to your darn government to decide what we can say, what we can read, or even what we can do, they'd have us all stuck in our houses with our hands tied, only able to learn how to eat, clean, and dress ourselves.   The way I see it, we have every right to read any book we please, whenever we want to read it. If we don't want to read a book, then we don't have to. But we, as a people, and the government do not have the right to remove books from the libraries. We, as a people, can express anything we want, regardless of what the government thinks. It is the people who run the state, not the darn government.   My point is that books are there to teach us about our lives and our history. They teach us what is wrong and what is right. Books are not just for scary stories by a campfire or bedtime stories for kids. If we take those books off our shelves, you think the kids of your generation are bad. Just wait; the next one will be worse, I promise you that.   It is our right to save our books. If we don't, we, as a society, will be lost. Without books, our past is lost, our folk tales are forgotten, and our kids won't be able to sleep at night without their stories.   Come on, guys. Let's all pull it together. If you see a book on the shelves and you think it's offensive, then by all means, put the darn thing down and walk away from it. Don't complain about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So, don't ruin it for everyone. If you don't believe in [Religious Belief] and you think the Bible isn't right, then don't touch it. It's the same way around. If you do believe in [Religious Belief] and you think that all books about witches, vampires, or that even have a brothel in them are bad, just leave them alone. It's just a darn book. Let us read them. You guys blame us kids that video games rot our minds, but really, it's the parents. You see, there's nothing more a teenager like myself loves to do than to do something their mom or dad says not to. So, just back off and let us read, play, and do what the heck we want to do. In conclusion, censorship in libraries restricts our freedom and the growth of our society, and we should oppose it.
971	3948	2	3	Many people have diverse preferences when it comes to different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some individuals take offense to these various forms of media, while others do not. For me, I firmly stand on the side of non - offense. I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because there are different types tailored for different types of people. If a person takes offense from a book or magazine, I believe that person should simply put it back on the shelf. If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves, there would be no books left on the shelves because I'm sure there's at least one person in the world that would take offense to each and every book. After all, there are a large number of people in the world. For music, there's a wide variety of genres too. There's rap, country, rock, pop and many more. For example, if someone likes rap but not country, that person has the clear - cut choice to listen to rap and not country. If that person doesn't like country, though, it shouldn't be removed because others genuinely like country and want to listen to it. For movies, there are numerous different types as well. There's horror, comedy, romance and many more. That's precisely why at the theater there are different rooms dedicated to different movies. People always have a choice. Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them although some don't. Every person is different. People like different things. That is, in my opinion, the true beauty of human nature. It allows for a rich tapestry of experiences and perspectives.
972	3949	2	3	The views on censorship in libraries definitely vary significantly from person to person. There are those who are deeply offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who strongly want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are both pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of reasonable censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere. The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of the opposite sex or intense action moments filled with violence, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to. The easy access to the library is indeed part of the problem. Someone of any age can easily get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of. If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people truly want. Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This may be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to? Although to some people this argument can go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world might come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger negative effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want. By setting appropriate boundaries, we can create a healthier library environment for all.
973	3950	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and so on should be removed? Yes, I firmly think that they should all be removed because it could seriously hurt people's feelings, and could make them do plenty of harmful things. Such as leading to thoughts of suicide, causing unnecessary drama, and so on. Having any of these things at a library could deeply hurt someone's feelings. I really don't think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book, so why would anyone else? I think that by removing all these things could make some people's lives better. From experience in the library last week, I saw this young girl that ran to her mom crying because she was African - American, and the book said something extremely derogatory about their race. And she was all worried that what happened back in the day with all the slavery would happen again. I would be so terrified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me. That kind of thing would just ruin my day. Now I think that libraries would learn to take this certain offensive stuff out of stock. Now that I have given you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience. I think that they should take my advice, and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids, teenagers, or even adults. They should not be reading that stuff. All it does is bring some people down, make them cry, and also lead to some stupid and harmful actions. Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be a smart decision, and make things better for everyone. It would create a more inclusive and respectful library environment.
974	3951	2	3	Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are completely empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages, to get lost in the enchanting worlds created by words. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new and different views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind - blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being gradually taken over by modern technology. A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of proper resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that might interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want. Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they might not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individual's beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought. Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn. By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn. We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology. However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourages kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are suppressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non - effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial than the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However, a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive - bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more than they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish. It would be a disservice to the development of young minds.
975	3952	2	3	First of all, I firmly believe if it's on the shelf you should be able to get it, no matter what your age is. Yeah, there are things that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know whether to get that or not. If kids aren't allowed to get certain material on the shelves, then it shouldn't be there, in my opinion. Parents might think differently. Parents might think only certain things should be allowed at a library. But it's not their sole choice though. Anything is allowed to be at a library. If you don't want your kid reading or getting certain things, then when your kid goes to the library go with them. Help them pick out a book. Guide them to make appropriate choices. In conclusion, I believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf, whether you're a kid or if you're an adult. If you're not allowed to get it, then why is it there? I don't know, I couldn't answer that question, other than to ask again, why is it there? It just doesn't make sense. This is my opinion though, and it's about respecting the freedom of access in a library.
976	3953	2	3	@CAPS1 are you reading? asked mom. I immediately hid the book behind my back, well - aware that she wouldn't approve of me delving into such an in - depth book. Some parents simply don't want their kids exposed to certain content. If it's not acceptable at home, then it shouldn't be allowed at school either. There are subjects that perhaps we shouldn't encounter, yet we do because our parents have set boundaries. Removing these subjects would eliminate the risk of disobeying our parents and imitating behaviors from books.  There are books, movies, magazines, and music that are considered 'cool', but not all of them are appropriate. Some movies and music are filled with offensive language and actions that kids tend to pick up on and mimic from actors, actresses, and artists. Soon enough, they start to gain a reputation by using such language or actions and end up being known as the 'bad kid'. Students like me, who aren't popular or easily noticed, feel the urge to do things to stand out. Most of what students imitate are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as through the media.  It is a wise decision to implement censors in libraries for students. Although some students may not necessarily want censorship in libraries, it is in their best interest to remove offensive materials. It will make students, including myself, better individuals by not being exposed to the things we often hear about or watch. I believe that using censorship will assist students in making the right decision at home and avoid getting involved in such inappropriate things.  I've noticed that students frequently observe how movie stars and famous people act. If they're fans of a particular famous person, they're more likely to model after them and copy their actions. Let's say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. As a fan, I'd either find someone else to look up to or, unfortunately, think it's 'cool' and do as she did. If I were to do what @PERSON2 did, my parents would probably be extremely angry, and if I somehow got lucky and they didn't punish me severely, I'd surely end up in jail.  So, in conclusion, I firmly believe that censorship is crucial in libraries as it ensures the well - being of students and shields them from things they don't need to be exposed to. I would whole - heartedly respect the implementation of censorship in my school because I know it's there to help me. I sincerely hope that all students can recognize the importance of not being subjected to violence, sex, drugs, and drama through movies, music, magazines, or books.
977	3954	2	3	I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, @CAPS7 because it's not fair to everybody. If censorship was implemented everywhere, there probably wouldn't be any movies or anything entertaining available, given that a large number of people would have complaints. I have a few reasons why I think there should not be censorship in libraries.  The first reason is freedom of the press. In our @ORGANIZATION1, we are granted the right to write what we desire. If censorship persists, we will lose one of our fundamental rights. I don't think it's fair to control what we want to write or read.  Another reason is freedom of speech. Also enshrined in our @ORGANIZATION1 of @ORGANIZATION1, we have the right to say what we want, and no one can restrict that. If we continue to use censorship, this right will also be taken away from us. We're gradually losing our @CAPS1 given rights, @CAPS7 because some people are offended by books and similar materials.  A personal experience I had was one day when a friend and I went to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be about the @DATE1's and slavery. Unfortunately, my friend was @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and he found it difficult not to be offended by the assignment. When we reached the library, the situation worsened. All the books we found described how terribly the slaves were treated back then.  My friend was getting extremely upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, and then he approached the librarian and asked, '@CAPS4, can you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just stared at him with a straight face and replied, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' My friend was shocked. He couldn't believe what he had just heard.  After he came back to where I was sitting, I told him that she was right. '@CAPS6's that?', he asked. I said, '@CAPS7 if she had removed all those books, she would have had to take almost every other book down too, @CAPS7 because somebody would find something offensive.' 'You know, you're probably right,' he said.  Censorship isn't fair, @CAPS7 because it restricts our abilities and the things we enjoy. It's not just to control what we read, write, or say. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours were taken away?
978	3955	2	3	Some people often visit the library to check out books, movies, magazines, etc. But what some might not realize is that some of the items in the library could be offensive to certain individuals. I firmly believe that everything in the libraries should remain there. Obviously, the library allowed these items for a reason, so they can't be that bad.  I do not think certain things should be removed from the library. People need to understand that this is life. There will always be things we don't like, but we have to accept them. If you watch TV, you'll notice that there are some offensive elements towards certain groups. However, no one makes a big deal out of it.  The books might be offensive to you, but to someone else, they could just be another book they want to read, without any intention of causing offense. The library is a place for learning, and everything there serves an educational purpose. I've read books where I paused and thought about some rather harsh content, but I didn't complain; I just continued reading.  A lot of books are based on true events. So, no matter how offensive they may seem to some people, we should consider the author's purpose in creating the book, and the same goes for movies. It's so that people can understand the author's perspective. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion, and that's what most magazine articles are about - expressing thoughts on a particular topic.  Even in the @CAPS1 class I'm in now, we had to read 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3'. Some @CAPS4 @CAPS5 people might think it's racist, but it really isn't. The author is trying to convey his point about how things used to be before white and colored people were treated equally. Now, if you still think it's offensive to you or others, that's okay. This is a free country, and everyone has the right to express how they feel without getting in trouble.  So, I hope I've made it clear that it's okay for some things to be offensive to people, as long as that's not the main purpose of what you're watching or reading, which I doubt it is. So, the next time you're reading or watching something that offends you, think about the point the person who wrote or made the movie was trying to convey. Maybe by being offended, you're actually understanding the message.
979	3956	2	3	Censorship can be a very beneficial measure. It prevents inappropriate material from falling into the wrong hands and keeps the disturbing content in censored materials out of the community, thus creating a better living environment. However, excessive censorship can turn into a negative thing. For instance, @ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning books. There are also several books that discuss how the idea of censorship can get out of control, like the book @CAPS1 @NUM1. Libraries should indeed censor some of their materials.  Books and magazines need to be censored according to their content. Both books and magazines use words and sometimes pictures to convey their messages. If a book uses vulgar and inappropriate language, it should be censored in some way. For example, I shouldn't be able to pick up a book and find sexual dialog right away. I also shouldn't encounter the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine. Moreover, many people are offended by violence and excessive gore. Magazines and books also use pictures to enhance their points. If there are inappropriate pictures in either of these sources, the material should be censored. If I'm walking through my local library and see a magazine with a nude picture on the front, I'll definitely question the library's censorship policy. Similarly, if I pick up a book and find an inappropriate picture inside, I'll wonder about the library's standards. Also, if a magazine has an extremely violent or gory picture, it should be censored. Overall, if a book or magazine is extremely inappropriate, it should, in some form, be censored.  Music is another form of media available in libraries that should be censored. Musicians use album sleeve artwork to attract people's attention. If that artwork contains swear words or inappropriate pictures, it should be censored in some way. Musicians, of course, play music. But if the lyrics of their songs are explicit or have many sexual themes, they must be censored. No one should have to endure listening to such music. No matter what, if an album of music is extremely inappropriate, it should be censored.  Movies are probably the most challenging things to censor. This is because they incorporate language, pictures, music, and video. Movies are multi - media entities that can sometimes be very clean and sometimes extremely inappropriate. If a movie is rated @CAPS2, it should not be in a public library. Movies rated @CAPS3 for sexual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored. A child should not have access to such movies in a public library. Also, depending on how violent and gory a movie is, it should be censored.  The fact that this debate about censorship even needs to happen is quite sad. But it does, so we must censor certain things that people @MONTH1 find offensive in public libraries. Materials containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence should possibly be censored. There also needs to be a limit to censorship; otherwise, as Katherine Paterson said, we won't have any books left. Overall, there needs to be a reasonable level of censorship in public libraries.
980	3957	2	3	As an individual, based on the books I've read, I firmly believe that some books should be removed from library shelves. My main concern is for the children who might get their hands on these books. Kids should be able to enjoy their childhood and wait until they're older and more mature to be exposed to certain things. This applies not only to books but also to music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe that these forms of media can influence bad behavior such as stealing, cussing, and even murder. By reducing the amount of obscene material, we can better control our kids, or at least have a positive impact on some of them.  We witness bad behavior every day, like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Have you ever wondered what causes people to engage in such actions? Just look around; these behaviors are often depicted in movies, discussed in books, and even mentioned in songs. It's no wonder that kids think it's okay to do these things. If we limit access to these items, we @MONTH1 will likely see positive results.  As I mentioned earlier, kids should be allowed to be kids and be shielded from obscene materials. They will inevitably be exposed to such things at some point, but hopefully when they're older and better equipped to handle them. In the meantime, censors should be placed on these items or they should be removed from the shelves. This way, we can create a safer and more appropriate environment for our children to grow and learn.
981	3958	2	3	"Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldn't have? Well, of course, I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazines that young children should not read, hear, or watch. These kinds of things can have a negative impact on our everyday living.  Let's start with a book that contains scenes of killing. I'm not a parent at present, but I'm certain that I wouldn't want my children reading about such violence. That's not something a twelve - year - old child should be exposed to. Those kinds of books could lead kids to think, ""Oh, he killed someone, why couldn't I?"" And that's how some kids grow up to be involved in bad behavior and end up in jail at a young age, like @NUM1, because they've either killed someone or at least attempted to. There are also other books that some children shouldn't read, such as those about slavery. If a mother doesn't want her child to know about slavery at their current age, there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten - year - old to access. If I had family members who lived in the slavery days, I definitely wouldn't want my kids to read about it, as it shows how white people disrespected the blacks, and that could have an adverse effect on the child, potentially causing them to develop negative feelings towards white people.  Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't stock all the inappropriate music that's on the radio, but I'm sure there's some music that has references to stealing. That's another thing that could give kids the wrong idea and set them on the wrong path. There are just some things children shouldn't hear unless they're with a parent, and then the parent can explain that they shouldn't do what the song says. But such music shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.  The third thing is movies. There should never be any movies depicting killing, breaking into people's houses, or fighting in a school library. School is not the place for a child to watch such content. It just gives a young child the wrong impression and is not appropriate for schools to have.  The last one is magazines. There shouldn't be magazines in school showing women in bathing suits or men without shirts. That could make a kid think they can do the same and get themselves into serious trouble.  In conclusion, we need to be more vigilant about what is available in libraries. By removing inappropriate books, music, movies, and magazines, we can create a safer and more suitable environment for children."
982	3959	2	3	If there are any books, movies, music, or magazines that are offensive, then I firmly believe they should be removed from the bookshelf as a precaution for little kids. Everyone has different preferences when it comes to movies, books, or music, but we all need to understand where kids pick up certain behaviors from. The books can remain on the shelf if younger kids aren't likely to access them. We must recognize that adults don't always want to watch kids' shows. There should be a provision that allows adults to remove books from the shelf if they're not suitable for their kids.  Yes, offensive books, magazines, movies, and music should be kept off the shelf. This is necessary because kids can watch offensive movies and develop bad habits, listen to inappropriate music and pick up bad words, and look at magazines with inappropriate pictures. So, we need to keep kids away from offensive materials.  There are many younger kids who are prone to getting into things they shouldn't. For example, they might be attracted to bad movies that aren't suitable for their age, as kids often learn bad habits from TV shows or movies. If a movie is offensive, it should definitely be kept off the shelves, unless there are only grown - ups in the house. If movies are lying around on the shelf or in the house, younger kids could easily grab them without knowing what they are and watch them in their rooms.  Horrible music is equally bad, as kids can pick up bad language from the lyrics. If parents don't want their kids growing up to be bad people, I advise all parents to keep the worst music away from children and hide it. They can hide it in their rooms, in a desk drawer for the safety of the children. All kids should stay away from offensive and bad items they're not allowed to be around.  Magazines can also be inappropriate if they have pictures that aren't suitable for children. Parents should watch their children around magazines or look through the magazines before allowing them to read. There might be disgusting pictures that children shouldn't see at a young age. So, make sure they stay clear and far away from such magazines.  In conclusion, we should always keep offensive items away from young children. By being vigilant and taking appropriate measures, we can protect kids from the negative influence of offensive books, movies, music, and magazines.
983	3960	2	3	In a way, many books are placed on the library shelf for a purpose. However, some of these books take themes like race, sexism, and bullying to an extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes, reading such books, or being exposed to offensive movies, music, or magazines would be terrifying. The language used in movies and music is often not what we'd like children to be exposed to. Would you want your @NUM1 - year - old child to imitate the actions of other @NUM1 - year - olds just because they think it's cool?  Remember the days when you were young, and your parents didn't have to worry constantly about what you were doing because the media was less saturated with negative content? Well, if we don't take action now, the situation for future generations will likely get worse. These offensive materials are essentially telling children that it's okay to have sex, smoke, drink, or cuss.  I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3. She's always calling me to check on me, asking how my day was, or if I had any problems. If we all work together to eliminate profanities from our media, I'm sure the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying would no longer be a major issue, and problems in cyberspace, as well as the use of drugs and alcohol, would decrease. You need to take a stand and show your children that these behaviors are unacceptable and unnecessary in life. Remind them that there's a whole life out there without the influence of sex, drugs, and profanities.  So, the next time you're about to buy a DVD or a CD, preview it first. Make sure that if your child were to listen to it or watch it, it wouldn't be harmful or contain any profanities. Have an open conversation with your child about what's right and wrong. Let's work towards making profanities disappear on their own. If it's not something you want your child to be exposed to, then you shouldn't engage with it either.  In conclusion, by being more aware of the media we consume and the messages we expose our children to, we can create a better and safer world for everyone.
984	3961	2	3	"Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read and want to reread? You search shelf after shelf, but you can't find it anywhere. You've looked under every possible listing, checked both paperbacks and hardbacks, and eventually, frustration takes over. Giving up on finding the novel, you approach the librarian and ask about it. She replies, ""I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel because someone found it offensive."" You're outraged, and you decide to write an article for your local newspaper about the removal of offensive books, movies, music, etc. from the library.  Personally, I don't think that media removed from the library should be considered offensive. How can we objectively determine what is offensive and what isn't? A book might be offensive to one person but not to another. Different people have different opinions, and it's not reasonable to remove a book or other media from a library just because it contains ""offensive material."" It's ridiculous, and it infuriates me that someone would take such action. If you think an item could get into the hands of a child or someone it might affect, simply don't rent it. That's why most libraries have separate areas for adults and children to prevent children from accessing inappropriate items.  How can we determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me doesn't mean I'll request it to be banned so that others can't enjoy it. If you find something offensive, just leave it alone. Don't bother or hassle someone who had nothing to do with its creation. It's not only disrespectful to the person you file a complaint with but also to the artist who created it. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, it's better to keep it to yourself.  We live in a rather closed - minded world. There are people who think it's inappropriate to show even an arm. I can understand why some people take offense to certain things, but it's rather petty to report something just because you don't agree with it. We have a good sense of what's right or wrong, what's appropriate for an audience to hear. If something weren't appropriate, would it have been published in the first place? Sure, there are inappropriate elements in books, music, etc., but being so closed - minded as to have something banned due to foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is illogical. You can encounter worse things just by walking down the street.  In conclusion, we should respect different opinions and the freedom of expression. Instead of banning offensive media, we should educate people to make their own choices and be more tolerant."
985	3962	2	3	"Imagine someone coming up to you and saying, ""@CAPS1, what are you reading there? Wait, I know that book! It's absolutely offensive! How dare you read that!"" Then, they snatch the book away, and you never see it again. This is exactly how censorship works. If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to take it away? Absolutely not!  Everybody should have the right to decide for themselves what is right or wrong to watch, read, or hear. If a person really wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they'll find it, regardless of whether it's legal or not. Therefore, trying to stop people from accessing such content is a futile effort.  Remember the wonderful bedtime story, ""@CAPS2 The @ORGANIZATION2""? Well, you can't read it anymore because the government declared it offensive to camels and took it away. Now, you're left with only a boring book on camel facts. How much fun is that? And I can't help but think, ""What about the authors?"" One of the most amazing things about our country is our freedom of speech and expression! Stopping the creativity of our authors through government censorship is both tough and cruel. Writing a great story becomes nearly impossible with the limitations that could result from such censorship.  If a song is beautiful and sweet but contains one bad word, is it a bad song? If there were censorship, who would decide what is appropriate? Would the @CAPS5 make the decision for us? Or would the @ORGANIZATION1 get together and read aloud the books before declaring them inappropriate? Personally, I'd prefer to decide for myself. As a mature adult, I have the morals and the ability to choose what's good or bad.  It's possible that the multitude of books and songs we have now could disappear completely. It's incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on entertainment. This could lead to the elimination of many forms of entertainment. So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment?  Understanding that there are young, impressionable children exposed to all forms of public entertainment, some censorship might be necessary. However, I firmly believe this should be limited. Censorship should only be used to protect kids, similar to how a parent guides their children to eat healthy food while they're growing up. When the kids are grown, they can decide for themselves what food to eat. Some of the items I believe should be censored are public commercials, children's television shows, and children's movies. The things I, and many others, believe should be censored are profanity, violence, and offensiveness towards race, religion, and gender.  In conclusion, while some limited censorship for the protection of children is understandable, we should not let it stifle our freedom of expression and creativity. We should encourage a balance where adults can make their own choices, and children are protected in a reasonable way."
986	3963	2	3	Many libraries today have strict limits on what they can put on their shelves. Yes, there is indeed offensive material out there in the world, but it's often just artists trying to make a name for themselves by pushing boundaries. If we start controlling each other's thoughts, feelings, and artistic abilities, where will that leave our rapidly expanding culture? Libraries should not have the right to censor material. One way to appeal to everyone's demands would be to divide the library into two major sections: children's and adults. Then, you could continue dividing the sections further. Doing this would be cost - effective, and adding an age limit in the adult section so that no noisy children could get in would be a great idea. It would also help in making it easier to find the right book. Censorship is defined as taking out a particular item that's either offensive to a certain group or is banned. If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other pieces of work, we wouldn't be where we are today. If you take out material, you never know where it could go or what it could lead someone to. Censorship holds back many artists' true potential. Limiting someone's knowledge could hurt that person's chance at becoming something in this world. I have read many books that are offensive in some ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence, and there's no real difference in their value. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all too well: if someone has the right to remove a book from the shelf, then everyone has the right to remove a material off a shelf, and so there would be no books left. Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but also hurts everyone else. Libraries should not censor any material. Censoring material hurts everyone's yearning for an open mind or a better understanding of something. As Katherine Paterson's quote goes, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 explains that if one person has the right to take a material off a shelf, then everyone else has that right. Censorship shouldn't be in libraries as it goes against the very essence of a free and open society.
987	3964	2	3	Is it offensive? Should people have the right to take down other people's ideas? What do you think? I think not. For centuries, people have been writing, making videos, and creating all types of music. Some consider it a freedom of speech. Others might think of it as being rebellious or a conspiracy. I believe @CAPS1 are exceptional writers, promising producers, and talented artists. But not all medias are good. Over a long period of time, young children have been influenced by medias such as books, movies, music, etc. It's perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media. But that's not all. @CAPS1, there are more cases than just children that are suffering. There are also issues related to religion, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups. There should be certain rules and certain laws that are against such wrong - doings. But everyone is entitled to their opinion. Hundreds of people are discriminated against because of what they hear and see in the medias. A life - changing experience for me was the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This could be considered offensive to lots of people, such as those of African - American descent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse. This is just a few issues with freedom of speech, but there will always be disagreements and different views of opinion. But I for one believe that there's just certain stuff that shouldn't be allowed to be put out into public media as it can cause harm and division in society.
988	3965	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2. Is it wrong to ban a book? It has come to my notice that this is exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive. To this I disagree. The world is a better place to live when everyone has a level playing field. Some information is sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the subject itself. Our country is based on a freedom of press and speech. To deny that is to deny our livelihood as a country. To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time is right from a guardian's viewpoint. Our country has many problems, but a few of them are at the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6. In the @CAPS6, it is stated that we have the freedom of press and speech. This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter. This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips. There was just an example of this inside the @LOCATION1, when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6. However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some. The world is a constantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant. This is the exact same for information of all types. No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future. At this moment, many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation. The only problem with this is the ease at which this type of information can be gotten. The internet is the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad. To block all of this information just can't be done, but to restrict it is our only hope. To create such a restriction, our library needs to have a type of checks and balances system that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections. A perfect example of this would be off of '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13' when @CAPS10 was not allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher. That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age. As humans, we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading. To block any part of this experience is to block our full potential. Many things are offensive, but then again, much of life is offensive. Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information. This is a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them. We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children. To do this, we must create a program that allows those that want to view what they want, and those that are too young to view what they are allowed by their guardians, thus striking a balance between freedom and protection.
989	3966	2	3	I'm okay with censorship on reading materials. I understand that the people selling the products want to appeal to the eye and make people buy what they are selling. I have a lot of experience with this because I read a lot of car magazines, and they sometimes have a lot of models in them. But I'm your average seventeen - year - old, and I'm okay with this too, but there is a limit. My school is very good about this. They see one flag it and put it in the back, but they still let you read it. I like this because it keeps the bad apples off the shelf. I have a very good relationship with my mom and dad. They do tell me what I can get. But if it's ninety - five percent cars and only five percent models, they are okay with that. I said something about a limit. All things have a limit, like how much horsepower stock parts can take on a car before they break. I have a limit on what I buy since I'm not yet eighteen. I can only buy car magazines, but don't get me wrong, I love cars and have since I was little. This way, censorship helps me stay within appropriate boundaries while still allowing me to pursue my interests.
990	3967	2	3	What is offensive? How do we know what offends people? I mean, everyone is different, and everyone has their own thoughts and beliefs. So how are we supposed to know what offends who? The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination. Those types of things would offend most people, I think, but you can never be too sure. Books will always be books, though, and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always say what they want, but not everyone can get what they want. People need to come to their senses and understand that concept. If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of written or vocal recording offends someone, then do not read, listen to, or watch that item. No one can make someone watch or listen to something that offends them. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases. Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend at least one person in the world we live in. But to be honest, do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? So I believe that if it offends a person, then they will not take it off the shelf, and if they do, then that is their own personal problem. People can not tell others what they can or can not write or record. It is their life, and they should be allowed to express themselves, as long as it doesn't cause direct harm. We should respect the diversity of opinions and expressions in a free society.
991	3968	2	3	"Isn't there a well - known saying in the world called ""it's a free country""? I thought that while there are a great many things that people probably shouldn't see in the world, we still find ways to see them anyway, regardless of what they are. The world has so many sources to obtain the truth, or perhaps even lies, about the world we live in. From the media, to the press, to paparazzi, and maybe even from the people around you, they all contribute to the spread of things that perhaps shouldn't be seen by the public. There are things out there that we, the people, know nothing about because the government and the world shield them from our eyes. Then there are the things that the world shows us, like what happened to @PERSON1. A large number of people think what happened to him is offensive. Not only that, but racism in general, and also the news. Why would people put violent things on the news, like murder stories, kidnappings, robberies, and many more? People find that offensive and even scary to a lot of folks, yet we keep such content on.  So, no, I don't think offensive things should be removed from shelves or wherever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supporters and protestors were near his funeral, chanting offensive things like ""thank god for dead soldiers"" and ""god hates the army"". Nobody stopped that. If we, as people, are not going to come together and work with one another regarding what should or should not be displayed, then what's the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when you're going to end up doing the same thing without a care in the world, not thinking about who you're hurting. Everyone has an opinion and wants to demand it, but people are different, and some will always see things differently than you do.  So, if you see something offensive in a book, movie, or outside, don't watch it, don't read it, don't try to hear about it from a friend or a stranger. Just leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave them alone. And then you wouldn't have even known about them. Live life and don't worry about the negative. Let's focus on the positive of what you see."
992	3969	2	3	Can I read this?' People all around the world have asked this or been asked this question. People have their own right to read what they want, but are the children allowed to? There are books that children or young adults should read and should not read. This situation varies as it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut, and violence in books that children should not read.  In high school, there are some books like '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' that have cursing in it. For high schoolers of @NUM1 or older, it will be alright to read. High schoolers understand and have heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a @NUM2 grader, they would not understand the full potential it holds for learning. Children in that age range will not understand that the man is handicapped, then the children would not understand the killing the handicapped man had done or why his friend killed him after it.  Will a parent let a @NUM3 - year - old read a smut novel? This depends on the way the parent was raised and how they feel it will affect the child's development. An @PERSON1 book would not be appropriate for a child of that age because the child does not, and will not, understand the book itself. The book is more than just that one part of smut. There is a gothic and romantic way of writing in @PERSON1 books. A child of @NUM3 years old would not have developed the mature way of thinking about the book.  Violence! '@CAPS4 is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This saying is said but it's not followed. Young adults play video games, read school - related books about violence. '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is a book of a colored teenager going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elementary school would think it's funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will see it as a game and do not have enough background or maturity to understand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a TV show with hitting or punching, the child will think it is okay to do it.  Overall, there will be violence, cursing, and smut novels out there. The thing is, it depends on the parents and the maturity level of the person/child. There is a right and wrong way to handle it, but for people, it's not right to let some underage kids read books with cursing, violence, or smut.
993	3970	2	3	Almost everyone has a movie they would like to see, or a book they would like to read. What happens if they take a trip to the library, and check the catalog, only to find out it had been removed from the system because of bad language or mild themes? I firmly believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read. Some parents don't allow any offensive material at all while others don't mind it. Also, the books and movies for adults are quite different from children's books and movies. It would not be fair to remove offensive books, music, or magazines from the shelf because different people like different content.  Today, we live in a world full of violence and it is going to be hard to avoid violence and offensive material. For some people, they want to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or they even like it. First of all, different people consider the same content differently, and the titles being removed may not be judged fairly. The people who want to see the latest movies that just came out are usually going to see some type of violence. With more advanced computers and technology, there can be more special effects and more violence added to movies more easily. In books, they may have old language that isn't up to the standards of today. For example, in the past, when the word 'gay' used to mean happy. It is a whole different word now and it appears in a lot of old books and songs. Some people may find that offensive and some may not.  Adult content is very different from children's content. Adults have movies and music based on real - life situations and stories while most children's content is based on the alphabet and sing - alongs. There are also the more grown - up kid movies like @ORGANIZATION1's '@CAPS1.' This one is based in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 training to be a hero. During his fights, he kills the creatures that he fights. So if the libraries started censoring materials, then a classic @ORGANIZATION1 movie would be considered violent. The adult movies are worse in every way. They involve cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content. I'm not going into any further detail about adult movies. Being an adult, one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judgment of what they are going to let their children watch.  Different people like different content and it is only fair for them to be the ones to decide what they watch and consider violent. For example, one person might grow up around a farm and be used to seeing animals killed, while one who grew up in a neighborhood has never seen an animal killed. When they both see the movie or read a book with an animal killed, it will have hardly an effect on the one from the farm compared to the likely painful effect on the one from a neighborhood. Think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book. A soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a manager of a company. As stated before, different people prefer different types of content.  All in all, I don't think there should be any censorship on library content. It should be up to the parents to make the choice of what they are going to let their children watch or read. Adults can also be the judge of what they let themselves watch. Lastly, again, different people like different content and it's not fair for one to choose what another can or can't watch.
994	3971	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I firmly believe that even if books, music, movies, or magazines on the bookshelves are offensive, they should still be left there. They are a part of our history and the history we're creating.  If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a high chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to access those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.  Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels calm and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.  From what I've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.  A lot of books and movies, even great ones, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.  Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them. By allowing these materials to remain, we preserve the diversity of thought and the freedom of access that libraries are meant to provide.
995	3972	2	3	Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies, and magazines. These books, movies, and magazines may come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take those offensive books off the shelf?  If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young children need books to help their imagination grow. If there were no more books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books, but for young children, it is easier to visualize a movie rather than a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf. One book or movie may seem offensive to you, but may not to another person.  A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world. I would rather have a few offensive books than none at all. That way, I can learn and see characters' adventures through my own eyes. In the end, the value of a diverse library collection far outweighs the potential discomfort of encountering offensive content, as it allows for the free exchange of ideas and the development of well - rounded individuals.
996	3973	2	3	Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you? If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying “I can't learn with this black girl in class with me”? Or if two people with different religions would say “he or she offends me because we don't believe in the same god.” Just because someone is offended by a book or writing does not mean it should be removed from the shelf. In fact, if they don't like it, they don't have to read or even look at it. That is one freedom we have in America, the freedom to read anything we would like to. For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom. In conclusion, it is not okay for anything to be taken off of a public shelf no matter who it offends. It is a right we have as Americans to read or write anything we would like to, and removing offensive material would be taking away our freedom.
997	3974	2	3	I do not think that censorship has a rightful place in our libraries. I know that libraries were created to be information hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they might be seen as offensive to a minority of people. Libraries are meant to offer a wide - range of knowledge and perspectives. Censoring materials would limit this access and go against the very purpose of a library. We should respect the diversity of ideas and let people make their own choices about what to read. In conclusion, censorship has no place in libraries as it undermines the core function of providing unrestricted access to information.
998	3975	2	3	I do believe that libraries should censor certain materials. Some things like music and magazines have bad language and racy pictures in them. Some parents might not want their kids to be exposed to this. They are concerned about their children's well - being and want them to be in a safe environment. Some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and want them to be safer. The easiest way to prevent children from listening to inappropriate music or looking at offensive books is to take them off the shelves. Some children go to the library without adult supervision and have the freedom to check out whatever book they want. The child could easily pick out an inappropriate book and read it because there is no parent there to guide them. There is nobody to tell them what is wrong and right so some kids might not know. That's why some books and music should be removed. If you do not remove inappropriate books and music from the shelves, you would have to have an attendant. The attendant would have to walk around and check out what each individual kid is doing. It would be a lot of busy work and the librarians are already busy enough. Nobody really wants to do that so the simpler solution is to just remove the books and music from the shelves. Another option if you do want to keep the music and books on the shelves is to have an age limit on the books and music to check them out. If this were done, it would still lead to problems like kids reading the books at the library but never checking them out. This is an easy way to get around the system. A child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them, so they could read it later. This is another example of how easy it would be to get around that system. Therefore, the easiest way to avoid problems with books and music is to remove them from the shelves. If this were done, it is harder for the children to get the inappropriate books and music. If somebody needed to check out an inappropriate book for any reason, they could go someplace else. This is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe.
999	3976	2	3	Censorship? Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it? Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the light of day. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries. Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. They want to present a perfect image and believe that everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it. I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is an article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it. If it has a good message to send, you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at it the next time you go by there. If you think that something is too bad for the eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you, that censorship in libraries limits the free flow of ideas and people should be able to make their own choices.
1000	3977	2	3	I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship. A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the Mark Twain books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it. Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has its own style and music, has its own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves. Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so children can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it. Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefore making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them. You can't please everyone, so just let us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin, but we should not let censorship win.
1001	3978	2	3	In the words of the author, Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' There are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another. If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted for by everyone, they are mistaken. Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they may not always be pleased with the outcome. Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncensored material can be found on every shelf. As during my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language. Shakespeare's play 'Othello' describes him in very crude ways. Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved. Othello was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis. Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name - calling is appropriate. Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom. Shakespeare also discusses a 'strumpet' in 'Othello'. Once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different. Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products. Magazines are a threshold of adult matters. Once a teenager or child views all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life. They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine. Who wouldn't want to be like a model? When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like goddesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards. After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications. A whole cycle of being under - appreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful. In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide. Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind. Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men. Are you going to control your life or let the media?
1002	3979	2	3	Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the school's library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some books, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored on a school campus are too many racial slurs, profanity, and inappropriate situations. How many schools have books that have racism in them? Racism happens in books all the time. In fact, one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is 'Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain. It recently got banned from schools all over the United States. People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools, it is up to the kids not to read them. Inappropriate situations are why schools only order some Sports Illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scenes in the books. Do you say to blame them? I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for the youth.
1003	3980	2	3	People out there have the right to decide whether or not their children's books have censorship in them. Some parents don't want their child to read books like that till they get older. Kids in grade school don't know the book they are getting has profanity in it. I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yeah, some parents don't care what their child reads. Think about the ones that do. Not everyone has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me, I would not put books with censorship in them in my child's school. Then again, the high - school students are old enough to look through the books and decide if they want to get that book or not. Yeah, some parents still care about their child when they get into high school, but high - school students are old enough to make their own decisions. Some students may not realize what book they grabbed until they start reading, but that's when they turn around and exchange it. I think high - school students are smart enough to choose their own books. This is why I think about the books and magazines etc. with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools. If you agree, you can do something about it. Talk to your child's school.
1004	3981	2	3	Remain on the Shelf? Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contain offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive; the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. This could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that don't consider them to be offensive. What is offensive to one person, may not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music, the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from a song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to every day. These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certain magazine may not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves, there would most likely be nothing left. Removing them could cause chaos to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certain materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesn't offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge. Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience, teenagers are interested in a lot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain a lot of physical and sexual content along with a decent amount of foul language. An older person would not be interested in the foul language and content. They would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more because they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing a lot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest. Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor may not offend me. Chances are that there will always be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it, the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They may still be offended on the inside but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing.
1005	3982	2	3	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go. Some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in libraries, or some may not think it's so important. Books are important parts of people's lives, learning, etc. They are also read for many different reasons, but some of the topics books are written about may not be right or could be inappropriate or possibly against all of someone's beliefs or religion. I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of libraries. Just some things shouldn't be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library. Maybe materials that are inappropriate for children or people may find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials. Another reason why censorship may not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that may be offensive or inappropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on TV or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. TV has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that a TV show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of today's young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. Today's children and young people should be taught of what's wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unnecessary at the time. When they mature they hopefully will see why they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on TV and not get involved with these activities. Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the inappropriate and harmful things in today's culture. Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music. If they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things, they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with what's right. In conclusion, censorship is not necessary. It could be in the future, but if everyone is led to what is right, they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.
1006	3983	2	3	You Are @CAPS1 You @CAPS2? Censorship is indeed a touchy subject in our modern - day society. People frequently ask, '@CAPS3 much should be censored?' or even 'Should @CAPS9 be censored at all?' My opinion is that censorship should rightfully be left up to the parents of the children who are reading, listening to, or watching various materials. Television networks and reading companies, including publishers and libraries, simply can't possibly take the place of a parent. I firmly believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care about what the child is reading, the distributors of the materials can't be punished.  In my experience, my mother has actively taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age. She is always keenly interested in what I am reading. Occasionally, she will carefully glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to read. My mother has also censored my music by thoroughly glancing through my music player and every so often, playing a song or two. She discourages me from listening to anything that my mother wouldn't approve of. I have also experienced censorship in my local library. The library is neatly divided into sections, beginning with the children's books. These books are specifically appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material. This section then leads to young adult, and eventually the adult books. The music is also similarly divided into these categories. I believe this is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to.  Through reading the book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' by @PERSON1, I have clearly observed that parents need to have some involvement in what their children are reading, listening to, and watching. In that book, @PERSON2's parents simply left him alone while he was in his room. They let him listen to his own music, and watch whatever he wanted. This led him to listening to a @CAPS7 metal band called '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.' This band influenced him to commit a homicide in his school, killing ten students. This is a worst - case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all. Violence can have a large impact on young kids; therefore, they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature.  Through my reading, I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population. The novel '@CAPS10 @NUM1' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme. Reading is banned in their society, except for comic books and sex magazines. This shows that without a right to read, society is reduced to very simple, uneducated creatures. Censoring an entire people's reading is impractical. My opinion is that once a person is an adult, they have the common sense and maturity to read whatever they choose.  Censorship is difficult to take a stand on because there are so many positives and negatives to consider. My position on this vital subject is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading, not the government or the reading companies. Once a person is an adult, their right is to choose whatever they like to read. Reading is a magical thing that should not be held back from adults who are prepared to experience it to its fullest. As long as society keeps a balance between the outcome of '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' in which censorship was not practiced, and '@CAPS10 @NUM1' in which it was enforced to the fullest, I believe that we have reached an appropriate balance. Censorship is healthy for children, but restricting for adults.
1007	3984	2	3	Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certain types of books away from people. But how does that really help? Even if you remove certain books or music from a library, it doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides, many of the things that people want to censor are probably not that bad. I think it is better for someone to read about something rather than have it happen to them and then experience it. Like Katherine Paterson said, if we let people get rid of books or music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to, what will we have left? Nothing! Through people think censoring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad sides to have much of a good effect.  When people try to censor things, they normally just take things off of shelves and get rid of them. But, in today's world of advanced technology, that doesn't stop people from obtaining their goal. We have the internet that allows people to easily upload books and music to share. So yeah, you may not be able to get a book at the library, but you can almost always find it online. As a result, trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really isn't doing anything.  How do you determine what should be censored? People all have a different idea of what is okay for the public and what is not. Some books that get removed could insult a group of people because it is related in some way to them. Then you lose business and make people mad at the same time. In some way, isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt? When things like that happen in a book, they normally don't just stop there. They show the results or how the situation was handled. Which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situations later on in their life. Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't.  Katherrine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is immoral, nothing will be left. Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something in every book that they could find bad. Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way. No books would be left if we censored libraries because people could find things bad or immoral in every book.  Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more trouble than it's worth. It is not stopping people from obtaining the information another way. There is no way to decide what should be censored. And, censoring some things will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing. In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end.
1008	3985	2	3	Dear Newspaper staff, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1. I am writing to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. I am in the @NUM1 grade. The reason for this letter is that I believe that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. The reason why I think it should be done is because kids these days have their minds all over the place, from porn to games to bad music etc.  In many books, magazines, and movies, there are things in them that shouldn't be there. When kids get hold of it, they act like they've never seen anything like it. When they get on the computer, they get on websites that they know they are not supposed to be on. If we didn't have these things, we wouldn't have to worry about the loud music, the viruses on the computer, and the books being ripped up. But these days, there are so many things people can do to get all of these things.  If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves, that would be so wonderful for everyone. If they leave all the materials out there, it's going to cause more and more problems. When they just take it off, everything will be in great shape. In conclusion, taking offensive materials off the shelves is a necessary step to protect the well - being of kids and maintain a healthy environment.
1009	3986	2	3	What is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world? There are so many diverse types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a cherished hobby. Books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new and immersive world for readers. The latest and juiciest gossip can be found in many magazines. Music is sometimes said to be a powerful tool to help people cope with life problems. Movies can open up people's imaginations and make them feel a wide range of emotions for a theme that may seem of no great importance at first. All these things make up people's lives. Without any of these enjoyments, what would people do with their free time? Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off shelves. They're huge factors that make up the society and make life what it is.  Books and magazines are two delightful things people love to read. Fiction or non - fiction? No matter if books are real or based on imagination, they create stories that deeply interest people. Reading is a hobby that's been around since the very beginning of times. There are numerous different selections in reading, for example, exciting adventure, thrilling mystery, hilarious comedy, or heart - warming love stories. People will always read no matter what. Most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome, but those are the stories that have a magnetic pull on people. Magazines are often casually picked up when going into the checkout line in a grocery store. People love to read gossip, and learn about the latest and trendy fashion trends. Magazines provide a unique type of self - enjoyment for people. When reading a juicy title, most people can't help themselves but to pick up the magazine and learn what's going on in someone else's life.  Music is used for so many different and important purposes. It's often listened to when driving down the road, creating a pleasant atmosphere. Many people fall asleep to the soothing sounds of instruments that make a beautiful and relaxing melody. Lyrics in songs often relate to common people and at times it can be a great help to a person going through a rough challenge. There is something truly special about the different beats songs make that can completely change people's moods. On most @DATE1 nights, it is always a common sight that movie theatres are very crowded. Movies bring out imagination and tell stories where people can watch and follow along with great interest. When watching a movie with a sad ending, most people can't help but cry. Although not always real, it touches people on a deep emotional level. Movies can bring things to life in a vivid way.  Life is what it is because of these contributing factors. All people think differently and like different things. Books, magazines, music, and movies all relate to people's likes and dislikes. Taking things off the shelves because they are offensive or don't always make people feel good won't make our world any better of a place. If anything, it will take away the happiness in the world. These things make people feel different in ways that can't be easily described. Most often, things that are offensive are actually the truth. Why hide things that are real? What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't do something just because it could offend a couple of people out of millions? All these things are a source of comfort for some people.  Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and everyday life what it is. They are simple things in life, but once gone, they leave a huge gap. Things are fun and creative because of books, magazines, music, and movies. In my own experience, books make me interested in various subjects, magazines fulfill my desire for reading about celebrities, music makes me feel happy when I am sad, and movies make me feel like I can feel the same emotions as the characters do. They should not be taken off shelves just because they are offensive; they are an integral part of life.
1010	3987	2	3	In this essay I am going to write about the books in the libraries. Also, whether there are books that can be offensive and if they can or cannot be removed by the libraries. I think that the libraries have the right to have any materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more on the shelves. Well, in my opinion, I think that they should not remove any books because some people might think that it can be offensive, but other people might be really into those books. So no, I don't think they should remove any because people have different opinions on different books.  When I go to libraries, there are books that I can enjoy reading or not like, but that is just my personal opinion. Some people might like the book that I did not like or even hate. I think that the books should not be removed from the shelves because some people might enjoy them and some won't. I think they should not remove books because the books are for people who are interested in the books that they want to read or learn about the stuff about the past or just enjoy fictional books.  In conclusion, the diversity of books in libraries caters to different people's interests and needs. Removing books based on a few people's opinions of offensiveness would limit the freedom of choice and the educational and entertainment value that libraries provide. Therefore, libraries should keep all types of books on their shelves to serve the wide - ranging interests of the public.
1011	3988	2	3	Books are an extremely important part of literature, serving as vessels of knowledge, imagination, and diverse perspectives. Many different people have varying views of different kinds of books, shaped by their unique backgrounds, experiences, and values. Some people whole - heartedly enjoy books, finding solace, entertainment, and enlightenment within their pages, while some people don't, perhaps due to lack of time, interest, or other reasons. Some people are fast readers, quickly devouring the text to grasp the essence, and some people aren't, preferring to savor each word. Reading is an individual task. Your reading abilities, interests, and preferences are different from everyone else's. The main idea here is preferences. You may enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else may find offensive. But just because someone else doesn't enjoy it, does that mean that you shouldn't be able to enjoy it for yourself? Just because it is in the library, doesn't mean you have to check it out. Just because it is the new release in the book store and everyone loves it, doesn't mean YOU have to buy it. Other people can avoid the topics that they don't like. For example, if the local library took out all of the books that had anything to do with drugs and alcohol, because they found them offensive, the fact that they took the books out, could be offensive to the other people who enjoyed them. Also, some things could be offensive to some people that could be critical to research for others. Then, some people may not have the resources available that they need. If it is music, movies, or magazines, then it should be dealt with the same way. People have a choice of what they want to buy and rent. If a certain artist or actor is offensive to them, they should find something else and leave that album or movie for someone else to enjoy. They shouldn't complain about it. How would they feel if someone found their favorite band's music offensive and then no one could rent it from the library or buy it anywhere? Then, people would understand that everyone is different in their own way and not everyone will enjoy what they do. I think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that, everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels. Every book, movie, album, magazine, and any other thing, should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too.
1012	3989	2	3	"People of the world often always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case, I think that if it is in a public library, they do need to carefully watch what they put on the shelves. If some little kid grabs a Playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued. Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school - work they have. Books about anatomy are an exception, but if that library has a book like ""Sex for Dummies"", then something needs to be done in that facility. Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material, they need to go elsewhere to find it. Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future generations. If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it. What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are. People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad that says ""Buy Now"", ""Get Rich"", or ""All - Inclusive Deals"", these are found in a lot of magazines like ""Cosmopolitan"" and sometimes ""GQ"". These ads are totally uncalled for. If people looked into this more than they do, we wouldn't have to fight this as much. These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians. These types of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that Americans and non - Americans find so offensive. So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences. By being more vigilant, libraries can better protect the young and maintain their role as a reliable source of knowledge."
1013	3990	2	3	"Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view? For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated ""R"". I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies, but for libraries it should be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages. Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a CD has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a CD can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to. Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, I don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you. With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech. In conclusion, while age - appropriate restrictions are reasonable, overall, libraries should uphold the principles of free access and free expression."
1014	3991	2	3	Magazines and Books I am writing an essay on should we take books, magazines, or movies off the shelves if they have bad language or have violent roles in it. First thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. For me personally, I like books that have violence and graphic language in them because that just makes the book so much more interesting. And when it comes to music, their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to. And TV broadcasters need to watch what they put on the air because some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch. The second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books. I don't think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violence or hearing words that are graphic. But it's not up to me; they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it. Because it is up to them if they want their kid listening to or reading material like that. And it's also up to the children's parents what kind of music they listen to. Because there is more coarse words in the music than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazines. Magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to pictures. Me myself don't really look at magazines because they don't really interest me. I would rather sit down and watch whatever it is on TV. Then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in America more censored for kids. I think the libraries should have different rooms that have different types of books in them. Because if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted, then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading. They should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphic pictures or that just are not suitable for children. That is why I think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands. Kids don't need to know bad language at their age because that is a bad habit for a kid to learn, then they will go to school saying them. And reading books that talk about beating somebody up or murder might get it in a little kid's head that that is ok. And that is not ok with me. In the end, proper control of access to such materials in libraries is crucial for the healthy development of children.
1015	3992	2	3	Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, etc. All of these are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be censored? If books or music have these types of messages in them, it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes, books and music should be censored. My first supporting reason of why books and music should be censored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering someone, or selling drugs, nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncensored books and songs, it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer pressure. The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music offends people by their race, religion, or their appearance. You find most of the criticism from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to do drugs, etc. Books and music that have advertisement about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or read a book without getting disrespected and offended. My final reasoning for books and music being censored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, rap music and heavy metal tend to have a lot of bad - messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all rappers and heavy - metal bands are bad. If songs and books were censored, there wouldn't be a stereotype against a certain type of music, and books could have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material. Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are censored, there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes, I feel books and music should be censored. By censoring, we can create a more positive and respectful cultural environment.
1016	3993	2	3	I do not think they should be removed at all. They show a person's opinion on something. We can't just disregard it because we don't like what it's saying. That's like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how they look. Or just anyone that we don't like how they look. It's simply unfair to dismiss others' views based on our personal dislikes. I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship. I may not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would. You should restrict access according to age based on the content so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be. I could get a book removed because it offends me. Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me. People are offended by little things and should just accept the fact that other people have different opinions. It's just like judging a person for their race. They have different morals and values and you can't just change that in a person. Like if you don't like this article just don't read it. Don't say other people can't read it because of your views. I don't think there should be censorship as it goes against the principle of free expression and the diversity of thought.
1017	3994	2	3	There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while others believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and it's free will that allows people to pick up these books. No one is forcing them to read them. I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion. I feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrongdoings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. Some politicians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter. Another example would be a book on religious purposes. For instance, a book on an alternative religion. Some believers might take it as offensive if the information paints them as being a certain stereotype, but others may see it as educational learning. I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who might be coming to rent the book that day. It's up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter. I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes. I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive. I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information. Some of the material found might be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'. I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today. The library is a place where our free will comes into play. I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries. These books all contain information that could be viewed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decipher for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable. I believe that no one should decide for us as it undermines the essence of a free - thinking society.
1018	3995	2	3	Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive. This way, we can respect different viewpoints while also making the content more palatable. First, no one should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to entertain ourselves. Also, it would start a big fight because a lot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people don't find offensive, a big riot will start. It would lead to chaos and a suppression of diverse ideas. Secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? Maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if they could make it milder or less vulgar. Same with music, movies, and magazines. This approach allows for a balance between freedom of expression and social sensibilities. So, in conclusion, everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if I came across something that offended me I wouldn't do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do. We should embrace the diversity of expression in a civilized way.
1019	3996	2	3	Empty spaces in our understanding of censorship need to be filled. Is it wrong to censor? In the world today, there are about 7 billion people. All these people make up different groups with different moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and outlooks on the world. With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is wrong and right. The three subjects that will be discussed in this article will be censorship, expression, and society. To be censored puts a label on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, whether it would be of sex, drugs, or politics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, television, or other forms of media. The reasons that something is censored change from place to place. Different cultures and communities have their own standards. Expression of one's inner thoughts of the world or a general area could be disastrous in the eyes of some. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next Leonardo da Vinci, Einstein, or any other great thinker of the world. Censoring these people can and would be horrible. The idea that just because someone has a different outlook does not mean they are the evil that is in the world. True, their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shunned by the world. The material they produce should be allowed to be seen by anyone of any age. It is through diverse expressions that we can grow intellectually. Society possesses a big problem. Society or how one should act in public is different all over the world. So therefore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else. This also means what is wrong or right is different to everyone on earth. The society will have a great effect on what is allowed to be seen or heard by those that live in the society. If the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned. If this is let to continue nothing will be allowed to speak its mind on anything. It will lead to a stagnant and homogeneous world. So, is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others. If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that person's views. So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for their ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct. Everything should be allowed to exist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter. In conclusion, censorship restricts the free flow of ideas and stifles creativity and progress.
1020	3997	2	3	If content in a library is considered offensive, it should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but a select few will still value the media for what it is. Taking one kid's cake because it has too much frosting would anger most kids (and adults). It's an unfair act that curtails the rights of those who might benefit from the content. If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material it should remain organized with the rest of its kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropriate and/or offensive content. This way, we can ensure that people are aware of what they are getting into. I personally find certain types of poetry or, in the context of a song, certain lyrics fascinating. Every time I look up these poems I have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with its violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree it should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read (or listen) without their consent. I believe that simply asking the customer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to. By respecting people's choices and providing them with information, we can strike a balance between access to diverse content and protecting individuals from unwanted exposure.
1021	3998	2	3	Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. These materials might contain language that is harsh, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion, I firmly believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose. These books or movies are put out there either for entertainment or learning purposes. Some historical events, such as the @LOCATION1, are things that many people would like to forget. But no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not repeat such mistakes. Language is a big part of today's world, and many do not appreciate a bad word. Filmmakers put these words in movies to emphasize something significant because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies, a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them, but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count, but the story line is phenomenal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing; it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time. As for books in libraries, we should make a separate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not stumble across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a special sticker on the book to warn parents as well. In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just maybe moved to a different location. Let the people read what they want to read.
1022	3999	2	3	As far as opinions go, everyone has one. However, only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an argument for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in one's opinion should not be omitted. At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If they are interested in something, they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc. are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed. Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of @NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit - and - chat session for better understanding. Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the child's curiosity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplest solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated. Therefore, if one person out of millions dislikes a book because they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who tries to keep themselves away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read. To agree to removing information from the library is absolutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By removing every source, all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and becomes someone they never wanted them to be.
1023	4000	2	3	Libraries have so many books, and these books cover a wide range of topics, talking about everything under the sun. So what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves? If people want to read something that is considered 'bad', I say let them. What is so wrong with reading? Everyone needs to read, and maybe those are the only books some people like to read. So by taking those books off isn't helping anything. I think some of the so - called 'bad' books taken off the shelves are actually good, they just have some bad things in them. In my view, any book is a good book. If something is so bad it needs off the shelves, there has to be a reason for it. The way I see it is that there has to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad, and you know what? That is funny. People get mad at books that they don't want their kids to read, or they're mad because they didn't come up with that idea. If you don't want your kids to read it, tell them not to. Let the older people who don't care have a good time reading. Most people like to read about messed - up things. Music and Movies are a different story. Bad movies shouldn't be put out for everyone to see. Movies aren't the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not know half of the bad stuff means. But movies show you how bad things are. Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make them look cool. But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick. And if you have kids, you are the boss to them. You can tell them not to get anything bad.
1024	4001	2	3	"In all libraries, you are offered a choice on which book you would like to choose. So if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want a book with censorship, then you can. The libraries should not take away books because of the content. In my honest opinion, it should be the readers' choice and not someone else's. When choosing a book, you have to think, ""Do I really want to read this?"" Each book gives you a little description on the back of the book, giving you a little inside so you can tell if you would like to read the book or not. I do believe if it has suggested content, you should not let little kids read them. But at a high school level, we pretty much are able to make choices for ourselves. Music should not be censored because if a song says something that you don't want to hear, like cussing or suggestive content, then just turn the station. You don't have to sit and listen to the song. You can change it with a click or push of a button. Songs that are on the radio are for enjoyment and entertainment. So you made the choice to go to that station and listen to the music that is on it. You made the choice, and nobody can make it for you. With movies, they have a description on the back that tells what is going to be in the movie and what it's rated. If you don't want to watch a movie with bad language or bad content, you should not have chosen the movie in the first place. It is clear as day on the case what will be in it. On movie cases, it even gives you pictures of certain scenes, and if they seem a little suggestive, then put it back and select a different movie. Magazines are meant to tell the truth, and sometimes the truth is hard. Magazines are stocked on shelves in stores, and on the front, it will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself. If you are really bothered by certain language, thumb through the magazine and see if it is appropriate or not for you. Libraries should not have to get rid of books just because of some content. A person who walks through those doors should be aware of what is in the library and what exactly they will find. In libraries, they have categories in which certain topics are under. By going towards a selection, it is saying that you understand what type of book it will be."
1025	4002	2	3	Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different from what you or anyone else like. You @MONTH1 think some of the things are offensive, but yet again, something you don't like, someone else @MONTH1 like and want to read. Would it be fair to you that you like something and want to read it, but someone else does not like it and thinks that it offends them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said? I don't think that things like that should be taken off a shelf for such a reason. There could be a person in school that needs something that is not right for a child to be looking at. But what if there is a kid in high school or college that needs a book to do a project over that type of thing? Also, yes, I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at, listening to, or reading should not be able to be easily accessed. Parents should not have to worry about them going to a library, and their children seeing something that they do not want them to see. There are very many ways that people who work in the libraries can keep things away from children who are too little to see or hear what their parents do not want them to. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that are like that in a section of the library that you have to be a certain age to be able to go look or listen to them. Libraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or how you dress. You as a person have the right to go into a public library and look for something to read, no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds of books, you should be mature for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today, so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it because you see it just about everywhere you go nowadays. You really can't get away without dealing with it. In conclusion, libraries should keep a wide range of materials while taking measures to protect younger patrons, ensuring that everyone's right to access information is respected.
1026	4003	2	3	First, libraries are indeed a valuable and good source of information. However, at the same time, a library can have both pros and cons regarding its information. There is some information that should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what would happen if a child got their hands on an adult - themed book? What's one practical way we can prevent this?   Next, you can find a wealth of information about everyday life in libraries. Through magazines, movies, music, and books, you can discover all sorts of details. There is explicit music where the artist curses and says inappropriate things. From my past experiences, there have been books where an author just talked about her sex life. I also have a past experience with magazines, such as '@CAPS1'. All these items have to either stay out of libraries or be put in a section where children can't reach them.   Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyway. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary in a library setting. They could simply get rid of the music. Also, children shouldn't get their hands on certain books, but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventually. The committee should organize a contest in which people of any age in the community could write an essay expressing their opinion.   Finally, I've come up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how some people make a living, and some people actually like these things. So, they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 or older to enter and need an identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way, we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to enter this section.   In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So, they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines, and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way, they won't need censorship.
1027	4004	2	3	I feel that you have the right to choose to remove certain books, movies, music, and magazines, but only if they are not appropriate for some people, especially children. Some people like these items, while others do not. It all depends on who you are.   If I go to a library and the books I want are on the restricted list, the library should charge a small fee, somewhere around @MONEY1 to @MONEY2, depending on the type of book. For instance, if I wanted the movie @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1 and it was restricted, I would pay something like a Redbox rental fee.   That is what I think about restricting certain items from the library. It's a way to balance the rights of different patrons and still maintain access to a wide range of materials.
1028	4005	2	3	People who walk the surface of our planet sometimes feel the need to have something banned or at least get some dirt on it to make people think less of it. It is just the way our world works when it comes to something you just can't stand. But why even bother? Just what exactly are they going to gain from it? If someone took the time and effort to create it, then we all deserve the right to view it. I firmly do not agree with censorship in our world.   Local libraries are a very nice and inviting place to go for books, movies, and information. How can this be such a good resource for people once everything controversial is gone? Especially considering some of the world's greatest books ever written are the ones that are targeted by censorship. I believe Katherine Paterson has a very valuable and thought - provoking point in saying, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' because it is absolutely true. People don't stop at just one item. Once something is gone, they will continue hunting for things that they just dislike, which will lead to people suffering from not being able to enjoy the things they want.   When I was younger, I remember going to the library all the time for @CAPS1 movies and books. I personally got to actually see a book be removed because of censorship. Although I did not fully understand it at that time, I felt that if I read it, I would get grounded. This is also not good for kids because they shouldn't be scared to read something. We live in a place with the freedom of speech, but yet that right seems to be gradually fading away. There are still more ways to see censorship and how it affects the libraries, such as actually reading about some of the cases that have tried to ban books.   Although most attempts to ban books fail right now, the world is very unpredictable. In school, there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned. It is quite funny how those books are the only ones that were fun to read during the school year. So, it doesn't make sense to take them off the shelves. Reading is what keeps us informed, about the past and even the future.   'Then we have no books left.' If this is what people wish for, then keep at it. But if there is some sort of decency in you, I would imagine when it comes to making an easy choice like this, you too would choose the right one: saying no to censorship. Reading is what keeps us strong, entertained, and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it, unless books are gone. In a world without books, we lose a vital part of our cultural and intellectual heritage.
1029	4006	2	3	Many individuals visit different libraries all over the world every single day. Some go for books, some for magazines, and some for movies. Everyone has different tastes, so a library is the perfect place they go because it has absolutely everything one could desire.   Libraries have all kinds of amazing and diverse books. It is a place where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research. There should be no limits on what books, movies, magazines, etc., are on the shelf. Everyone has different beliefs and feelings on what they would like to read or see.   If libraries start limiting their options, I don't think that they would have as much business, and people would not read as much. Which means that an individual's @CAPS1 could decline. Reading helps everyone in this world, by learning new vocabulary and simply exercising their eyes. By taking away someone's interest, they won't read as much or feel as free.   Just because someone doesn't like something, it does not mean the next person won't. If a book or movie, etc., is offensive to someone, they can just simply not read it or watch it. No one has the right to take over someone's mind regarding what they are interested in.   However, limiting the age groups for certain items would not be a horrible idea. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive or not appropriate for a young child should not be allowed to be seen or checked out by a young child, but that does not mean taking it away from others. In this way, libraries can respect the diverse needs and rights of all their patrons.
1030	4007	2	3	Books nowadays have action, romances, and so on. That's why the books that are not moving off the shelf are because they don't have what other popular books have. So, they just sit there, while most of the other books that are flying off the shelf are the happy @CAPS1, The @CAPS2 side, The @CAPS3, and all of the vampire books. It's because they have action, love, and all the elements that readers crave.   The books that are on and off the shelf may be really good books. Some books never leave the shelf, probably because they are not that great. The reason for it is that the books on the shelf might be boring or old - school books. They really don't have what the reader is looking for. However, the books that are really making readers happy are the ones that are based on movies, like the @CAPS2 side. That book has gotten sold faster than the movies themselves.   The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is that for books based on movies, like the @CAPS2 side, the author gives more information about the movie. I heard that that book is nothing like the movie; the book is so much better because it provides more in - depth details about the movie. Therefore, people really like books that are adapted from movies.   There are more reasons why people like books nowadays. You don't have to go to a book store anymore. The books are now available on your iPhone, iPod, iTouch, iPad, and a Nook, etc. So, now you don't have to go to a book store. You can get them on the go. People are really happy that they don't have to get up in the morning or at any time to get their books. They can now just access them while they are on the move.   So, that is why books are now staying on the shelves for a long time. Because you can get them on the go. But I believe that people who love the feel of a physical book should try and just go out and get an iPhone or a Nook, something that saves you time while you are on your way to work or school. This way, they can still enjoy reading without the hassle of visiting a bookstore.
1031	4008	2	3	First, I do not think the libraries should take all of those things because some of those items are necessary for people to assist them with their work. For instance, when some people need music to facilitate their thinking, and perhaps some people need magazines for reference. So, I firmly believe that the libraries should not remove the items from the shelves as it would limit the resources available to users.
1032	4009	2	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. The short video is about my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 watching the movie anthology horror of @CAPS7 with @PERSON1. I admit I was extremely scared out of my mind initially, but then I managed to get over it. As time passed and after watching it a few times, I gradually got used to it. That's it for this @CAPS6 assignment, which has provided an interesting experience related to this horror movie.
1033	4010	2	3	The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker. It serves as a repository where one can explore a vast array of knowledge. The library holds books of past and current writers, which offer diverse perspectives and insights. It also holds information on past and current events, enabling people to understand the development of the world. Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history. One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information. Periods like the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million @CAPS1 by @LOCATION2, would eventually fade away with the generations that knew about it. The Holocaust was an event that became widely known @CAPS2 - wide during @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, which was a major historical event. The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship. The slave trade is a major part in @CAPS5 history that helped shape the country into what it is today. Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance. If we censor certain materials, we begin to forget key parts of history. Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn. Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed.  Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books. One reason is because authors wrote their books as they intended them to be read. An example is @PERSON2, the author of The @CAPS6 of @PERSON3 and The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION2. Both books use the word @NUM1r to convey the tone. Another example is the author of To @CAPS7 A @CAPS8, @PERSON1. Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an author's writing style. The author writes a book as they want it to be read. Therefore, they use the language and words of the time - period they write about. @PERSON2 didn't use @NUM1r because he was racist; he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked. Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.  Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles. One reason is because newspapers were the way to send out information. They brought people's attention to recent happenings and informed people of what was going on. Getting rid of that is just another loss of information. Newspapers were key players in getting out information about @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the assassination of @CAPS12, and @ORGANIZATION1. Another reason to keep from censoring newspapers in libraries is because of their importance today. They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events. An example is the death of @LOCATION1 and how he caused the deaths of many @CAPS13 on @DATE1 eleventh, and articles about views on the death penalty. Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles.  The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker. There, they can read about past and current events. They can also read classics by great authors. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles, as it would undermine the library's role in providing comprehensive knowledge.
1034	4011	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,  Around the world, there are people who censor what their people read and write. These works are oftenly produced by communist and socialist governments. Here in @LOCATION1, we have the right to say, read, and write what we want, about anybody or anything. Censorship does exist in the @LOCATION1, and it exists in the form of an opinion.  I have read articles in the paper about how textbooks have covered up the truth due to what is politically correct. I have heard of libraries taking down books that have a very strong political opinion. Often, these are books written by conservatives. I have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming probable presidential nominees. Being a conservative myself, I do not believe that these books should be excluded from bookstores, libraries, or other public venues.  I believe this because in @LOCATION1, we have freedom of the press, and for these books not to reach the public is against that right and the free - flow of ideas. You @MONTH1 may ask why I believe this. I believe this because I too want others to hear and read about my ideas on how to obtain life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Now that @PERSON1, is why all books should be in our libraries. I agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored so that little children will not get a hold of them. I would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts. We, the @ORGANIZATION1, are a republic, and we for over @NUM2 years have encouraged the free - flow of ideas. Why stop now? Thank you @PERSON2 for considering these important points about freedom of expression in our society.
1035	4012	2	3	My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.  Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person. If they are not a significant problem, they shouldn't be removed.  People might change their mind about going to that particular library if they find a large number of offensive things there. Also, having these offensive things in libraries increases the chance that they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act or think. A few things that I would find bothersome are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.  From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can affect the way you live if you take them seriously. Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos. I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it. In my opinion, I think libraries should take the time and carefully look through the books they have and decide whether or not they are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.  I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things from all libraries. Also, I believe if parents could choose, they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials. By doing so, libraries can create a more suitable environment for all users, especially for children's healthy development.
1036	4013	2	3	I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries are frequented by families and young children, who do not need to see, hear, or read certain inappropriate things. If people would like to buy inappropriate reading material, movies, or music, they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries, while other things are not. For instance, certain material such as rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults, but they do not have extremely racy pictures on their covers. However, other material is not something that most people are interested in having to see, and our young children should not be subjected to it. People who wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or should not even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. They will look for another place to get these items besides a public place filled with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like, but they should be censored in a public library. Most people don't read inappropriate material in public, and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres, so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Moreover, many people do not even want others to know that they are viewing these objects, so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library. I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things, but parents should not have to deal with their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far too young to understand. The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new and inappropriate things at younger and younger ages, whether it be drugs or inappropriate magazines. So, I believe that we should not start subjecting our children to such things at an even younger age than they will already find out about them. In conclusion, censorship in public libraries is necessary to protect the well - being of children and to respect the comfort of all library visitors.
1037	4014	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1, the author Katherine Paterson, said this. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive, then it should be placed in a special aisle. First off, if there are items that people find offensive, they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that are only suitable for adults, so there should be an aisle dedicated to offensive or inappropriate things. For someone to access that aisle, they should have permission and show an I.D. This way, kids and children won't accidentally slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, it might influence them to do bad things as they don't know any better. Secondly, if an individual finds a book or magazine offensive, they can avoid it by simply walking away. They don't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something, all they have to do is go complain to the person in charge of the library, and it can be removed if there are enough complaints. However, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see. Thirdly, children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting and want to pick it up and read it, which is bad as it might give them wrong ideas. Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something offensive or stay away from that area of the library. There will always be things that people find offensive and inappropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're really concerned about it, you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inappropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea as little kids won't be able to access it easily. In conclusion, keeping offensive materials in a separate aisle with proper access control is a practical solution that respects different views while protecting children.
1038	4015	2	3	Books on shelves are there for a reason. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote this. The quote, in short, means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children. Libraries have non - fiction and fiction books, as well as magazines, music, and movies. I myself like to learn a little bit of everything, but of course, there are things that I don't like learning when I'm too young. I enjoy discovering things on my own. There are times when I like discovering new things because I don't know when life ends. In other words, I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world. Magazines often have a lot of drama, and sometimes, while it's part of life, it's just about dramatic things related to people. A library is a great place to learn a lot of things. You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people, music, etc. Honestly, the only thing I go there for is to read and check out books, but from books, I have learned a great deal. There is some material that shouldn't be read and discovered when you're too young. There's material that is too intense for some children, and they should learn it gradually as they grow, not all at once. Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have warning signs indicating the appropriate age. There are times when it's good to learn about life, but you have to be careful because it @MONTH1 be too intense. There are books that teach you a lot. I have learned a lot from old books to new books. I don't think that the books should be removed. Yes, they @MONTH1 be strong, but it's our own choice to read them or not. There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason, and it's not to make fun of people. Magazines can also be good as they teach useful things and keep you updated about what's going on around the world. However, there are also some magazines that just talk about drama and criticize famous people. I don't think it's important to expose other people's personal lives or criticize them. That is definitely not good for children to learn at that age. Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone has the decision of what to read and what to look at. At the library, there is mostly music from centuries ago, and there were great composers. No, the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music. There's also new music, and everyone should choose what they want to listen to. Movies are a big part of life. There are a lot of things to learn from them, from slavery to the future. Everyone should have the choice to watch a movie without others dictating. In conclusion, while some library materials may be intense, they should remain available as it's up to individuals to decide what to engage with, and they offer valuable learning opportunities.
1039	4016	2	3	As a fellow person of the community and a person who often visits the library, I think that books, magazines, movies, etc., should not be taken off the shelf. The reason is that although something @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, it doesn't mean it's offensive to another. Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many people's knowledge of our world. This, in turn, can make the world more illiterate. Libraries provide multiple things that may not be at a family - friendly discretion level, but they can offer a lot of knowledge to the right age group. Movies are a large part of this issue. They are in the library for entertainment reasons. Removing these things @MONTH1 become harmful to a new generation in the long run. I personally, as a person who attends the library often, think that things being taken away cause unrest in different ways. I have read multiple books from all different sections of the library. Some even pertain to racism of my own ethnicity and use words that I don't like. I tolerate these words because I want to know what my ancestry had to do for me to get where I am today. Magazines are also a small part of this conflict. Like movies, they are there to provide entertainment. Most people use the library as a place to relax. The library is not just for borrowing books and other things; it's also a comfortable place for people to learn. In conclusion, as a fellow community member and a frequent library attendee, I think that things should not be taken off the shelves. Libraries provide various things that may not be suitable for family viewing but @MONTH1 provide help to other people. Some books deal with racism related to ethnicity, and they are not meant to be harmful but to show what our ancestors endured. Magazines are for entertainment, and if someone thinks they're inappropriate, they don't have to read them. Overall, the library's diverse collection should be maintained for the benefit of all.
1040	4017	2	3	There are two things that I would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf. First, there will always be something offensive to someone, no matter what it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be. Second, no matter what you do or try to do, there will always be something that a child will do or see that you @MONTH1 not want them to see or do. If people could remove things that they find offensive, then there wouldn't be anything on shelves, in stores, or really anywhere. There are too many different kinds of people who @MONTH1 dislike too many different things compared to others. If a person were to remove a book, and another person wanted to get that book but found it had been removed at someone else's request, that person wouldn't be happy and might stop coming back to that library. One person's decision to remove something they find offensive could ruin the experience for others. So, what if a book found offensive was removed? There are much worse things on television. Cartoons are often more violent than most books. More and more commercials and other types of advertising are using women, money, and fame to attract people. Most of the time, these are not meant for children. For example, a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product or some kind of adult - oriented entertainment is part of life. No matter what you @MONTH1 try to do to keep your child's environment 'safe', it just won't work these days. No matter how hard a person @MONTH1 try to change something they find offensive, there will be something just as bad around the next corner, whether it's a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band. Someone will always find something offensive and may teach their children to do the same. But just because someone @MONTH1 not like something doesn't mean their children or anyone else's children won't be interested. In conclusion, removing books from library shelves based on individual offense is not a practical solution as offensive elements are widespread in the real world, and everyone has different sensibilities.
1041	4018	2	3	Conflicting works of art, such as thought - provoking books, soul - stirring music, and captivating movies, have long been fixtures in libraries. Whether it's a controversial political book or a music album with radical lyrics, someone is bound to be offended. But the question of whether these potentially offending works should be banned is a hot - button topic among authors, musicians, and movie - goers. I firmly believe that all these works deserve to be seen, heard, or read, as the creator has poured their heart and soul into expressing their opinion and has the right to freedom of the press.  You could pick any well - known work, and there's a chance someone will be offended by it because it goes against their deeply held beliefs. However, this doesn't mean the work should be banned! Banning a book is a complete rejection of the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has the right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional as citizens of the United States have total freedom of the press. You simply can't impose censorship because, regardless of whether the work stays on the shelves, someone will be offended. Also, as Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 shows, the censorship of books could lead to a society that lacks a true understanding of the past and the feelings and thoughts of people from that era.  To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music aren't bad; they're catalysts for debate. They enable you, not just the author, to voice your feelings about what's presented in the works. But eliminating the opportunity for debate would be a disaster. Gloria Steinem once said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' By saying this, she's highlighting that if we all went into a library and removed the books, magazines, movies, or music we don't like, there'd be nothing left. Every work would be removed because at least one person is offended by each one. Therefore, allowing books to be read, music to be listened to, and movies to be watched is granting everyone the freedom to write down their thoughts or stances.  The censorship of any work, anywhere, is stifling ideas. These ideas are what drive society forward, making us think and helping us form our opinions. By allowing the free flow of these ideas, we're nurturing future generations of great thinkers. In this case, by keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and make use of the information and ideas that have shaped history.
1042	4019	2	3	The shelf is a useful object that holds a wide variety of different materials, including engaging movies, informative books, trendy magazines, and diverse music. It's all about media and entertainment. But not everyone is fond of the media because one or all of these materials might be offensive to foreigners and children.  Censorship in our libraries can get a bit extreme. Yes, we're used to seeing it in movies and music, but we don't expect it in libraries. A library is primarily a place for study and learning for educational purposes. It's not mainly for entertainment. Sometimes it can be a bit fun, but for the most part, people bring their children to libraries to expose them to things that help their minds focus on school. By all means, R - rated movies, dirty music, adult books, and magazines should be removed from the shelves.  One day, while I was in the state library looking for a book on Africa and its people. As I was reading the book, it made some very mean and offensive remarks about the African people. I was appalled and thought that this book should be taken off the shelves forever and never seen again. It was shocking that someone would place such a book in a public library and let foreigners and others read it. After some people read about the African people in that book, they had second thoughts and started getting angry and disliking them because of those offensive comments.  Magazines and movies about people in different countries and their ways of life should, in my opinion, be removed from the shelves. It could be very distressing for someone because they might have actually experienced everything described in the movie or magazine. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles of these materials. If a child sees an adult - themed film title that might seem suitable for a child, wouldn't you find that a bit offensive? I certainly would. There's no way I'd want my child watching a violent movie.  We must consider our children and people from different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship isn't carefully observed, we could anger foreigners or make our children become violent and reckless because of the inappropriate films on the shelves. And people from other countries might never return to our libraries if they pick up a book they thought was interesting but turns out to be offensive in their opinion. Censorship is very important in libraries and on the shelves to ensure a positive and appropriate environment for all.
1043	4020	2	3	I can think of a book that I sincerely hope none of our children or any other children take off the book shelf. I hope this because it would be offensive or demeaning to my race or the children's race. This book would probably prompt the children to ask questions that we'd rather not discuss.  This book would likely be one I wouldn't recommend for my children to read, not even to glance at the pages or the cover. I mean, if it weren't demeaning to anyone's race or skin color, I'd let my children read it. But if it contains profanity and racial slurs, I'd tell my kids that this book is off - limits until they're older.  Certain magazines, like those featuring swimsuit models and other inappropriate content, my children shouldn't be allowed to look at. Music is similar to magazines. If it has profanity and talks about drugs, I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music. If a movie has inappropriate content, my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated G or PG, then they are allowed to watch it. But if it is rated R or NC - 17, then my kids can forget about watching it.  So, in the end, yes, I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on because you never know what kind of influence it could have. And if you're a strict parent like I plan to be, don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that's just filling their minds with bad ideas.  I have to admit that I've watched, listened to, and looked at some inappropriate things in the past, and I regret it deeply. There are so many inappropriate books, movies, and magazines in today's libraries, which is a problem because little kids can easily get hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing. We need to be more vigilant to protect our children from such harmful materials.
1044	4021	2	3	If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed? In the following, I'll explain my opinion on censorship in libraries.  If some parents come across a book they find offensive and think their children shouldn't be able to access it from the library, they can simply forbid their children to read it. I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might believe other children shouldn't read it either. That's not their decision. Every parent has to decide for themselves whether they want their children to read certain books, and one parent shouldn't be able to make that decision for everyone else by removing a book.  Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, it doesn't mean that everyone else will be. Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed? It's their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it, they'd also prevent other people from reading it, and that's not fair. Different people have different tastes in books and are offended by different things. So, if everyone removed a book they didn't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left. I think if someone is offended by a book, they should just avoid reading it. They can tell their friends and family not to read it because they found it offensive, but in the end, everyone should make their own decision.  I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries. However, if the library itself deems a book offensive, then it shouldn't have it in its collection. It's their library, so it's their call what books they want to have there. I also think that when the library is selective about the books it acquires and doesn't have certain inappropriate books, that should satisfy other people.  So, all in all, I don't think people should be able to remove certain books because everyone has their own view on what's offensive and what isn't. We all should have the freedom to read or see what we want, not what others think we should. By respecting this freedom, we can maintain a diverse and inclusive library environment.
1045	4022	2	3	Everywhere I go, there always seems to be something, whether it's a small detail or a major issue, that can be considered offensive. Due to these offensive things, there is often censorship in public places. It's acceptable to view non - censored materials in the privacy of your own home and at your own discretion, but it's not very appropriate to do so in public. I believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences, the public nature of the materials, and the opinions of certain people.  Libraries are public places that attract a diverse audience. Whether it's curious children, inquisitive teens, busy adults, or wise elders, some things are inappropriate and shouldn't be accessible to certain people. This mainly applies to children. As the quote says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Why would anyone put these offensive books in libraries? Censorship will filter out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines to make these materials more suitable for all age groups.  Since libraries are public places, their materials are public property. Everyone has the right to access these materials. However, not every library will have the book, magazine, or movie you're looking for because it might contain profanity or inappropriate content. Some people might be against censorship in libraries, but there's often no censorship in bookstores, movie stores, music libraries, etc. If you want a certain non - censored material, go and buy it. That way, the material will be yours, and you can do with it as you please.  We live in a world where everyone can freely voice their opinions without fear of punishment. Libraries are meant for every age group, and censorship just ensures that everything is appropriate for everyone. Some parents don't allow their children to read certain books, watch certain movies, or listen to certain music because it's their opinion and their way of parenting. On the other hand, some parents do allow their children to engage with inappropriate materials, and that's their choice. However, libraries shouldn't introduce inappropriate things into the lives of children; that should be the decision of the parents or guardians.  In conclusion, censorship should be allowed in libraries because of the wide - range audience, public materials, and the strong opinions of the people. Everyone has the right to read, watch, and listen to what they choose, but not everyone should be exposed to inappropriate things in public places. We can't make everyone happy, but we can ensure that public places like libraries are appropriate for all.
1046	4023	2	3	In my experience, some music is just too offensive. They often use explicit words that should not be heard by certain individuals, especially those of certain ages. Even the magazines available have content that is way too inappropriate for some people. Some of the movies released these days are truly horrifying to watch. The fact that they place these things in a library shocks me greatly. One day, I was babysitting a little girl and I took her to the library. There was a CD on a shelf and she put it in her CD player. It was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it. I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age. As soon as I put my ear to her headphones, I immediately turned it off. They should really monitor the music they put out to the public because if I hadn't been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words. I don't think anyone would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really. It discriminates against women and gives young children ideas in their heads about sexual activities. One other thing they put out in libraries that I don't agree with is magazines that are a bit too mature. I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and I picked up a Cosmopolitan magazine. I was flipping through it and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself, 'What if a young child picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have. I've read somewhere that things children see at a young age have a great effect on who they will become. If this is true, I certainly think we should censor what we put out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library. We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have. We should also monitor the movies they watch and keep a close eye on the things they read. By being more vigilant, we can better protect the innocence and well - being of our children.
1047	4024	2	3	No, I don't think anything should be removed because not everyone wants to look at the same thing. I think if you don't like it, don't look at it. So, there is no need to remove it, no matter what. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, and what might be unappealing to one person could be interesting to another. For example, a particular book might seem boring to some but could be a source of great inspiration for others. Removing items based on individual dislikes would limit the variety and freedom of choice. In a diverse society, we should respect the fact that people have different views. Therefore, it's best to keep all options available and let individuals decide for themselves what they want to engage with.
1048	4025	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson's quote from her speech voices a strong point on citizenship. Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether it's a book, a magazine article, or even a TV show, things are censored. Censoring things doesn't make anything more enjoyable, but in fact makes less things enjoyable. I think that things that are offensive should not be removed from the shelf. Censorship disables the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things. I myself watch TV shows all of the time. When they censor things it makes me angry. I already know what the words are so why censor it. Mark Twain wrote a famous book called 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. And that book has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term. I have two things to say about it. One, if it offends you then you shouldn't watch or read it. Second, one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was the language used back then. So then one could take into thought when the book was written, what was the time of when the book had taken place, etc. There are two books that I read called 'Fahrenheit 451' and 'The Giver'. Both books have one thing in common. The use of censorship in their society. In 'Fahrenheit 451' books are censored. Guy Montag causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn't fair for books to be banned. Also in 'The Giver' a boy challenges his utopian society because they too censored certain things. Censorship also happens in today's media. Some examples are TV shows. TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore. Now it's understandable to censor children's shows but shows for mature audiences are unacceptable. Considering the freedom of speech one can express. Also, mature shows are only meant for mature people to watch them so why censor them? Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote. I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don't read or watch it. If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compel others into believing what you think then you are wrong. People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored, as long as it doesn't cause direct harm to others.
1049	4026	2	3	Does censorship solve any problems? If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that argument trying to protect that work from being taken away. As a free country, it is every individual's right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing. History has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road. The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake. But once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their prerogative to choose their own material. Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young. It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read. If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned. For example, take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music. It presents a great mental image of serenity and peace. How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves? Suddenly, right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a certain book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad. Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers. With this system, everyone suffers. Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to. It would all just be simpler if books were just not banned from libraries. History has given the world many a cruel dictator. Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms. To keep his subjects under his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights. This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship. If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes. With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused. Now imagine that censorship occurring in a country that has civil rights. People would not stand for it. So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom? There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing. Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights. There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence. Almost everyone can remember a time as a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble. That can disappear in an instant. Children should not be exposed to things that are inappropriate for their age. Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full - blown adult, materials present in it. The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point. A claim like this might sound hypocritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young. Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children. It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon. The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people. Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship. Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy. Therefore, we should carefully balance the need for freedom of choice and the protection of the young, ensuring that neither is overly compromised.
1050	4027	2	3	I think certain books, such as offensive books, shouldn't be removed. I don't think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better. Kids don't like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us. If this world didn't have movies, kids wouldn't read books. Most of these kids nowadays read books because they watch the movie adaptation of the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading. I'm glad people invented these things. I feel like if people didn't invent these things, this world would be boring. Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on. Magazines are entertaining to people. I say they are because they have pictures, gossip, and much more. Magazines are good to read as they help a lot of people read better. It's also bad because kids read them and start doing what they say in the magazine. Some books are good, some are bad. I say that because some books get out of control with cursing and the covers of the books, well, the pictures. Some authors write good things and some write bad things. Hope you get something out of what I wrote. This is how I feel about books, magazines, music, and movies. I love to read and listen to all of them. I enjoy books a lot. We should accept the diversity of these forms of media while also being aware of their potential impacts, especially on the younger generation. By being more discerning consumers, we can make the most of these resources. P.S. Scholastic.
1051	4028	2	3	When @LOCATION2 was established and our forefathers signed the constitution of the @LOCATION1, freedom was the most crucial aspect. With each signature endorsement added to the constitution, @LOCATION2 became one of the few countries that truly embodied freedom in every right. Laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress their own people. Freedom is the very essence of @LOCATION2 and it is the birthright of our future generations! Freedom of speech has manifested everywhere. Even though some people may express a bit too much, it is still a right granted to us, so we must tolerate the nonsense that is spoken. Offensive remarks are common because we are all different, and the diverse ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 are so numerous that at some point, someone's feelings are bound to be hurt. This is not acceptable, yet it persists throughout the world. Freedom of speech is an unrestricted form of expression, as it allows us to say what we feel, but sometimes it is overused and can lead to conflicts. Speech is still a freedom, and if we eliminate it, we would be in a dire situation. Genocide and unlawful imprisonment are two common consequences of a lack of freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure, you could end up in jail. If you hold different beliefs, armies may come and kill you, all because some countries do not have the freedom that @LOCATION2 enjoys. This freedom may cause controversy and produce offensive materials such as reading materials and videos, but it is far better than living under the rule of a dictator. Crude forms of freedom often appear in magazines, books, and CDs. However, if they are being produced, it means they are being purchased; otherwise, they would not be made. On certain occasions, items are not created for economic gain but rather based on beliefs and religious values, which is also a freedom that many have sacrificed their lives for. Additionally, with the production of books, movies, and CDs, there is a system in place to protect us from being exposed to viewpoints we do not like. These products have a rating and supervision system, and if you do not like a product, simply put it down and walk away. It is that simple. I do not foresee freedom being discarded anytime soon. We may just have to accept the presence of offensive products. We should all be grateful that we live in a free society that allows us to express our differences without fear of being killed. You cannot simply discard the constitution like trash, so society will have to bear the burden of this expressed freedom. Freedom comes in the form of discs and books, but it remains @LOCATION2's defining characteristic and the birthright of our future.
1052	4029	2	3	Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be removed if they are found offensive? I am truly torn as I find both perspectives understandable. Therefore, I will discuss how I feel about this topic in this essay and share my personal experiences. Well, let's get started! I can see both sides of the argument. First, I'll discuss why I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that interests many people may not appeal to me. Everyone should have the freedom to listen to and read what they love and enjoy. I really don't care what others like to read or listen to. Someday, we might all come to appreciate things we never thought we would. It's as simple as that. For example, I love romance and scary books, while someone else might dislike them. No one can tell us what we should like or dislike. I also agree to an extent! When people make a big deal out of certain things, it can be quite annoying, just like when your mom constantly tells you to make sure your room is clean. I understand this @CAPS3 because something might be too offensive to someone, especially if they don't want their children exposed to it. One time, I was in a library looking at a book that seemed really interesting. But then a lady told me I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it was too much for me. However, it was just right for me. @CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was shocked and thought, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude, so I calmly asked her, '@CAPS1, are you really that worried about what I'm reading?' @CAPS2 replied, '@CAPS3, the book is too revealing.' I showed her the book's title, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. Eventually, we ended the argument. I still checked out the book @CAPS3 because I knew I would love it, and I did! People should just set aside what they think might be offensive and let others ask for the things they want. This way, they won't make a big fuss and can keep the peace while giving everyone what they desire. Well, I've shared my thoughts. I hope you can understand both sides of the argument. Remember, whether you agree or disagree, or like me, can't choose and understand both perspectives, it's your decision. No one can make you change what you love to read or listen to. But I can't pick a side @CAPS3 because both viewpoints are reasonable.
1053	4030	2	3	I firmly believe that certain materials that seem offensive to some people should remain on the shelves. It is ultimately up to the individual whether they choose to read or listen to the material. I have personally been in situations where I came across an article that upset me. I have also had an argument with someone who found what I was listening to offensive. Once, while reading a newspaper, I encountered an article that made fun of the town where I grew up. The article claimed that my town was full of rednecks and that many people there were uneducated and unintelligent. This really bothered me and made me feel ashamed of living there. However, I later realized that this was just someone else's opinion. Just because they wrote that article doesn't make it true. Another time, an argument got out of hand. A friend came to my house to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room, I turned on a CD by my favorite rock artist. I loved the music and admired the artist's talent. But my friend walked over to the stereo and turned it off. She told me she didn't like it and that it was offensive. After that, we argued for a long time. I finally told her that I thought it was great music and that I shouldn't have to stop listening to it. We reached an agreement that while she was there, I wouldn't play the music. I decided to respect her feelings. Over the years, I have noticed that more people are taking what others say or sing to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are expressing their opinions. Sometimes, they are stating facts and also sharing what they believe is right to say. If a material is on the shelf and you don't like it, simply don't pick it up and read it. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and allow people to make their own choices about what they consume.
1054	4031	2	3	I don't think so because most libraries in towns and cities are open to the public. If a person or group finds a piece of material offensive, they should simply pass it by or skim through it. On the other hand, people do have the right to freedom of speech, but they should not exceed the boundaries of the law with their opinions. If music is played in the library and some people find it offensive, in my opinion, they have the right to speak up for their rights. Books and magazines should be allowed in public libraries, even if some people find them offensive. This is because public libraries are meant to offer a wide variety of materials to cater to different interests. People have different personalities, which means they will have different preferences. Everyone in the United States of America has the right to express their thoughts, even if it may not be what others want to hear. For example, if someone finds a particular book offensive, they can choose not to read it, but they should not try to prevent others from accessing it. In conclusion, while people should have the freedom to voice their concerns, we should also respect the diversity of materials in libraries and allow individuals to make their own choices.
1055	4032	2	3	I think people are more likely to read banned books from schools and libraries, listen to 'rebel' music, or watch controversial movies. So, is censoring really effective? I don't believe censoring is truly necessary. If you think a subject might be offensive to you, you should simply avoid it. Instead of censoring the products in a library, we should focus on educating the readers. I believe people are mature enough to decide what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Media is a valuable source of knowledge, which is why it is used in schools. I would love to go to my school library and find books like 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'. I know this book is regarded as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literary works, but it was once banned from some schools across the nation. The reason for the ban was that they thought the book contained pornographic content and was not suitable for school. My English teacher used this fact to encourage us to read it. My classmates who hadn't read the book were curious to find the so - called pornography in it. But when I read it, I couldn't find any. Another literary work that was once banned is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. This book was banned because @PERSON1, a black character in the book, was called a @CAPS4 and was sometimes portrayed as stupid. However, @PERSON1 is actually the most noble and innocent character in the book. Some people found this offensive and inappropriate. Movies with strong language are rated to protect the public, so I don't think this should be a major issue. As for music, it depends on the singer's style, and parents should monitor their children's music choices. I truly believe that we should not censor materials in libraries. However, if necessary, an age limit could be set for checking out controversial materials. As I mentioned earlier, media is a means of gaining knowledge. In conclusion, we should trust people's ability to make their own choices and use media as a tool for learning rather than over - censoring it.
1056	4033	2	3	As @CAPS1, we are firmly entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press. However, these fundamental rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries. I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are numerous children that frequently visit libraries, and having explicit content could dissuade parents from allowing them to visit. Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a separate area, clearly marked and off - limits to anyone under a certain age. Even if someone manages to get their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be effectively used at the front desk to prevent them from borrowing the material. Their library card would clearly show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young. Furthermore, I have faith in people's common sense. If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will naturally avoid checking it out of the library. Parents, as well, will surely not permit their children to borrow risqué material. Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings helps prevent unwanted results. There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting unnecessary restrictions on others' freedoms. They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not. That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited. It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just leave it be, and not involve others in the dispute. People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them. I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself. When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do. They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason. However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus. I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that. When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves. The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom. To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it.
1057	4034	2	3	I believe certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and inappropriate. Why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are elements in these items that can hurt people in various ways. But when the people create and read these items, they often don't realize how impactful it can be on those who are purchasing these items from the maker. I also had the experience of coming across an offensive and inappropriate book. When I went to a public library, I picked up @CAPS1 book and thought to myself, 'This might be a good book I can use for my book report.' So as I picked up the book and flipped through the pages, I saw words and images that offended me. There were words that were derogatory towards people of color, and pictures of women of color being raped or abused. So I did not get that book; I just put it back and was angry at the people who treated my culture wrongly. So a @CAPS1 white lady, 'The librarian', came up to me and asked me if I needed help finding anything, but I did not answer her. I just looked at her and shook my head. As I walked through the library, I saw inappropriate books such as '@CAPS2 books' that these kids were looking at. I could not believe what I was seeing. Because I think they should have these books somewhere else so that the younger kids will not have access to these adult books, including the music that always talks about @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs. Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listening to because it can affect their future in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harassment - stuff that will get our younger children in trouble as they grow older. I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.D to prove you are @NUM1 and older. In conclusion, it is crucial for libraries to take proper measures to protect the well - being of young patrons and ensure that inappropriate materials are not easily accessible to them.
1058	4035	2	3	Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Censorship in libraries should never be a complex issue. It is a very straightforward concept. Obviously, no parent wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies. If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to be constantly worried about what their children will encounter there. A library should be a truly family - friendly place where children can gather for story time, or where college students can focus on their studies. I vividly remember going to the library all the time when I was younger. I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community. It was an activity I truly enjoyed. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and have a great time? Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc. It is the clear responsibility of the library employees to place these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building. Parents should firmly tell their children that the adult section is off - limits, and the library employees should ensure that children never enter that restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be far too inappropriate for children. However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they so desire. That's why they shouldn't be removed from the shelves completely, just separated from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc. I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Even though I don't personally see the necessity for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't be able to view these items. All in all, we have to be fair. Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive? No, nobody wants that. However, we still have to be reasonable about it. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed. It's just basic common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope that you can understand my perspective and help me in resolving this issue once and for all. By working together, we can ensure that libraries remain a safe and inclusive space for all.
1059	4036	2	3	We all have that favorite book, mine is ' OF @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 is a book I would whole - heartedly recommend to anybody, but there are libraries that have some books that are so bad I would be terrified if my mom even picked it up and glanced at the cover. My name is @PERSON1, and during this essay I am going to show you what I am talking about. I love to read during the day. I like to go out and simply pick a book right off the shelf and start reading right then and there, but when I see a book or a magazine that contains sexual acts, I become extremely angry. I have seen many of my friends get engrossed in these books and magazines right in front of adults like their mothers. They can go to a public library where children as young as the age of five can read and look at these terrible things. I don't understand why these books are even needed in a library. Now people can get on the @CAPS4.V's and buy or rent them. I have a best friend who lost his father due to these sexual acts and pictures. My friend's mother had enough and had to kick him out. Now my friend is starting to become the same person. He can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steal or rent them from our local library. He doesn't even realize that his father did the same thing. He still never wants to see his father, but what he is doing is exactly the same as what his father did. I have had various talks with my friend, but he said it isn't hurting anybody, but what he doesn't see is that he is hurting me. Back in the late @NUM1's early @NUM2's, parents noticed some of the books that their children were reading. They tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked. Since then, this problem has grown to a point that we may never be able to control. The libraries do this all for the money they make. More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a so - called sex high. This is where about half of the libraries' money is being made. The government tries to stay out of this, because the money they get through taxes is coming from these activities. When will it stop? No one really knows, but we will try to stop it as much as we can. The reason for this essay was to show why this process needs to be stopped. If you go to your local library and really examine what they sell or rent out, you will then understand what I am saying. I will try to stop it, but probably will not succeed. That will not stop me from helping my friends in the future. Just be glad that you know about it now. We must all take action to protect the younger generation from such harmful materials.
1060	4037	2	3	Offensive much? That's what multiple people feel towards certain books. For instance, if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an atheist, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtful to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books, then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines, and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a valuable resource that is very helpful, and multiple times knowledgeable on many important subjects. First, besides books, we have magazines. If we were to get rid of all of the magazines in the world, then there would be a significant cut - down on all those inappropriate advertisements that some men are drawn to. Second, there would be less baseless gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break - ups and make - ups of today's modern celebrities. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt people's feelings, and also, it's offensive the way that some famous people are portrayed. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves. Lastly, there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' If you don't, then I'll tell you a little about it. It's about America, things that have happened in the past and were of great significance. In the chorus, it says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3, - but we tried to fight it. It's always been burning since the world's been turning.' It's a song that is about Americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the beginning of time, these issues already existed. The song inspired many of the famous singers you know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should be familiar with. We should keep music accessible so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and gives hope to Americans. Without music, there would be chaos. Last and furthermore is movies. Where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our entertainment, but some of the best movies are based on historical events. Events that help us get a better understanding and a clear look at what has happened in the past. For instance, the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us visualize events that have occurred and are both enjoyable and very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind. In conclusion, I hope I have created a clear message that you will highly consider. We need books and music to inspire and energize the world, and we do not need magazines. We all need a little inspiration in our sometimes difficult lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive impact on your thoughts and feelings, and that we can work towards a better balance in the availability of these media forms.
1061	4038	2	3	There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a high - resolution computer screen, he will probably only have one or two basic opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two in - depth opinions about the piece of clothing, considering factors like style, color combination, and fabric quality. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act. @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half - dressed and makeup put on like thick plaster. Many popular magazines and well - known books, such as @CAPS1 and books about high - end modeling, portray beautiful as stick - thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many trendy songs and blockbuster movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bustling bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library? Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many well - stocked libraries, there are clearly marked sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to discuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five - year - old innocent child could wander up to the section, take out a colorful magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo - shopped. If a five - year - old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five - year - old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, professional photographers, and even experienced cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many well - known women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body. Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation - wide. The popular magazine, @CAPS1, has detailed articles about how to become skinny. The well - watched television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Women don't work that way. No one does. Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then it would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many women and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else.
1062	4039	2	3	Ever went to a large, well - organized library and seen a book that was too graphic for a certain section. When little kids came into the library, does it seem like they should stay away from that section? Well, censorship should be in libraries nowadays. Many innocent children are seeing bad material at too young of an age. Due to seeing this, they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life. In libraries, they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a clearly marked restricted section in the libraries that only people of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magazines from that section. For example, in large video stores, they have an adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter, not children. Libraries should be that same way but not with the same material as in video stores. Personally, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young, they do not know what is bad for them. So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy where characters are harming other people, they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves. Libraries do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not, then they should make a place where children cannot get a hold of these materials that can affect their judgment. So when taking a younger child to a library, go in with them and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong - doing habits in these books, games, magazines, and music. As long as there is not censorship in libraries, our children will see these behaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking that it's okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in libraries of anything of certain age groups or if it is offensive. Do not let young kids walk alone in libraries so they can come across the wrong material for their age.
1063	4040	2	3	Books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. They have significant value in culture, people's lives, and everything else. We all see kids laughing and enjoying colorful books about pretty ponies and little puppies. What we don't see is how books and magazines are really affecting people of different race, religion, or age. We should take a stand and get rid of these bad books. Negative books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and wrong ideas. We have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are. I remember in @NUM1 grade when a kind - hearted girl named @PERSON1 got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color. In the book, everyone was white and excluded an African - American girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough. She went to tell the teacher, and the teacher quickly threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like. We need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us, to boost everyone's spirits and make them feel better about themselves. The world has changed, and books should too. Many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion. Books that talk bad about other religions or make you second - guess your faith are considered negative and should be taken off the shelf. How would you like it if someone was putting down your religion? That is how many people feel when reading that kind of material. These books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries. Have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching? Most of children's books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids, but not all of them. Behind some movies or books, there is violence and bad scenes. When fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is okay to kill someone if they are bad. Boys believe that it is okay to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies. Girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess, they also have to be flawless. Do we really want children to think it is okay to fight and be upset because they are not perfect? Libraries need to get rid of these books and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world. Not all books are bad, and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer. We need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves. The books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves need to go away for good. To get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden. It can make a really big improvement in adults and children. Please take negative books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems.
1064	4041	2	3	Books @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS4 you're in a large, busy library, there are many books that children decide to read that @MONTH1 not be suited for their @CAPS3. Many lenient parents allow their kids to read those types of books so they're used to it now. But some books aren't for children @CAPS3. Nowadays, kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CAPS4 kids go to the library, they look for books that catch their attention. Some authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad things. @CAPS4 a child looks at things like that, they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. I'm not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will. Some kids mimic certain things they hear, see, and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people, so what they see you do, they will try to do it. I believe that things like books that kids shouldn't read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games, only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see, they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games, and other things. All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3, but some are. I notice that many careless parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People shouldn't think that way because there are a lot of cruel people in this world. I even saw on the news where there was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girlfriends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. There are parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that bookstores or other places sell these types of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include, no @CAPS5 should read. Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inappropriate things in them should be removed from the shelves. But certain people interpret the words differently and view it differently. There are many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf. But it's going to keep going on until someone speaks up.
1065	4042	2	3	The material we read in books is sometimes offensive. Books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them. I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what their child reads. I also believe that censorship is a good thing sometimes. The material we find in books is not as much of a problem to our youth as any other thing. The reasoning for me saying this is that today's youth are not really worried about picking up a book and reading as much as they are about picking up a trendy magazine, a high - tech cellular phone, an iPod, or using a computer. I believe magazines are worse than any book. Books are mostly read for knowledge, whereas magazines are mostly read for people to catch up on the latest fashion trends. Magazines can lead to people listening to the next hottest band, singer, or rapper, whatever. Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics. Then people get pulled in. Music doesn't have ratings, whereas movies do. Movies are a little easier to control because of their ratings, but children are always going to get their hands on it no matter what. This is where the internet comes into play. Most people have access to a fast - speed computer. Children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't meant for them to see. The internet is also used to educate. The internet also opens up the doors to exciting video games. Children can play with their friends all around the world now without leaving their cozy bedroom. They also play with complete strangers. Some of the other players could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music, magazines, etc., that send a bad message. No one is ever going to be able to completely control what our youth see. The only extreme way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet. Even if we do this, there could always still be a way. However, we should still do our best to limit their exposure to inappropriate content through parental guidance and proper supervision.
1066	4043	2	3	One book or movie doesn't make a significant difference in the vast expanse of a huge library full of numerous books and movies. That's precisely why the books, magazines, or movies shouldn't be removed from the bookshelf of the library. They shouldn't be removed because some parents of the children simply don't care what their kids listen to or read. They only seem to be concerned if the kids aren't doing what the parent says. Also, the parents might over - estimate their kids and think that their kid clearly knows what books they want them to get or don't get. Although, if you're one of those parents who not only care deeply about what your children read or listen to, and you realize that every kid doesn't have an innate understanding of what their parent wants, then you should have a conversation with the school's principal and see if there's a feasible way that you could come up with an area of the library that is specifically set aside for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have access to, or ever read. Alternatively, you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they're okay with these types of books. Then there are some kids who genuinely like to read those types of books and would be extremely disappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf, and they were left with nothing else to read, while everybody else in the school got to keep their favorite books in school. If someone were to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable, I would firmly say to them that it's not the book. The kids chose to read the book in the first place, so it would be their own doing if their life changed. Finally, that's the reason why books shouldn't be taken off the bookshelf because some people enjoy them, and if you are one of the kids or parents who don't like them or don't want their kids reading them, then have the librarian make a clear note to say they aren't allowed to check them out.
1067	4044	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once thoughtfully commented, 'All of us can vividly think of a book that we sincerely hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Many people in society whole - heartedly share Katherine's view, while some firmly believe in strict library censorship. It is of utmost importance not to infringe on the rights of other people, suppress freedom of speech, or limit their access to knowledge. Therefore, I whole - heartedly support her sentiment. If materials are thought to be inappropriate for children, or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be established in the home by the parents, not by a public institution. America was founded upon the fundamental need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and of the press. If we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are slowly but surely destroying a nation's core values. Can we really turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to? Furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where exactly do we draw the line? Anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, but that does not mean we should immediately take it off the shelf of an important public institution. If you do not want to take my word for it, look back at history. What kind of civilization was @LOCATION1? Not one you would want to live in, I suppose. Hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom. They started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books. First, it was just viewed as unsavory to have a book they deemed offensive, in this case it was the works of @CAPS1, @CAPS2 - @CAPS3, or @CAPS4 authors. Later on they started to burn these books, and punish people for having them in their possession. If we are to live in a country where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books. This seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequences than foreseen. Many families have different values they want to pass on to their children, morals they hope to teach them. The problem is that each family's limits and values are unique; we cannot just make assumptions about families in general. I personally know a family that is extremely protective over what their children read, watch or listen to. On the other hand, I am acquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read. What one set of parents want to limit their child from reading @MONTH1 can vary greatly from another set of parents. If they find material they do not want their children to read, then they should censor in the home. They could start with a detailed discussion about why the material is inappropriate, and give the child the responsibility to obey their parents. It helps the parents become more involved in their children's lives and it aids the children in personal growth with responsibility and respect. In the end, it all boils down to freedom. Do we want to live in a country with freedom of the press and the right to publicly access it? My answer is a resounding yes, and I believe it is the answer of my fellow @CAPS5 too. We cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different. Therefore we cannot impose our opinions on the public institution, but rather handle it at home. It is not right to limit a whole society's public access to materials because of one opinion.
1068	4045	2	3	Most people generally consider libraries to be an unharmful place. However, it's often discovered that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on their shelves. Kids who are interested in reading shouldn't have to be in a situation where they're looking for a book and end up picking up a @CAPS1 novel with a blatant nude lady on the cover. I truly believe libraries need to have some sort of proper censorship not only on their shelves but also on computers and movies. Let me further elaborate on the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries. A library is a wonderful place to escape and explore your mind in a truly fascinating way; by delving into books! Now, would you want to be in the library, looking for one of your favorite books and suddenly come across an offensive image? Nudity, cursing, and references to drugs are all offensive elements I have seen in a library. It's highly unappealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol sitting right next to a kid's magazine. What kind of confusing message are we trying to send to them? That it's okay to get drunk or engage in sexual activities while reading 'The Magic School Bus'? I think there needs to be a well - organized system set up to go around and help censor libraries. Since the media has a strong hold on the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great and practical idea to eliminate such content from our libraries. Libraries are a reading haven for not only our children but also friends and family. We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go to check a book out and pick out an autobiography on @PERSON1. Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen sooner rather than later. I'm not saying go and discard all the books you have already purchased at some point because that's already in the past. No matter where you are, you can't completely escape offensive gestures; but please, let's do our best to keep it out of the library.
1069	4046	2	3	Do you want your children to be burdened with bad images in their head? Does everybody truly deserve to read or watch anything they want? I firmly believe strongly that these offensive materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have absolutely no place in libraries. These materials are not beneficial for children, they offend people, and they give a bad image to the libraries that carry them. First, I am convinced that there is absolutely no valid reason for any child to be exposed to explicit material. This kind of material can have a negative impact on a young and impressionable child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will wrongly think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she gets proper approval from his/her parents. I know from personal experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very long time. I have had a few truly disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library without having any idea what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was absolutely terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve to feel that kind of fear for such a long period of time. Next, some material in the library contains certain elements that offend random people. Large public libraries often have music with explicit lyrics. As a society, we do not want our youth to be exposed to the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music also offends many adults. Adults firmly agree that there is no reason for any rap with explicit content to be available in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a positive image. I have observed that children listening to rap with explicit lyrics at a very young age are more likely to end up being unsuccessful individuals. Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea is related to my first point, but I will reiterate some of it. Images like blood can sometimes deeply offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this in our libraries. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is detracting from our good world. I have been offended by some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this offensive material. Last, I want to emphasize the fact that specific libraries can acquire a bad reputation if they carry this offensive material. In addition, employees will definitely be more inclined to go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with proper censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that negative gossip to spread around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as essential to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only cause their number of customers to decline. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I sincerely encourage you to go ahead and try it out. Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a steadfast believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only ruin the good reputation that a library @MONTH1 has. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are a real letdown. After all, it is your life, and you get to decide the way you want your children to grow up. Disturbing materials are only going to have a negative effect on these minors. I sincerely hope to see the amount of censorship increase in libraries. If it does, people will notice a significant change in all the issues I've discussed.
1070	4047	2	3	As the Katherine Paterson's quote aptly states, everyone can realistically think that they have the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if they deem them offensive or inappropriate. However, this should be an individual decision and not a collective effort where other parents rally together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books. In today's modern times, so much content is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't considered so when the previous generations read or consumed it. When parents read these things today, they feel these items are inappropriate, whereas when they were teenagers, they thought it was acceptable. Of course, in today's highly technological age, kids can easily get their hands on just about anything if they know how to navigate the digital world. So, if parents start censoring items, it gives the kids an incentive or a reason to read or listen to it; and disobey their parents. They also end up getting an unconventional or unintended education. So, if parents censor, the kids are given multiple reasons to go against their parents' wishes and read or listen to the restricted content anyway. That is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually, they will come across it. Do you really want that situation for your kids? In conclusion, it's wiser for parents to have open discussions with their kids rather than resorting to censorship.
1071	4048	2	3	The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been widely discussed by many people from different walks of life, but a definite decision has never been reached. I firmly say that there should be no library censoring. I vividly remember that I would not have found my deep - seated love for reading if libraries were censored as they sometimes are. I wholeheartedly think that there should be no censoring of libraries because it would severely impair our basic rights. Such as our fundamental right to freedom of expression, which allows us to explore diverse ideas, and our right to freedom of the press, which is essential for an informed society. If libraries were censored, we would no longer live in a truly free country but rather a totalitarian state.   Though if they would put an age restriction on certain materials, it might please the debaters. I believe that many would agree to this if it was properly proposed. Thus, if we did this, children would only be able to read or listen to materials appropriate for their age. However, it is the parents who should primarily censor what the children read and listen to, not the libraries. It's the parents who first introduce the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on, this long - standing debate would not be going on as it is.   The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over the past years. Some want to censor our libraries, though that is clearly not the best choice. As @PERSON1 wisely said, 'that if we have the right to censor libraries, then there will be no more books for any of us.' In conclusion, we should oppose library censoring and let individuals have the freedom to access a wide range of materials, with parents taking on the role of guiding their children's choices.
1072	4049	2	3	I do not believe that such things as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries. First, books are invaluable as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults alike. Just because a book talks about the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying, it may be a little inappropriate for some very young age groups, but it is extremely relevant for teenagers and adults. Also, books give a vivid message about how times used to be. Take a book that refers to slavery and what they used to call black @CAPS9 back then. Just because it has some words that are now frowned upon does not mean that kids and @CAPS9 shouldn't know about it and where it came from. This knowledge can prevent them from going around offending @CAPS9 without even knowing what the word means.   Next, movies. Now, some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups, and I fully understand that. But movies like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 are teaching us about our @ORGANIZATION1 and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each other's race. Also, movies offer a more visual way of showing what things were like, so we can get an interactive sense of how things looked and how we can relate the book to the movie. Movies also make important points. Some state that if we don't do anything about pollution, this is what's going to happen. So, movies are definitely a must - keep on my list.   In addition, a big factor of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 is music. I can see how some music could be bad, but also some artists talk about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a getaway for them. Plus, music isn't hurting anybody. We can learn how music was in the @DATE1 and compare it to music now. We also learn how music evolves from one form to another, kind of creating off of itself. Music has the power to say things and communicate with @CAPS9 and make statements that could only be made by music. For example, take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think. Now take that speech and put it in a song form, and I guarantee that more @CAPS9 will capture the message and take it to heart on how they could help the cause, especially if it is by their favorite artist. Say your favorite artist is @CAPS7 @PERSON1, now wouldn't you rather listen to @CAPS7 @PERSON1 make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by @ORGANIZATION2. So, music is most definitely staying on the list because it has the power to move @CAPS9, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in a way before.   Last, magazines. Some magazines are just inappropriate. Now, I'm pretty sure that you will not be seeing those magazines on the shelves of a library, so nobody should be worried about that. Now, some magazines like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 are just there for fun and they are not hurting anybody because it's just pictures, and honestly, no child would read the words of an interview with a famous person. So, magazines are harmless in a library and are only there to keep people up on current events and to inform @CAPS9 on if a new discovery was made or what's going on in the @ORGANIZATION1.   In conclusion, I do not believe that things such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere. These materials play crucial roles in education, entertainment, and cultural understanding.
1073	4050	2	3	"Some things on the shelves in bookstores and other places can be very offensive. I think having cuss words in music and sexually explicit things can be particularly offensive to women. I do listen to some music, but nothing like that because I firmly believe it should not be in music and books. One day, I think the @CAPS1.S.A will be run by a woman. There is nothing wrong with that. Women have the same rights as @CAPS2 do. There are some people that think women are just household slaves, but that is dead wrong. Women and @CAPS2 are equal in every way, no matter what people say.   Katherine Paterson has the right idea, though. It would be great if the law would state that if you think something is offensive, you should be able to take it off the shelf and throw it away. But some people would oppose this because there are some people out there who just care about themselves and act however they want to so they can make themselves feel better than they are. There are some kids who like to look through magazines and see all those bad things and think that those people are cool, so they learn how to act and do bad things. That is why I think we should be able to take such offensive materials off the shelves.   There was this one day I was in @CAPS4 - mart just looking around, and I saw a magazine with some movie star holding her three kids. The title of the magazine was ""superstar"". It really hurt to see those three kids on the cover because one day they may not be like their parents and have all the money in the world.   It may seem really stupid these days that some people would care this much, but I really think deep down that it's life, and we all need to get over ourselves because we can not all be right and have all the same feelings for life. All my life, I have thought about this subject because it seems like now days it's all about the money, what they wear, and what type of car or truck they drive. It seems really stupid, but when I see someone who drives a new car worth @MONEY1, it really makes me think about how someone has the money for this car and everything else. In conclusion, we should take steps to remove offensive materials from public spaces, and we should also reflect on the values that our society currently prioritizes."
1074	4051	2	3	Libraries. What things are found in libraries? Well, libraries contain more than just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of these things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have materials for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them. The library in my town has certain areas for children, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1 - rated things. Not all people agree with what should be allowed in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be interesting to them. Even though some of the things they choose might be different from what the public expects.   When I go to the library, what I think I would mind is if I saw some @CAPS1 - rated things. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want, I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Having these areas would help parents and children feel a lot better about what they would hear or see at a library.   What can be done about this problem? Even though it may cost more or be too difficult for an owner of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be a good thing to do. If smaller children see things such as violence, drugs, and sex, they may think that it is okay to do. Most parents try and keep their kids away from those parts of the library but don't always succeed. So, therefore, I think that building rooms for these areas is the right thing to do.   Even though we all think different things should or shouldn't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money than some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child, would you have liked to see some of those things? If you ever have kids, would you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So, try and make the better choice when you find inappropriate things for younger viewers. In conclusion, creating age - specific areas in libraries is a practical solution to balance the freedom of access and the protection of younger patrons.
1075	4052	2	3	As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I think we all can agree with this view. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read. I, however, firmly believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults. When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn. Yes, they may choose another book and learn from it too, but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.   Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.' It is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver. I have never seen this movie, and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to. It seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for this discussion because what some do not want to learn from, others can. I would never watch it or anything like it, but my friends who have watched it have learned something. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless, then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.' I kid you not, after hearing about this sad video, it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless.   This brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, this video can not be on the internet,' none of my friends would have seen it or told me about it. Therefore, I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person. Then, when I was older, I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.   In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn. We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool. If we all took away the materials that we felt were inappropriate or needed censorship, then we would have very few learning materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We must respect the diversity of learning resources and the rights of individuals to access them.
1076	4053	2	3	Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place where one can go to relax and engage in reading. Most of the books and movies available are filled with explicit content such as sex, gang violence, and drugs. In my generation, the prevalence of sex, drugs, and gang violence seems to be at a high risk everywhere. Books are supposed to be a source of learning. Offensive books and movies can set bad habits in younger children. These are the reasons why offensive books, movies, and also magazines should be removed from our local libraries.  Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open a magazine, you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of offensive behavior. You should be able to open a magazine and learn something brand - new. Books are useful for research papers and other school projects, but sometimes you can't find what you are looking for because of other topics. The reason you can't find what you're looking for is that every book or magazine you look through is covered with the topics you don't want. As a teenager, each book I look at is always about sex or gang violence.  If younger children continue to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit in that child. They say you are influenced by what you read. Bad habits could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking, and pregnancies. That's why all parents should have guidance over their children.  Being who I am, there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazines in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. They drive children to places they don't need to be, and you won't be able to learn if you have too many bad habits. There should only be books and movies where you are able to learn something in your local library. By removing offensive materials, the library can truly become a safe and educational space for everyone.
1077	4054	2	3	In The @CAPS1, I read an interesting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson, an accomplished author. The @CAPS2 stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - the work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I firmly believe that people should not have the right to take materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So, I whole - heartedly agree %@NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opinions. Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people. I have observed people, and we're all different, so why should our thoughts be the same? The answer is clear; yes, they should be different. But it is pretty simple: if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful, then put it back. Another person might find it interesting.  I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said. I am asking for your help to do so. I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it. Thank you for accepting my @CAPS4. By engaging in this discussion, we can better understand different perspectives and uphold the principle of diverse access to knowledge.
1078	4055	2	3	Most of us have had times when we are really engrossed in a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, inappropriate pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to include this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book clearly tell me that there was offensive behavior in it? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It @MONTH1 even make some people lose interest in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.  The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child, on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.  The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice; they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, it respects the people who hold their morals too highly to read offensive material.  The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.  Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil and pleasant trip to the library. No more worries about accidentally coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that goes against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magazine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will then contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the option of having offensive material on their shelves. It's truly a win - win situation for everyone.
1079	4056	2	3	Should books that seem offensive to you be taken off of the shelves? I know that most people who agree think that it would 'better' our kids if they didn't read or listen to certain things. But, what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the shelf?  I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of its contents. If I look at a certain book and think, '@CAPS1 book is offending me and my beliefs,' then I should just not read the book. Just because it is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offend someone else. Every book that has ever been written has affected someone, either in a good way or a bad way. Does that mean they have the right to say, 'take them off the shelves?'  I remember when I was in second grade, there was this girl in my class whose mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked. The parent was extremely angry at the teacher and, at that time, I didn't know why. Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying. The teacher never played the music in class again and was too afraid to play any other type of music.  Since everyone's views are different, by the time every person took off the books that offended them, there would be no books left. As Katherine Paterson put it, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  In conclusion, I strongly think that books, whether they offend someone or not, should be kept on the shelves. Taking the book off wouldn't solve any problems to begin with. Instead, it would limit the diversity of ideas and knowledge available to all. We should respect the right of every individual to choose what they read and not impose our own sensibilities on others.
1080	4057	2	3	I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelves in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material. Some believe that @CAPS1 shouldn't be around in libraries for children to read, while others think we should have offensive material because @CAPS1 might help someone one day. Sometimes when people think of offensive material, they only think of the bad aspects and not the good that people can gain from reading or watching it because @CAPS1 might not seem to be treating people right. However, some offensive material like videos or movies can be very entertaining and make the movie great to watch. Today, I'm here to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, @CAPS1 can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and @CAPS1 can also teach us more about offensive material.  Today in our generation, we do a lot of studying or projects for school. We do this so that we know more about the subject. As a high school student, I would research the topic about offensive material. Why would you ask I do this? Because by researching this offensive material, you can learn more about @CAPS1. Like where did @CAPS1 come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you already know, and that's a great thing - finding out what you don't know. So, if we take away the offensive material, we would never get to learn more about @CAPS1 or know where @CAPS1 came from. It's beneficial to still have books that are offensive material because it educates us not to be offensive.  Going to a library is fun and exciting because you get to read all these books. Well, when you choose a book, you can choose the most recent one or the one from the old days. In our case, we have offensive material on the shelves in libraries. Let's just say you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days. Well, in the library, they will have generations of books on offensive material. This provides us with information about offensive material back in the old days. So, the library is a great place to have that because we need to know about what happened back in the old days.  Everyone goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book. Well, I know a lot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material. Offensive material to people is like a good book; you can read @CAPS1 and learn more about it. Some people think learning too much is a bad thing, especially when @CAPS1 is on offensive material. However, learning too much is not even a valid concern because people can learn whatever they want to. If the libraries take away the offensive material, @CAPS1 is just like taking a good book from you.  People can think what they want to think about offensive material. As I said before, if libraries take away offensive material books, it's like taking away a good book from a reader. People do need to learn about offensive material, which is why we still have the books. If we didn't want to know about offensive material, why did they publish all the books and videos about @CAPS1? By keeping offensive materials in libraries, we ensure that people have access to a wide range of knowledge and can make informed decisions about their learning.
1081	4058	2	3	To whom it may concern: Can you really take away books just because someone might find them offensive? Do you truly believe that racism is a part of literature? Currently, libraries are considering removing various items such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory under the guise of censorship. They think that individuals might take offense to certain beliefs presented in the diverse entertainment options available in the library. However, these types of entertainment should not be allowed to be removed from public or private libraries.  In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for the sake of censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies, and music are being removed simply because some individuals might find them offensive. People may disagree with certain beliefs related to their lifestyle and personal values.  Literature can be seen as an art form that an individual interprets in their own unique way. It has existed since the time when humans first learned to write and continues to the present day. This means it has witnessed wars, politics, art, and slavery. All of these aspects are integral parts of literature, so in a sense, literature is history itself.  Some people argue that offensive material should be removed from libraries. They might even think it should be eradicated from everywhere. But it shouldn't be. It is a part of our history. Can you really take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at a particular time, what was going on in that part of the world, and what the opinions of people were back then. Many people today believe that racism is wrong, but we shouldn't ignore the fact that there were those who once thought it was right. They might have believed that white skin was superior to dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs as long as they respect ours.  Literature is crucial to society and how it functions. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are today. Literature should remain on the shelves of libraries where it rightfully belongs. Personal opinions are an inherent part of books, and we should respect that. Would you want to be known for destroying an important part of history?
1082	4059	2	3	Many people hold different views and opinions on various matters. It's important to note that no opinion or view is inherently right or wrong. Books, music, and movies that spark controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves. This is because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make decisions for everyone.  Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't force others to see things from their perspective. For instance, if someone visits a library and deems the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series offensive, they might be the only one with that opinion. They can't simply tell the library to remove the books just because they're uncomfortable with them. In a democratic setting, decisions often go by majority rule, and that single person is not the majority. They're the only one with a problem.  Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. If someone comes across a type of music that they find offensive, they can't demand that the store remove it. One person can't change everything to suit their needs. Removing that type of music would make plenty of other people unhappy. To maintain harmony, the person who finds it offensive could simply choose not to listen to it. There's a vast selection of music available, allowing people to find something that doesn't make them uncomfortable.  One person cannot make decisions for everyone. Even the president doesn't make decisions alone; he has the government to assist him. If one person believes a magazine is inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it. They're not in charge, so they can't be the one to alter the magazine. It might be inappropriate to some, but there are other people who enjoy reading it.  I firmly believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't impose them on others. Books, music, movies, and magazines are some of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject matter within the material. Some of the content might be inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it. Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they desire, and one person can't make decisions for everyone. In a diverse society, we should respect each other's choices and rights.
1083	4060	2	3	Should someone's work categorized as 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' be taken off the shelf and made unavailable for sale or viewing in stores? If you think so, then do you also believe it's okay for the campaigners running for @CAPS1 to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is precisely what happens when someone writes an article or a book and has it published for distribution in stores or libraries.  When someone spends a significant amount of time, perhaps months or even years, writing a book on a particular topic, they usually have a deep interest in it. It's similar to when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public, announce the party they're running for, and share their beliefs and disbeliefs. If it's acceptable to remove a book or a magazine from the shelf because people consider it 'inappropriate,' then maybe we should re - evaluate what campaigners are allowed to say during live broadcasts.  Even if you enter a store and see nude magazines on the shelf or CDs with lyrics containing cuss words, do you think those should be removed as well? There is indeed a time and a place for where such things should not be displayed. For example, when you visit a store aimed at little kids and these inappropriate items are out in the open for the kids to see, it can have a lasting impact. Kids have a remarkable memory, especially for things they shouldn't be exposed to. Like when they read a story about someone robbing a bank or listen to a song referring to drinking or using drugs. When kids see or hear such things, they're more likely to be influenced and try things that we hope they wouldn't.  When someone invests months or years in writing a story, they hope to get it published and be rewarded for their hard work. They strive to have it available in stores so that people can purchase it. Whether it's music, movies, or books, the principle is the same. Things should be put on display, and people should have the opportunity to see all the different types of music and stories that exist.  If things were to be removed from shelves or not put on display, people would likely stop creating. Musicians would stop recording music, actors would stop acting in movies, and writers would stop penning ads and books. If this were to happen, people would not be exposed to new knowledge. If there are no science books or biographies being written, nobody will learn about new things. The same goes for music and movies. If people spend a long time writing a new album or coming up with a movie idea and work hard to complete it, they expect to share it with the public. If it's finally out and then removed because someone deems it 'inappropriate,' songwriters and actors will probably lose the motivation to create again.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that if someone creates something, whether it's writing or recording, that has taken them a substantial amount of work and time, they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone believes that an item is 'inappropriate,' they should keep their comments to themselves and not have the item taken off display. There are people out there who enjoy things that may not be considered 'appropriate,' and the creator clearly thought it was good enough to share. So, we can't assume that just because one person finds it offensive, there aren't others who will appreciate it.
1084	4061	2	3	What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't present yourself in a certain way because you might offend somebody? Clearly, not just one person or group of people has the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are numerous different religions and traditions across the @LOCATION2. It would be completely ridiculous to set a single standard for all people. If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apparel, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resourcefulness of the libraries and restrict the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.  When one visits a library, they expect to find a wide range of materials such as books, magazines, and movies on almost any subject. It would be extremely frustrating to discover that a library, which is supposed to be a repository of knowledge on nearly every topic, doesn't have what you're looking for. Suppose you're interested in a book about the assassination of @PERSON1 and you ask the librarian where you can find it. You'd be disappointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they're considered too vulgar for young children. This could become a significant problem and severely limit the library's resources.  Not only would censorship in libraries limit the available content, but it would also impede learning in the @LOCATION2. How are people supposed to stay informed if they're being shielded from knowledge? Many people who don't have access to computers rely on the library. If they can't get what they need at the library, where else would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they don't provide library - goers with the content they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests might break out, and rebellious citizens might protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.  The people aren't the only ones that would be affected. The censorship itself would surely get out of hand. @CAPS1 are already subject to censorship through news stations, radio, and TV shows. Libraries are a place where infinite knowledge is accessible, and that's a comfort for many @CAPS1. In libraries, people can choose what they learn; they aren't forced by teachers or parents. The censorship might start as a minor intervention, but it could have far - reaching consequences and turn our nation upside down. Before we know it, our decisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost, and opinions would be forgotten.  Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were censored, not only would the knowledge in the @LOCATION2 decline, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 fought hard to earn us our freedoms, and we can't let censorship take them away. We must protect the integrity of libraries as a source of unfiltered knowledge.
1085	4062	2	3	@PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE2, @DATE1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 You should be able to read any book, listen to any music, and watch any movie you want, right? Well, in some libraries, that's not always the case. Some people find books, music, and movies offensive and believe they're not suitable for public libraries.  In a public library, I firmly believe that all books should be available for checkout. Some books may contain more adult - oriented material, but that's okay. For such books, the library should offer an adult section. This way, the person checking out the book can make the final decision if they think the book is appropriate for them.  Regarding music in libraries, it shouldn't be subject to over - zealous censorship. The lyrics might be inappropriate, but most teenagers listen to that type of music. For younger children, they should not be allowed to check out music that is more adult - oriented. In my opinion, for music that is more adult, you should be at least thirteen years old. Children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out such music. Some parents may not be aware of what their child has checked out from the library. So, children under the age requirement should have parental consent to check out any music.  I think that some movies should definitely be removed if they are found offensive. Some movies have scenes that are truly horrible and should be restricted to the adult section. In a library, you don't expect to find movies with very adult material. At a movie rental store, you might expect to find adult - oriented movies, but not in a public library. Movies for kids to check out should be educational, fun, and most importantly, appropriate!  Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' That statement is exactly right. I wouldn't want @CAPS1 little cousin reading books with racial comments and just plain inappropriate content for a child of that age. Even if the child doesn't understand all of the content, they will ask questions that the parent is likely not prepared to answer. As children, they might get the wrong idea in their heads and say things that are not right.  In public libraries, books should generally not be censored, movies should be carefully censored, and music should have age - appropriate restrictions. It all boils down to what you allow your children to read, watch, and listen to. This is a debate that has occurred in several libraries regarding the content of the material. Now that you know my opinion on censorship, maybe others will also consider this an important topic and have a more informed discussion about it.
1086	4063	2	3	Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and that's precisely what has allowed our country to thrive and prosper through many years. In the constitution, it clearly states that there is freedom of the press. This means that if something is written that might offend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might argue that certain material is offensive, and sometimes it truly is. However, I firmly believe that books, magazines, etc., should not be taken off the shelves merely due to the feelings based on another person's thoughts.  In @LOCATION1, over the years, things have gradually become more acceptable in media and books. The rights have always been enshrined, but they were not fully practiced. There have been instances of book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for their writings. For many years, this unjust situation persisted until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader, more open perspective. Though such issues still occur, I think it is very closed - minded. In some cases, people wrongly blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone as the reason for a murder.  I do think there is a limit to how certain books and magazines are distributed. For example, they shouldn't sell a book about death, poverty, or sex at a public school. We all have different things we like to read and write about. So, why should we be deprived of our choices just because someone thinks it's too offensive? I think not. If you don't like it, then put it down and let someone who will read it pick it up.  With my own experience, I have seen bad people do what is expected of them, bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen. That's just an easy way out of a situation. I have read and seen very intense things in my life, but does that make me want to do bad things? No! I know I can't speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines, etc., are not harmful. But think about it like this: wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace something from it rather than go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new horizons and is scientifically proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read, the more awareness and knowledge you gain, and just because you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more. In conclusion, freedom of speech and access to diverse reading materials are crucial for the growth and development of a society, and we should strive to maintain and protect these rights.
1087	4064	2	3	Nowadays, children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading material you can imagine. Some magazines, books, and movies are age - appropriate, carefully curated to suit the young minds. However, children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines, books, and movies. The question arises: should we remove these inappropriate items? Can we somehow get kids to not see them?  Children are very curious by nature. They have an insatiable desire to know about everything and will ask as many questions as they can. When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, it poses a real dilemma. What should we do?  Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that @MONTH1 be inappropriate for children. Instead, there should be a well - defined rating system on the books and magazines. Just as movies have ratings so that children don't see things that are inappropriate, books should have those ratings too. If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids, then they can show the librarian their @CAPS1, which serves as a verification of their age. In this way, everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age.  Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate, clearly marked section of the library. It could be a section that kids could not enter, perhaps with a locked door or a visible barrier. Parents should also be vigilant and watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate.  The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity. Children can look onto the shelves, but we should put clear labels on what they can and can't check out. Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read. I believe that's the most practical and reasonable approach we can take. By implementing these measures, we can ensure that libraries remain a safe and educational space for children while still respecting the rights of adults to access a wider range of materials.
1088	4065	2	3	There are many libraries with a vast collection of books, magazines, music, and movies. Some of the things in a library are inappropriate for children. So, currently, the library makes a section for the adults and a section for the children. However, I think there should just be a dedicated children's library and then make another library for the adults.  In most libraries I've seen, they either have an upstairs for the adults and a downstairs for the kids. Downstairs, they also have toys for kids. This way, if their parents want to go upstairs to browse the adult section, the kids can sit there and play with the toys.  Then I also firmly believe that they should take off the bad things on the shelves. Because what happens if a kid goes up with their mom or dad and opens a book and sees something very inappropriate? It could have a negative impact on the child's innocent mind. So, these inappropriate items should be taken off the shelves in a library. If someone wants to buy them, then they will have to go online or to the store and buy them.  The people that own the library or are in charge of the library should take all the bad magazines, music, books, and so on off the shelves. It is a very bad thing to have such inappropriate materials at a public place, and that should not be allowed. The public libraries should take all the inappropriate things off the shelves. In conclusion, creating separate libraries for children and adults and removing inappropriate materials from public library shelves will help create a more suitable and safe environment for everyone, especially the young readers.
1089	4066	2	3	Libraries have a rich collection of books, magazines, movies, etc. The library is a wonderful place to read in a quiet and peaceful setting. It can also, however, be an offensive place to some people. They think they can complain and bicker about it, but the question is: should all those activities be removed from the library shelves? And whose opinion is it anyway?  If I found an offensive book, movie, or magazine on a shelf at a library, I would just leave it alone. Apparently, it's not considered a bad thing because if it was, they wouldn't have it on a shelf. So, if I got offended by it, I wouldn't look at it or pick it up. I mean, it's that simple. A library is full of, well, about everything you would enjoy. Many different people like different books and movies to read and watch, which means the library has a right to put whatever they @MONTH1 want. Even if it is offensive to some people.  With my experiences in a library, nothing has come across to be offensive to me. I'm a kind of person that doesn't really care. However, I have seen some books where the author is making fun of the @CAPS1 people. Also, I've seen a book where the author is writing about the black people and how they used to be treated, and some of the book has the @PERSON1 in it, which is a major form of racism towards black people.  It could be an unfair situation to some people that have kids with them and an inappropriate book is on the shelf and they see it. That could be offensive to the children and the parents. Or it could even be in a magazine. But why should the books, magazines, etc., be taken off the shelves when it's not offensive to all people? If the librarians took all the offensive books off the shelves, then there wouldn't be many left. Everyone has different things that can offend them. If you don't like how the book is, you can take it to your friend and they can read it or you can just turn it back into the library. You can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive content it has given you.  Books, movies, magazines, etc., are all in a library. They could be offensive or not. If you think they are, then don't look at it or read it. It's that simple. In conclusion, while offensive materials in libraries may pose a problem, a balanced approach that respects the diverse interests of all patrons is the best way forward.
1090	4067	2	3	If we remove all books we think shouldn't be on the shelves, what would there be left to read? So many books have great detail in them, which can give us a vivid picture about what we're reading. Even at times, the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming. I don't think we should have to remove books, music, movies, etc., just because they are found offensive to some people.  Instead of removing the books others love to read, what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music. Or put the books some people find offensive in their own area. If all books were rated like movies, we would clearly know just what we're buying or checking out. Movies are rated by the language and content they have in them. Books should be the same way. Or if someone was to find a book or magazine offensive, they should be put in a different location with a label identifying that they could be offensive to others. I do not think they should just be removed and out of the way.  I think having books that are too offensive should be put on their own bookshelves. By doing this, people would know not to let their children go near them because they have been labeled. And like rated '@CAPS1' movies where a minor needs to be with an adult, with books, you should be fine with your own choice at the age of @NUM1.  In my opinion, this would be a great idea to be implemented and should be done. There's a bunch of books I can think of that would not be suitable for young children. Yet little kids love to read and could easily take a book off the shelf if they so pleased.  Many parents complain about what their children read, watch, or listen to every day. Labeling would be such a great way to control a bit of what they hear and see each day. I think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it. I'm not saying to throw away the offensive books, music, movies, etc., but to label them so others know what they are going to read or see. I believe this would be an excellent way to make sure our children don't read the things we as parents wouldn't want them to read or check out. In conclusion, implementing a rating and labeling system for library materials is a practical and effective solution to balance the rights of all readers while protecting the interests of children.
1091	4068	2	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've recently finished reading a quote by the great author, Katherine Paterson, and her thoughts regarding the certain type of material used in books. For example, some @CAPS1 @MONTH1 might be offended by a certain type of language used in books. Other @MONTH1 may just feel the pictures are not quite appropriate. With that being said, I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with, you should just pick up another book instead.  My belief is that many authors view a book as a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world. Authors shouldn't be denied the opportunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings. @CAPS1 shouldn't be allowed to give hateful opinions just because they didn't like a book. As I see it, no one is forcing them to read it.  Now, I'm not saying I'm an avid reader. As a matter of fact, I barely read, but when I do start reading, I sometimes become eager to keep on reading. The way authors describe things, even with sometimes profanity, is just amazing. You can actually feel that you're part of the book. Now then, my point is that even though to many @CAPS1 a book @MONTH1 might be horrible, to others it @MONTH1 could be the best book in the world.  So, if you do start taking down books from the shelves, you would end up with nothing but a huge, empty shelf. There's no book out there that is what we would consider, 'The perfect book.' @CAPS2 book can be given a nasty comment, but then again, @CAPS2 book can also be given the best comments.  This world is too big to start picking and choosing. My beliefs won't be the same as yours, but this is how I feel, and this is how I will keep on feeling. So, tell me, what's your belief then? In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of books and the rights of authors, and make our own choices about what to read.
1092	4069	2	3	Have you ever gone to a library and found that some books aren't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well, I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading.  I have visited multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way too extreme for kids to be reading or watching. I personally think that children who aren't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed to rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books.  Some of you are probably like 'but it's not like they're going to know what it means.' @CAPS4, if children don't know what something means, then that definitely won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands - on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or 'mommy, what does this word mean?' No parent is ready to tell their child at the age of three what a four - letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child, then that's when you can bring out the older books or movies. But don't let them read it on their own. Usually, kids will start asking about more adult things when they hit the age @CAPS5 and up. That's when you as a parent can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.  Twelve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on their own. That's when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid, we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way too extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen, then usually kids are fine on their own; they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handle it.  In conclusion, I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines, and movies should be kept away from ages one - @CAPS5. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. Then once they hit high school, they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about. This way, children can grow up in a more appropriate and healthy media environment.
1093	4070	2	3	Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children. I do agree that certain books are not appropriate for some children. Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries? Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can write what we want on paper because it's what we want; it's called freedom. Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the appropriate age groups.  Books are a great part of a student's learning. Parents need to learn and understand that no matter how much they don't like it, they can't protect their children from the world forever. Some day, they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves. How would children and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual content on @CAPS1.V.? If students never know, how will they live?  Books can be educational in many ways. Some things a teenager might be experiencing, a parent might not want to talk about with their child. Maybe the family can't afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books. If students can't have access to them, then what's the option for them? Everyone knows how today's society is changing. If a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's, they should be able to if the age is appropriate.  All libraries check out books so the book is under a name. I know at our school, students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out. If schools had books that are for only a certain age group, a solution to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up. So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked, they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out, the computer knows what books that specific student can get.  Books are very important to learning, and all books need to stay and not get blocked by parents. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects both the rights of authors and the needs of students of different ages should be adopted to ensure that books can play their due role in education.
1094	4071	2	3	Censorship in libraries? In my opinion, I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading, but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with profanity. In my opinion, that is just the author's way of how he or she wanted to do it.  I believe that libraries should keep these types of materials on the shelves but have them in sections, maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors and producers. That is their work, and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone... Well, listen, there are heaps and heaps of books out there you can find that are not bad!  If you are more of the movie - type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family, and then all of a sudden, the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half - naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it, then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family - oriented and safe for children's eyes.  So, just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of foul language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their minds with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role model and teach them about healthier viewings. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of choice in reading and viewing, while also guiding others to make more appropriate choices.
1095	4072	2	3	Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indecent to read or not.  We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday, we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things, so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What @MONTH1 might look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong @MONTH1 could be completely normal to the individual they are making the decision for.  Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media, then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things; that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisions is one of the human race's greatest talents. These decisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that affect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom?  When censorship of television comes into question, I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. These ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age - appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check - out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books too?  In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from the public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types of movies, books, etc. can save a lot of people from hurt or embarrassment.  I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth - given right of making our own decisions. This right should never be taken away from us. In conclusion, a reasonable rating system and parental responsibility can ensure a proper balance between freedom of access to media and protection from inappropriate content.
1096	4073	2	3	I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that. Just like Katherine Paterson had wisely said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us. Everyone has the clear - cut choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not. If they do not want to, then they simply do not have to. Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either.   Honestly, there are some overly - sensitive people who take offense to everything. If they do not like the book or whatever it may be, they do not have to read it. I often find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking.   However, I do agree that there should be certain reasonable standards set for some of the books out there. Some books are extremely graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to reach a certain age to be able to read them. But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves.   Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book '@CAPS1', for example. In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly. But, the author did not write the book merely to tell everyone about her experience. She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help. This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to vividly show the agony the girl had went through. Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them.   Books are not the only things that might offend some people. In certain department stores, there may be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively. Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned? No, and why might that be? Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not.   Another place is the @CAPS2. If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the @CAPS2 then there are in books. Kids can get on the @CAPS2 and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the @CAPS2? No, because the @CAPS2 helps in a lot of ways too. If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library. Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics. I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer. Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it.   So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained. Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a wonderful variety to choose from. Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out. After all, we are not forced to do anything. All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own, and embrace the diversity of ideas and expressions that these materials offer.
1097	4074	2	3	Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive. Books, movies, and music were created for a very good reason. It's not only a form of entertainment but also a means to build knowledge. Artists, authors and publishers painstakingly release their work to get important information out and to let others hear their unique voice, it is their freedom of speech.   Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive. Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society. If all books on the @CAPS1 were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincarnated. The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons.   Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valuable or interesting information. People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing so casually. The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our personal decision to make. It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves. If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benefit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material. Banning things from the public takes away opportunity for people to engage in things that interest them.   Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a fleeting thought. The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' had multiple occurrences of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone. It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening. Small things such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it.   Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us. Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material. There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone.   Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason. Not only is it for entertainment, but it is also for knowledge too. Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech, and we should respect this fundamental right.
1098	4075	2	3	Did your child ever bring home a book? A piece of music, movie or magazine? Did you ever pause to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else?   There are points in time where there isn't a straightforward answer to that question and you don't want to choose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that it's not fit for a child to be reading. Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Her point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf every time that someone doesn't think that it's right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see.   In agreement to Katherine, parents usually want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and there are also books out there that are way too advanced to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have their own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and carefully think of their children and then think of the rest of the world. It's a big world and you can't just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isn't a fool - proof way that you can stop it.   I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no valid reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. Libraries can't just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that don't like this or don't like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they don't always know the difference between right and wrong.   It's a bigger world out there than you and me. When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace? We should respect the diversity of opinions and the freedom of expression in the world of literature and media.
1099	4076	2	3	I don't think that censoring books and movies is needed in my opinion. Very many people are just overly protective. They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts. Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in their life. Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment. You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older.   The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get their way at least in their community. I think that libraries should be organized in a very systematic way that when you walk in you clearly know the section you want to be in. They should have the books for adults in one well - defined section, books for teenagers in a different distinct section, and books for kids in another separate section of the library too. This would greatly help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot. This would also assist in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is.   Another good thing that would help in a library are clear signs that categorize the books. So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book. You just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are prominently placed. This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don't know how to search for their book in a library.   The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too. They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be separated to where the signs in the section say movie and music. This way kids don't have to wander around aimlessly to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it. The movies and magazines don't have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well - known than books in our time period.   A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright and attractive colors that will grab their attention. If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they may just wander into the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don't want them to. The kids section could be full of lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one vibrant color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors.   All of my ideas would work and keep all of the kids entertained. They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library. These are the only ideas that I have that would work well. There could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit. Overall, a well - organized library can provide a better reading environment for everyone.
1100	4077	2	3	To remove or not to remove  Should people be able to remove books that are offensive? I think so; it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics.   To start off with, everyone has their own distinct opinion of what is offensive, and what's not. Personally, I don't think that we should remove books just because they're offensive; I think we should just not let that particular person put out anymore books. But it's like I said, everyone has their own opinion.   Secondly, it's entirely up to the library where to place certain books with blood and gore, and if to have them or not. Personally, I like books with blood and gore; because it shows how the world actually is. It's not like a fairy - tale book where you save the princess or damsel in distress.   Lastly, if parents are concerned about offensive books, don't let your kids get those kind of books. Give them a boring but educational book. I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents sometimes let kids read them.   In conclusion, if you feel that a book is offensive, don't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with you. We should respect the fact that different people have different tastes in literature, and instead of seeking to ban books, we should focus on guiding readers to make appropriate choices.
1101	4078	2	3	I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons, but to save some time, here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this. Firstly, there would be no books left for anyone to read. If certain books were taken off the shelf, we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay, one might understand the advantages and disadvantages of censorship in libraries. For instance, if many books were gone, what would happen? If we all took off one book that we found offensive, then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person, say in a particular month like January (@MONTH1), finds offensive, another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that 'a well - known classic' (@CAPS1) is an offensive novel, but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand, we also have to understand that there are some things that just shouldn't be put out in public. But if we remove too many books, would we get as much knowledge as we have? Without all the books that are in our libraries, would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn how to do things. I myself have learned how to become a successful mystery (@CAPS2) novel writer (@CAPS3) from the tips (@CAPS4) I took out of 'A Mystery Writer's Guide for Beginners' (@CAPS5). Also, would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries? Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library, people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be creative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books? Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries. I myself, on one hand, do not find it appropriate, but on the other hand, it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly, without the books that we have, no one would know what someone in a different part of the world was thinking. Foremost, people who want censorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here, but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books.
1102	4079	2	3	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines in the world. Some are humorous, historic, or romantic; however, some are offensive in some way. People, perhaps during a certain month like March (@MONTH1), get offended when they read or listen to certain things, but does that mean that those things should be removed from the shelf? Some people in that month might find something offensive while another person does not. Therefore, the music, books, movies, or magazines should not be removed from the shelves. If a person thinks that a song should be removed from the shelf and it does get removed, what about the person who did not find it offensive? People are entitled to their own thoughts and feelings. However, that doesn't mean that one person's feelings are better than someone else's. If everyone tried to make everyone happy, then there wouldn't be a lot of options to choose from in the library. If one person finds something offensive in a book, another person might find another book that is offensive, and it goes on until there aren't any books left. With entertainment, it is hard to please everyone. No matter what it is, there will always be at least one person who doesn't like it. This, however, does not mean that it should be removed from shelves. If one person does find it offensive, then there is most likely someone else who doesn't. The people who don't find something offensive want to be satisfied, too. It is impossible to please everyone, so what should be done? If someone finds something offensive, they shouldn't read or listen to it. People can choose to quit listening to a song, quit watching a movie, or quit reading a book or magazine that they, in a particular month, might find offensive. They have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it. This way, the person who isn't offended can still enjoy their choices of entertainment at the library. If I find something offensive, I try not to pay attention to it. There are many books or songs that I do find offensive, so I just avoid those. By avoiding these books or songs, I don't offend anyone else by taking away something that they might enjoy. I still am satisfied, and so are they. The library workers know what they are doing. If the library takes away a book because some people find it offensive, then they might be offending those people who didn't find it offensive by basically saying that their morals are better than yours. A library should take a book or magazine out if it feels necessary, but not to please certain customers because then they aren't pleasing the other customers and could offend them. People have the right to voice their feelings, but that doesn't mean that they are always right and that certain things should be changed because of them. It is impossible to make everyone completely satisfied, but there are compromises. The libraries shouldn't remove things off their shelves but should give more options that won't be offensive, and people should avoid the things that they find offensive.
1103	4080	2	3	Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are books, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer. The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today. For example, some old historical records might have offensive language used at that time, but they are crucial for understanding the social context. Another important reason why library censorship is wrong is that material that one person, say in a particular month like June (@MONTH1), finds to be offensive may not be offensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation is achieved. In most cases, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people can be able to look back on these events both now and in the future. In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrich the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material might be to them.
1104	4081	2	3	Do I believe that any book or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense? No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else. If the book was good enough to be published, that means someone wants to read the book, which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion. In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' What she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf, then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc. at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material. If someone finds something offensive, they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everything they come across, which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the book or other form of material offends you, that doesn't mean that it's worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores. Don't get me wrong; I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their books, novels, poems, etc. I believe that if something is offensive to you, that's your opinion, and there's an easier way to not have your children read the book than getting the book removed. Just don't bring the book to your children and stay away from the book as much as possible. If you, perhaps in a particular month like September (@MONTH1), come across it, just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a car - crash than reading an inappropriate book, only if you teach them correctly. Not to sound harsh, but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores.
1105	4082	2	3	Dear sir or madam, Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive? Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, movie, or magazine was removed from the shelves? Would removing every book, CD, movie, or magazine from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language, and other inappropriate things be helping the community? Do you believe that it's everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves? I believe that a lot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them. I bet people all over the world have read offensive books. But the only types of people that those books, movies, or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids. But at the time, they wouldn't see it as offensive. They would think that it was cool and interesting, and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it. Then they would go back to the library and get another one. I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves. Because if only that one book, movie, or magazine was removed from the shelves, then the person that got it removed would move on from that book, magazine, or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive. If every person were to remove every book that they were to find offensive, then other people who would enjoy them would not be able to obtain it. If everyone were to find all kinds of different books, movies, or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves, then there wouldn't be very much left for the community. In conclusion, I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the community's choice. If someone wants a good book, magazine, or movie, they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get. If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get, they should just choose what they think is interesting and ignore the offensive parts. By doing so, a balance can be achieved, and the library can still serve as a valuable resource for the community.
1106	4083	2	3	Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you found it offensive, perhaps due to its inappropriate language, disturbing themes, or controversial viewpoints? If so, how did you handle the situation and what specific actions did you want to be taken? I know from my own experiences that I've come across some offensive materials, so I'm certain they exist in libraries. There are numerous rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone a reason to take something off the shelf, and these can vary greatly from person to person. If you were in a children's library or a school library, I'm sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, inappropriate situations, or extreme opinions should be removed from the shelves. Now, if you were in a public library's teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are present, it might be acceptable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off the shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it. In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. This is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a valuable learning tool or a great read. As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' This is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future. I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' In conclusion, finding a balance between allowing diverse materials and protecting vulnerable audiences is crucial for the proper functioning of libraries.
1107	4084	2	3	Today in our modern day and age, we have an abundance of books, music, movies, and magazines that contain content or display materials that young children and teens should not be exposed to at their ages. I am writing to your newspaper company to express my belief that censorship should be more strictly implemented in libraries. There should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that requires the parent to sign a statement saying, 'My child can see or hear the materials being displayed.' In this century, we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows that blatantly display violence, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. It's almost impossible to shield all children from these things, but we should at least make an effort. There are shows on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 now depicting teenage pregnancies, and they are misleading the viewers into thinking that it's okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. @ORGANIZATION1 shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize without any consequence. Also, they feature violence and unnecessary language. I know from my own experience of watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 that my dad has come into my room and told me to turn it off, stating that they shouldn't be allowed to show such things to the viewers. I know that when I am married and have children, I will keep my kids away from certain materials for as long as I can until they are old enough to understand and know the right thing to do in such situations. Some of the language they use, such as 'retard', I find highly offensive. In my opinion, the level of censorship in libraries and in households has really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A responsible parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching are appropriate for their age. Even books have sexual content and inappropriate language. When I have children, I will make sure that they are reading materials that are suitable for them. Magazines these days are even worse. They are called the '@CAPS6 @CAPS7' for a reason, and young teens are picking them up off the shelves at convenience stores and reading them. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, references to sexual activity, or sings about drinking or drugs. Parents need to be more involved in their children's lives and monitor what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can access so easily without any proper censoring. I hope you read this essay and really take it into consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you for your time. In conclusion, it is essential for parents and society to work together to ensure that children are protected from inappropriate content.
1108	4085	2	3	I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive. Children shouldn't be allowed to read books that have inappropriate pictures on them, such as explicit images or disturbing illustrations. Censored material can have bad influences on children, shaping their values and behaviors in negative ways. Scary movies can make children have nightmares, causing them distress and sleep disturbances. There should be restrictions against offensive materials. Libraries contain a wide variety of books, music, movies, and magazines for everyone. They are a valuable resource for learning and entertainment. However, libraries also have some offensive items in them. Offensive material should be removed from libraries. Children don't need to see inappropriate material in libraries. Inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids, leading them to imitate negative behaviors or develop wrong ideas. Censored material such as offensive language, smoking, and alcohol are extremely bad influences on children. Children don't need to learn and use cuss words. Smoking can lead to serious health problems like cancer or even death. Alcohol is also addictive and can cause a person to become violent. Children shouldn't be able to see these inappropriate items in libraries. Scary movies can give children nightmares. When I was a child, I saw a scary movie and I couldn't even sleep that night. I was filled with fear and anxiety. Inappropriate movies need to have ratings so that kids don't watch them. Kids tend to believe most of what they watch in movies. Movies should be restricted from children to watch them. There is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children. Bad influences can have a long - lasting bad effect on children's development. I believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children. In conclusion, protecting children from offensive and harmful materials in libraries is an important responsibility that libraries should undertake.
1109	4086	2	3	Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up, or even carefully watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents' responsibility, not the library's. The library is a place to go when you want to get a book, a movie, a magazine, etc., whether it's for enjoyment or research. That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read. If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in their opinion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library. Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow? If an adult or a mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves just because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book or even teach them that those books are wrong, it would be a great loss. The parents have full responsibility if their child is reading something that is inappropriate in their eyes. How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong. If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie their child is picking out. Most libraries have a children's section anyway, which provides a more suitable environment for young readers. It is not the library's responsibility to watch out for your child; it's the parents'. Their job is to supply the community with a diverse range of books, movies, magazines, etc. Libraries should keep the books on the shelves so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read. In conclusion, parents should take charge of guiding their children's reading choices, while libraries should maintain their role as a repository of diverse knowledge and entertainment.
1110	4087	2	3	Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive, perhaps due to their religious beliefs, moral values, or personal sensitivities. People often argue to get the so - called corruptive books, magazines, movies off the shelves. However, the customers have the choice not to check out the material, and it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf. People who go to the library have the option to read the book or not. If they have heard bad reviews about the book, then they can simply ignore it. The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and it's not to be taken off just because some people don't care for it. Reasons might be that the book goes against the beliefs of a particular religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf. Everybody has different likings and tastes when it comes to books. Just because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's. Beliefs and standards differ from person to person, and that is why the liking of books varies among most people. Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive. If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you don't want them reading, then simply tell them that the book is inappropriate. The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back. This is a much better approach than trying to get the book removed. Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library. Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read. When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you come across one you find inappropriate, then just ignore it and continue with your day. It's as simple as that. In conclusion, respecting the diversity of reading materials and individual choices is essential for the proper functioning of libraries.
1111	4088	2	3	It was during @CAPS1 class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher carefully picked up, was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their unwavering devotion to the home. I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive. There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason. Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression. People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge. A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material. Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. 'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time. It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. That example proves that material that's regarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what makes a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library. In essence, libraries should preserve the diversity of materials to fulfill their educational mission and respect the freedom of expression.
1112	4089	2	3	I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive. In fact, different people have different sensitivities and perspectives, so what one person finds offensive may not bother another at all. People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4. It would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. If we had a library specifically for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. The same thing applies to movies and magazines. You could more precisely locate the content you desire. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses. Building and maintaining separate libraries for different media would require a significant amount of resources. Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book you're looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive. You can make an informed choice based on the labels. Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be. Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. There are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs. I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of books and handle offensive music more carefully to ensure a proper environment in libraries.
1113	4090	2	3	I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you. People shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf. If it's their children they're worried about, just teach them from staying away from the adult section. For example, explain to them why certain materials are not suitable for their age. Also, some people don't like foul language but that's their opinion. It's a matter of personal preference. Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson). If it's your children you're worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books. You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship. Before checking the material out, skim through it to make sure there is nothing offensive for your child. This way, you can take proactive measures to protect your children. Many people don't like foul language but, that's their opinion. It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting. Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing. Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story. For instance, strong language can convey intense emotions. Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left. This could effect peoples education and reading skills. Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson). It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong. Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read? Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better. I don't know what I would do if there was no more books. Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them. What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you? In the end, we should balance the protection of children and the preservation of diverse library materials.
1114	4091	2	3	Removing certain books, music, movies, magazines, and so on is a serious question to ask. Well, some believe it's a good idea, on the other hand other people don't. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. If you ask my opinion I would have to side with not removing certain books, movies, music, etc. One of the many reasons why I believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion. Some @MONTH1 find a book offensive, well on the other hand some @MONTH1 find it riveting and not offensive at all. People have different tastes and values. If the person thinks the book is offensive they should simply not read it. They should not have to ban books, music, movies, etc. just because some find it offensive. Well others @MONTH1 find things offensive that the other person does not. We all have our own beliefs and we should be free to express them, as long as it doesn't involve breaking any laws. Another reason why I agree with not removing certain books, movies, and so on is because we might not have any left. Like I said before we all have our own opinions. Not every single person is going to say a book, etc. doesn't offend them. We should not have to take away certain items. But on the other hand I believe we should restrict certain books, movies, music, etc. If a book, movie, etc., seems to complicated for a child to comprehend, then they should not be able to read, watch, etc., the item. We should classify things based on knowledge, understanding, and maturity. This way, we can ensure that the materials are appropriate for different audiences. Also I believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe. Just as we all have choices. I can agree with some of the arguments other people have for removing certain books, and movies, etc., but the main idea is to do what is best for everyone. I just don't see that removing every book, movie, music, etc., will solve any problems. In fact I truly believe it would make matters worse. There would be arguments of what to remove and what not to. In conclusion I believe we should keep libraries the way they are. It would keep things less complicated. Also it would be the best choice. By maintaining the diversity of library materials, we can accommodate different needs and promote a more inclusive environment.
1115	4092	2	3	A @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Have you ever been in a situation where there was a movie that you really wanted to see, but due to the graphics in the movie you were not allowed to see it? Many parents or young adults believe that movies being @CAPS1 are a good thing. They think it can protect children from inappropriate content. What they do not know is that if something is @CAPS1 that's just going to make the kid want to go see it more. The forbidden fruit effect often comes into play. First of all, if the kids want to see it badly enough they will just sneak in or get a copy of it off the internet, which is illegal. I remember when I @CAPS3 younger me and my friends always wanted to go see @CAPS4 rated movies. So we would have our parents drop us off. When we would arrive home our parents would ask what we saw, we would lie and say we saw the new @CAPS5 @CAPS6 movie. Therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing. Secondly if you don't believe your child should watch a movie because of your religious beliefs, then you and your child should have a talk. Statistics show that the more the kids can talk to their parents openly and come to an agreement, the less the child is going to lie and go behind their parents back. Many parents come to an agreement, that if they get to preview the movie first then they will decide if it is appropriate for their child to watch. In many cases this works out great for the parents and children, for if the adult gives permission for the child to go see it then the parent and child will have something to talk about when they get home. This can enhance the parent - child relationship. Finally, I believe movies should be uncensored. For the movies are not really that bad, your child will end up seeing it one way or another. Whether it's at a friend's house, the internet, or going to the theater. What harm could it cause to see it now. So in conclusion to my statements. To know that your child will see this movie, wouldn't it be okay not to censor it. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' as said by Katherine Paterson is true. Could you imagine living in a @CAPS1 world? I know I can't. So think are you for or against censorship. Would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw? I know I wouldn't. In summary, we should trust in open communication with children rather than relying solely on censorship.
1116	4093	2	3	There are all kinds of different people in the world. People hold diverse views on things, some with strong opinions, and others who are very outspoken and mature. A lot of those people are the authors of the hundreds of books that fill our school libraries. Some schools censor certain books from the libraries because they think the tone or message is inappropriate or too violent. However, I firmly believe that we have a right to these books.   In my opinion, no book should be censored from the library. Our troops are fighting for our freedom of press and freedom of speech, and censoring books completely ignores these wonderful freedoms our country has given us. During my freshman year, we read a book called '@CAPS1 @NUM1'. Before we read it, our teacher briefly told us about what it was about. She said the book was about how a society had banned books as if they were drugs or something that could harm us. Now, apparently, a school didn't like the idea of a society banning all books, so they banned this book from being read to their children. If you actually read this book, it portrays how bizarre and crazy it would be to have all books banned. Yet here we are, banning a book about banned books! Does this make any sense?  To be honest, by the time you're in high school, you've probably seen, heard, and done crazier things than what's in the 'banned books'. I know there are some people who would say that just because you do things you shouldn't in the first place doesn't mean you @CAPS2 to read about it all the time and fill your head with ideas about it. I agree to some extent because most of the things high - schoolers do, they shouldn't. But that's life, plain and simple. In my opinion, high - schoolers are really mature enough to handle some offensive language or violent scenes. I'm sure they see worse stuff on television or sometimes in their own homes. One of my good friends is @NUM2 years old. She has two jobs, her own apartment with her boyfriend, and isn't supported by either of her parents. This girl still goes to high school, has great grades, and is obviously very mature for her age. Yet, even she isn't allowed to read a book with some offensive language in it.  I think our society 'babies' us a bit too much. When we get out into the real world, things aren't going to be censored or kept quiet. I think high schools @CAPS2 to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature. When we go into the workplace after college and start our lives with careers, homes, and families, we @MONTH1 be too immature to deal with it. I know some people who are! Censored books are just a way to keep the way we live life hidden from some people and never let kids grow up and experience things.  We have a right to these books, just like the people who write them have a right to do so. If they can publish them, then we should be able to read them, no matter what our age is.
1117	4094	2	3	Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? '@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1. 'I firmly think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. In present - day libraries, it's necessary to oversee children when they're looking around. If children see something they want without a guardian, they shouldn't get it. It's just that simple.  Although some books may seem inappropriate to some people, they shouldn't be taken off the shelves. Older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days. They teach them some of the ways we use now and show real stories about people in modern - day. For example, some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 make some people think of them as being abrasive and mocking. But in fact, it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about @NUM1 also seem provocative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing. However, these books teach kids that not everyone is nice and that cruel things happen to some good people. There are also books about people's lives in libraries, talking about what happened to them as kids or how their parents died of cancer. These books teach children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad.  Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see. For instance, pornography and provocative language. Pornography is generally considered entertainment for adults. But many times, it can scare kids at young ages if they don't know what's really happening. Also, provocative language in a book or on a CD is not something kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words, they should know not to say them so they don't get into trouble with their parents.  Books of history are usually helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time, this is correct. About @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them. However, there is @PERCENT2 of children who will just think of the information they're being told as good things. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't just wake up one day and decide to bomb the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. His devious plans and clever masterminding took a lot of time to plan out.  Some people @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but I think it's necessary for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs of their country and the others surrounding it. Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what's wrong with the economy, but they'll soon learn when they're adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people. But in the long run, books are used for many things. We still learn about people from hundreds of years ago.  Children will soon learn about the harsh conditions and the reasons why things happen. Without the books and the videos, the future will never know what happened. Many young people @MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened. That's why I think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children.
1118	4095	2	3	Reading is very important for kids these days. Libraries should have the right to have any kind of text, movie, magazine, or genre of music that students can learn from. There aren't any books that could be deemed offensive in any way these days. However, there are exceptions, like any book written to specifically target a race, religion, or gender. Such as books written by raving racist fanatics like members of the @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 - @CAPS2's.  As a high - school student with a nice library in my school, I've learned a lot from the books there. In my @CAPS6 years of @CAPS4, I've never seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them. I can assure you that there isn't one book in the @CAPS7 that would offend me personally. This isn't to say that there aren't books out there that will offend certain people.  Reading books is fun for me. I wouldn't want to miss out on a good book because a library isn't holding it just because there's a slight chance that someone somewhere might get offended by that certain book. Reading shouldn't be limited based on content because there's always someone out there looking for that specific book for a good read. I've heard of people getting mad because there was a nude picture in an art book. Seriously? An art book? Art has had naked people in it for thousands of years. Why should it start to offend people now when it didn't before? People are just strange these days, I guess.  There are certain movies that should definitely be removed from library shelves, like porn. Porn should never, under any circumstances, be held in a library. There are special places for porn, such as the internet. Music is a different story. Music shouldn't be taken out of libraries because there are some people who can't afford to buy music from places like @LOCATION1, iTunes, or @CAPS3. Music has so many genres that it's impossible to decide what should and shouldn't be in the library. There are so many different types of people in the @CAPS7 who listen to different types of music. It would be wrong to tell a certain group of people that their music is too heavy or too 'rappy' for the library. However, listening to music in the library is a different matter. You definitely shouldn't be allowed to listen to your music in the library, or at least not loud enough for everyone else to hear it.  I don't read magazines much, but I know enough about them to know what should and shouldn't be allowed in a library. Magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@ORGANIZATION1' should definitely be allowed into a library because they're a great source of learning. However, there are magazines that shouldn't be allowed, like '@CAPS5' and other pornographic magazines, as well as ones like '@CAPS6' which target young girls, making them think they should look perfect like the models in the pictures. These types of magazines make young girls dress skimpily and inappropriately and make them turn to unhealthy ways to keep skinny.  There are definitely some things that should be kept out of libraries. But one book, one movie, one genre of music, or one kind of magazine shouldn't lead to all of them being excluded. One problem shouldn't make them all a problem. Libraries are a place where people go to escape, similar to things like @CAPS7 of @CAPS8 and other video games. People should have the right to go to a library with the intention of getting something and be able to get what they came for.
1119	4096	2	3	What is @CAPS1? @CAPS1 is what made this country what we are today! There are many ways people can express themselves in today's world. The arts of writing, acting, and art are a huge part of how people express themselves. Since all of us are different and have different views on the subject, I'm not going to preach to you about what's right and what's wrong. I'm just going to share a few previous experiences. All of these were from being in libraries. Some were in smaller towns, others were in the heart of a larger city. There's even a story of a man and wife in the suburbs of a larger city. It's also amazing to see what's accepted in different parts of our country.  Well, it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 library. It was a small group of friends, and we were all working on our research papers. Then, we saw a man and a woman, whom I perceived as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly in front of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine, she looked over to him and proclaimed that it was so derogatory against women. So, he put it down and walked out. Curious about what was so bad about this magazine, I walked over to the rack and saw a woman standing in her underwear with a classic car.  About a month later, I was walking into my local library, dropping off some books for my mom. As soon as I opened the door, I heard two people having a heated conversation about the painting hanging on the back wall in the adult section. It was a painting of a woman with her chest exposed. Mind you, this wasn't a modern painting; it was rather old, with the paint slowly peeling off. That painting had been there for many years without anyone saying anything, and that was the argument made by the head librarian. There were many people standing in the area where this was taking place, and many of them weren't even willing to hear what the woman had to say because the painting turned out to be very famous and had been there since before some of the middle - aged people in there could remember.  As you can see, there are many different views on what's accepted in modern times. Advertisement is everywhere, and many magazines use people's bodies to draw people to their ads so they can sell their products. I believe there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of advertising. They @MONTH1 have to come to an agreement that each magazine should state if it contains that kind of adult content. If they were to make this a law, it should be right on the front cover so you know if you pick up that magazine, you're at risk of seeing such things. However, when it comes to a painting from before the @DATE1 that has been in the same place for years and has been seen by generations, I don't think that painting should be taken off the wall. There's a fine line when it comes to what information is acceptable or not, which is why I believe there should be some kind of rating system for books and such.
1120	4097	2	3	@PERSON1 is saying we should all share, but then never gives @CAPS4 back. Also, we can't all get what we want at the same time or at all. If a book is popular, they should have bought more copies to sell for the other people who don't have the book but would like to have @CAPS4.  Of course, sharing is better than wasting your money on something when someone you know has the book and would let you borrow @CAPS4. And yes, we all know that most people these days don't usually share.  To tell you the truth, you don't always get what you want. You should either get over @CAPS4.  Yes, @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1, but to tell you the truth, everybody has their own opinion. We don't all have to listen to what others say. But if you agree with that person, then you agree.
1121	4098	2	3	I am writing this essay to persuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay, I will reflect my views on this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many past experiences. I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children's section shelves of our libraries that is far too advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have carefully reviewed many of the books in the children's section of numerous libraries. When doing so, I noticed that a significant portion of the material making up this section is either far too advanced or too profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagination more and not let their heads be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children who read today need to have more material offered to them that they can understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Let's put more suitable books on the shelves of our library and stop wasting our money on unfit books. In reaching the conclusion of this article, I hope that I have persuaded the readers to understand the point I am trying to make. I sincerely hope my readers take the information I have given and put it to good use.
1122	4099	2	3	Libraries are important community centers. Both children and adults frequently go to libraries to check out new books that could offer them fresh experiences and valuable information. If libraries were to take out books simply because they were considered inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never get to have those new and diverse experiences. A qualified library requires all sorts of books to meet the various needs of its patrons. If libraries start censoring their books, then it's possible that other materials might start vanishing as well. Most young adults are interested in reading books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. For instance, a person might find a mystery book with a serial killer as the main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one individual, and furthermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the opportunity for another young adult to have the experience of reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not represent the thoughts of all other teenagers. Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi - billion dollar industries to second - guess their work. Take the movie industry, for example. The movie industry might start second - guessing the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The effects of censoring books and magazines go far beyond the libraries. Music artists might also be affected. Rappers often curse and swear in their music because it is their way of voicing their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a well - known rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is considered offensive, then he would lose his job and his career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people. Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen - play writers. If movies were all about unicorns, the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they remove books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work.
1123	4100	2	3	Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2, violence, and some nudity. This kind of movie should not be on any kind of shelf. It's far too inappropriate for kids to see or even read what the movie case says. There should not be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures. It's really bad for the kids to see or hear such things because one day a little boy or girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and end up getting in trouble. It's just wrong to see other people naked, in my opinion. The only person I want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years. But I don't want to watch a movie and see a lady nude. The next thing is violence. Man, I just wish guns weren't invented or bombs. Because I have lost a large number of friends to guns. I lost about six cousins in the war when a bomb hit their area. More and more people are going out and buying guns and bombs because of movies and what people say in books and in magazines. People are getting the names of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and then getting them and obtaining bombs off the black market. People get these dangerous ideas because of movies. Last but not least, @CAPS2 is the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. They learn it from movies mainly because the actors say the words. Now the kids know how to say them. Studies say that kids say and do what their favorite actor says and does on and off the air. My conclusion is that everything with violence and inappropriate content should be taken off the shelves to protect the well - being of our children.
1124	4101	2	3	Throughout history, there have been numerous books written at a time when the beliefs of that era on certain things differed from what our world today believes. As our world has evolved, the views on slavery, women's rights, religion, and many other aspects have changed. These views were based on what the majority of people in a particular time frame believed. I firmly feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, it does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to avoid it themselves, but it is up to each individual to decide whether it should be banned for everyone. Our government grants us the right to have freedom of speech. This clearly shows that even though someone might write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people cannot simply ban something based on what it might say or portray. In my life, explicit music seems to be something that some people are attempting to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age where I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to. I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based on language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children, just as movie theaters do. However, they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child directly says it is fine if his/her child checks out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is acceptable for that child to get that book. The choice of what is appropriate for each child should be left up to their parents. If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few, if any, books. In almost all books, someone might be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive show us what was wrong with society at that time and help us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1, it shows how society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and that their purpose in life was to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that women had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today. If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines, or other items, then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want, and libraries cannot take that away from them.
1125	4102	2	3	I believe that the children of today should be able to read and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past. They should learn through the same teachings, books, movies, and other educational resources. Learning things this way would be much better than taking out cussing, swearing, and certain detailed writing. Because if you took all that away, it's like lying about history and what really happened. Should the children of today be deprived of the truth? Would you want your children going to school every day and learning things from a textbook that were twisted around just so that it was appropriate and non - offensive? Think about it. Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? I didn't think so, so why start now? Say your child is going to be reading '@ORGANIZATION1' in @CAPS1 class today. Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the '@CAPS2' word and the word 'slave' out of the book? By doing so, you would be depriving them of the knowledge of how there used to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments. You would be depriving them of actual history. Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning appropriate? No. I wouldn't. I would want my children to learn anything and everything about world history. I firmly believe that there should not be censorship in libraries as it is essential for children to have access to the unadulterated truth of history.
1126	4103	2	3	Libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages. Some individuals in @MONTH1 argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf, but I beg to differ. A library holds numerous books, various magazines, diverse movies, etc. that can effectively advance the knowledge of citizens. Libraries can, and probably do, contain materials that are guilty of being offensive, but they shouldn't be taken off the shelf because of this. Instead, libraries should be divided into well - defined sections based on topics. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book based on racism, then the parent simply keeps the child out of that section. How will children learn about what goes on in @LOCATION1 if they are not shown? Children won't know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early. This doesn't mean that a child should be shown a magazine highlighting @PERSON2's next drug scandal, but showing them that stuff like this does go on and you should not live that way. Libraries don't contain material that is offensive without a reason. What if a high school student is doing a report on the rise of teen - pregnancy? This student should have no better source for information than a library. The library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic. These books that a library holds are not only there to educate us, but to entertain us as well. If a library removes a biography on the rapper, @ORGANIZATION1, because he has a 'rocky past', they in @MONTH1 lose one client who came to the library to be amazed by the struggles that many successful people have overcome to get where they are today. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' If a library censors all of the material that goes through the system, there in @MONTH1 not be any books left to entertain ourselves. Therefore, libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf as it is essential for the diverse needs of all patrons.
1127	4104	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries nowadays, some are from @NUM1 years ago. Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to freely remove any type of book off of a shelf. Books, music, movies and magazines are all made to interest people and what they enjoy reading. Authors and publishers should not be penalized for their hard work they achieved. There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books. But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story. I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story. I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book. Because I only enjoy reading about the romance. I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship. It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories. There may be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation. Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life. Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in. I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminated from the shelves in libraries. In conclusion, libraries should respect the diverse reading preferences and keep all types of books available.
1128	4105	2	3	Censorship, only for the light - hearted. We have had this issue for as long as man can remember. Since we were only little kids to adults. Everything was censored. Bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what @NUM1k spelt. I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for too long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand. I am a high - school student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just ridiculous. It's the most hypocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but that's okay because it's in a science book. However if it's in a normal book, everything's a big deal and we can't handle it, big woop. I say it's a library, let us read what we want to read. Like I said before high school is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered. I'm not saying just completely take it away but come on now I think high - school students can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book. As far as movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should of course be censored, but if there's just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie. So the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people won't just take away music and books from us high - schoolers for a few bad words. Censorship is for the light - hearted, and nothing is stopping the light - hearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just don't read it. In the end, a balanced approach to censorship is crucial for high - schoolers' access to diverse media.
1129	4106	2	3	Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2? Books, music, and movies all have a distinct meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keep us all occupied when there's a lot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library. People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decide to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching. Genre comes in all kinds of different types. For example, there's only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be carefully picked out for a child to read and a child only. There's also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a child's hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand. All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own well - marked section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section. All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kid's desired book is a children's book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not be taken down from any shelf, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media. By maintaining this system, the library can serve the needs of all age groups effectively.
1130	4107	2	3	The libraries have to worry about enough as it is with people not returning books and stuff in. They do not want to lose their books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find them offensive. Why would we have to talk something out that offends one person but no one else has complained about it being offensive. I know that you are asking me to think like you to be able to see why it is offensive but I don't see how a book is going to be offensive. When someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take it. There are people out there who would read something that is offensive to them so that they can learn from it. There is no reason why if you don't like the library that you can not go to a different one. There is no reason for you to have to get so offended of books because the author is just trying to get their point across and expressing their feelings on the subject. The way that I look at it is that you have two options. The first being deal with it and go to the library and get books. The second is don't go to the library if you're going to be able to find something offensive. But know if you pick the second one then you must realize wherever you go you are going to find something that will make you feel offended so you might as well just get over it and say yeah I will go because it's all around me. Yes I know what you must be thinking why if it's not a big deal then why don't you just take them out. Well you want an answer and I will give you one. Those books maybe you don't want to read them. But what if someone else does it's not fair to get rid of something just because a few people find it offensive, now is it? Therefore I say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything else out of the libraries. You will just have to deal with what you don't want in here it's not like we're going to make you read something that you take offensive to. We will not get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has. That is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library to meet the diverse interests of all patrons.
1131	4108	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, as I was growing up in my small, cozy neighborhood, life could not have been more simple. For children, life mainly consists of eating delicious meals, having peaceful sleeps, engaging in exciting play, and bursting into hearty laughs. Their innocent minds rarely ponder the deep meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does seize every child now and then. With a stubborn and unwavering persistence, a child would probably go to the far - off ends of the earth to understand the confidential information they overheard their parents talking about. But @CAPS1, does harmless curiosity truly mean the destruction of a child's innocence? By casually viewing adult - oriented material, such as certain books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be quite harmful to their healthy development. However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spends countless painstaking hours writing that book. That book represents a significant portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 will find the contents inappropriate. Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is completely unjust. A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite spending long hours in practice. Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work. Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no valid reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society. Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author originally intended. Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a unique portion of the history of the human race. Even fictional novels serve as remarkable monuments to the depths of man's imagination. Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material might seem. Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 can save authors from repeating such dishonorable content. In other words, if censorship removes the'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that'mistake'. By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature. @CAPS1, books are not'mistakes'; they serve as important reminders of the high - points in literature. All literature, whether appropriate or inappropriate, is a precious piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret. Finally, who is to judge what is a'mistake' in literature? A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 might be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 could be sacred to a @CAPS5. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Furthermore, for any given book, there is at least one person who disagrees with its message. A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person. If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests. The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government, library, or activist group. Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privilege of the reader to decide what is appropriate. Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them. Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes. And these'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself. Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult - only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent. -@ORGANIZATION2.
1132	4109	2	3	There are many different perspectives on censorship in our country. This is the human race, which is highly opinionative. Different perspectives come from different people: the young, the old, parents, and children. In libraries, there are some reading materials that some @MONTH1 might find offensive. Offensive material in libraries is @CAPS1 clearly not directed to be read by young children. They are also @CAPS1 not intended to be able to get their hands on such material. Even though this is @CAPS1 not the purpose of that material, it unfortunately happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it. No, the material is @CAPS1 not held under lock and key, but it is also @CAPS1 not left to lay at a child - high shelf that would seem appealing to them. The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelves, except for the children's books. The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories. If we protected children from censorship in this extreme way, this would deny knowledge, and also a form of escape for some, from the general public that annually go to the library. @CAPS1, all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be. Some material @MONTH1 @CAPS1 might be appropriate for children, but they also are @CAPS1 not all inappropriate. A rated '@NUM1' movie @MONTH1 might be just like a rated '@CAPS2' movie only with one extra reference, that @MONTH1 could be taken in the wrong way. Even protective parents @MONTH1 might allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate. Libraries should @CAPS1 not remove this material from their shelves. If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children's books in a separate room of the library. There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children. All of which do @CAPS1 not have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves. Censorship in libraries is a controversial subject. There is a very good argument on either side of whether or @CAPS1 not to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries. I believe it should @CAPS1 not be taken off and there are alternatives to this. This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone.
1133	4110	2	3	@STATE1 @NUM1, @PERSON1, IN @CAPS1 Katherine Paterson, I read your article in the newspaper yesterday about offensive books in the library. I whole - heartedly agree with you on this article. Some of the books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me, but they can be completely normal to other people. There can also be some books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people. Everyone has their own views and ideas on everything. The people of @LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech, so it is true that every mouth has got something different to say. There are some books or movies that children cannot read or watch, but children still do because once the child is in the library, he can freely read, watch, or listen to anything. You can't depend solely on the librarian because there are other people in the library too. The librarian probably has other important things to do like carefully arranging the books, efficiently checking out the books, making library cards, or helping someone find a specific book. In my point of view, the library should have different sections for different kinds of movies, books, or magazines, and there should be a person assigned for every section. This way, children would not be able to go to the older people's section. If there are books that are found offensive by everyone, then people should write a formal letter to the president to help remove those books from the library. Yours @NUM2.
1134	4111	2	3	Have you ever been in that frustrating situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it? Are you extremely furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been eagerly waiting on for two months, and all of a sudden it's not available because of its content? I know I always am because at @ORGANIZATION1, this happens quite frequently. I firmly believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offensive. Sure, some novels @MONTH1 might expose a few words of profanity or discrimination, but everyone has to deal with such things in life. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vulgar because not everyone might dislike the book. If we took a book off the shelf every time someone reported a bad word or a discriminatory remark, then we would be left with no books, including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history. Some authors, movie directors, and artists rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, commentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything, there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 significant risk of losing a lot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As I'm sure you know, a lot of history books about the Holocaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 might find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those difficult situations were going through; therefore, those words shouldn't be reported for the sake of history. I know I'm not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, '... If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). In this quote, she is trying to say that if people abuse this policy, there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read because someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happen if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries in a reasonable way. Now, don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together because I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that uses profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning, then it shouldn't be available to the public through a library. Also, if there are inappropriate movies, I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public because that's what movie rental stores are for. On the other hand, I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being taken away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1', also known as self - opinions? In this writing, my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there are some offensive things that @MONTH1 might be happening, but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a valid reasoning, like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 might contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans, but a lot of it has a proper reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in inappropriate movies and songs with no historic purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?
1135	4112	2	3	I think that it should be left alone the way it is because it was put that way for a specific reason. They might not know the exact reason, so that's why I think it should remain as it is. The person who put it in that way might get really mad if you mess it up just because you don't like it the way it is, especially because it is offensive to some people. Another reason is that people are going to go home and watch it online or on TV, so how is it going to make a difference? It is not going to make one bit of difference at all. In conclusion, leaving things as they are is the most reasonable approach as trying to change it won't achieve the desired outcome and may cause unnecessary conflict.
1136	4113	2	3	No, I firmly believe that all materials should be placed on the shelves at libraries. We must recognize that some people have an affinity for things that others might find offensive. But as parents, it is your responsibility to oversee what your kids are reading. If you come across something offensive, simply tell them to pick out a new book, a new DVD, a new movie, or a new magazine. If you fail to do so, it's not the library's or the material's fault; it's your fault.   Some individuals are drawn to content from another culture or perhaps something related to a different religion. These are things that not everyone may appreciate, but that's the beauty of choice. We have the freedom to select whatever we want to read. If you don't like a particular item, just find something else. After all, some people find such content incredibly interesting. It's a fact that not everyone has the same views on things.  If there are books meant only for adults, put them in another room where minors can't access. Make it so that you have to show an ID that clearly states you are 18 or older to enter. This way, adults can look at inappropriate books without having to worry about kids seeing them. When it comes to checking out these materials, if you're under the age of 18, a parent or guardian has to be with you if you want to borrow them. Similarly, if it's a CD or a musician that has cussing in their work, you need to be 18 or older or have a parent check it out for you. This is because some parents don't want their kids listening to bad music.   As I've said before, I believe that they shouldn't remove stuff from the shelves just because a few or some people find it inappropriate. A few of us might find it fascinating to learn that the world isn't all the same. People are diverse and like different things, and libraries should reflect that diversity.
1137	4114	2	3	Everyone in the world holds different opinions. Some individuals deeply care about matters that others couldn't care less about. One topic that always stirs up a lot of discussion is censorship. Everyone has a stance on it, and it's inevitable that not everyone will agree with each other.   All libraries are divided into different sections according to age. There are dedicated children's sections, teen sections, and adult sections. I firmly believe that censorship is closely related to maturity levels. Materials in books and movies that are inappropriate for children should never be placed in the children's section. I understand that parents are concerned about their children being exposed to obscene material. However, as kids grow up, they're bound to learn about inappropriate things sooner or later, especially in school.   I don't think any item should be removed from the shelf just because a small number of parents find the material offensive. I don't take censorship very seriously. Some parents actually want their children to read books with inappropriate material so that they can gain a better understanding of what goes on in the world and what life is really like. Many children and some teens are sheltered and don't have much exposure to the real world. They lack knowledge that they should have at their age. Reading is an excellent way to learn. When someone wants to know more about any place or thing, they often go to the library and check out a book, whether it's for a school project or just for fun.   Most parents agree that nothing inappropriate should be in the children's section of a library. They're worried that their young kids might start using bad language at a young age. But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch inappropriate material, such as a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes. Parents shouldn't interfere with what goes on or off the shelves in a library. They should focus on their own children. If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive, they can simply tell them not to get the book. It's that straightforward. Parents who demand that books be removed from the shelf are asking for too much.   Censorship in libraries isn't a major issue for me. I think kids should have the freedom to read the books they want. At least they're showing an interest in reading. Let them explore the world through books. As I've mentioned, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and we should respect the diversity of views on this matter.
1138	4115	2	3	"I am writing this essay to you to clearly state my stance. Offensive books, music, movies, magazines, and other such materials should not be on our library shelves. The reason is simple: if our kids pick them up, it could lead to conflicts and even crime. Some people might wonder how I came to this conclusion. Well, imagine this scenario: you see a CD cassette that says ""Black Man's Only CD"". If a white boy picks it up and a black kid notices it in the white boy's hand, the black kid might try to rip it out of his hand, which could easily start a fight.   This kind of situation is not just a one - off. There are many other offensive materials that could cause similar problems. For example, a magazine with extremely controversial and offensive content could spark arguments among different groups of people. These materials can create a tense and uncomfortable environment in the library, which is supposed to be a place of learning and peace.   In conclusion, keeping offensive materials off library shelves is crucial to maintaining a safe and harmonious environment for everyone, especially our children. By doing so, we can prevent unnecessary conflicts and ensure that the library remains a positive space for all."
1139	4116	2	3	What should and shouldn't be censored in a library truly boils down to the opinions of the people who use the library. If everyone were to remove what they didn't like from the library shelves, a vast amount of valuable information would become less accessible to the general public. Although some individuals may be offended by certain forms of literature, this doesn't justify removing that literature from everyone's reach. I firmly believe that a solution must be found to satisfy everyone's concerns.   Currently, there are people who are unhappy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines available in many libraries. They think that the information in these materials might be unsuitable for some viewers. Some people are particularly worried about certain information getting into the minds of children.   While this is a valid reason to consider censoring library materials, there are others who oppose the idea of censoring libraries. Allowing censorship would reduce the amount of information available to the public. If parents let their children borrow certain materials without first checking the content, they have only themselves to blame.   I believe that this issue can be resolved by having parents fill out a form before their children get a library card. This form would list the things they want to prevent their kids from checking out, such as swearing in books and music, and nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be linked to the serial number of the library card. If a child tries to borrow something that is on the restricted list, the librarian would tell them to put the item back and choose another one.   I understand that censorship can be useful and important in some cases. However, sometimes it can be taken too far. There is definitely a solution out there, and we just need to put in the effort to find it. By working together, we can strike a balance between protecting children and ensuring that the public has access to a wide range of information.
1140	4117	2	3	In the library, I've noticed that there are several literature materials that aren't suitable for a younger age group. For instance, there are rated R movies that contain elements like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have a movie collection, and the ones that do have strict rules. They don't allow anyone under the age of 18 to rent out a rated R movie. Another example is magazines that have articles, advertisements, and pictures with a strong sexual undertone. This can be a problem for children because they might start to think that's how they should look and act when they grow up.   Most libraries are well - organized into different sections. There are sections for adults, teens, and children. These sections were created for a good reason. They are meant to indicate that some materials in a particular section may not be suitable for teens and children. If you're in the children's section, you can be pretty sure that not many people over the age of 12 will be browsing around. In the children's section, libraries usually decorate it to be bright and colorful, which most kids love. This helps keep the children in the area and stops them from wandering into the adult or teen sections.   When I was young, I had no interest in going into the adult or teen sections. I was content reading classic children's books like 'The Cat in the Hat', 'Charlotte's Web', and many other wonderful children's stories. There are plenty of things to keep children entertained at the library. They have children's movies and shows like 'Dora the Explorer'. There's an endless supply of books that can keep them occupied. If movies and books aren't their thing, some libraries also have a few toys for them to play with.   The main problem with having inappropriate materials in the library is that younger teens might accidentally wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult - oriented items in the young adult section. The same goes for movies. There are TV shows at the library that depict teens doing drugs, going to parties, and getting drunk. Such content can have a negative influence on younger teens, making them think that it's okay to engage in these behaviors and that it will make them popular and cool.   Overall, I think libraries need to re - organize their books, movies, and magazines. By doing so, all the appropriate items will be in the right sections, and there won't be any situations where someone accidentally picks up something inappropriate for their age. In my opinion, the music in the library isn't much of an issue. Music is a form of self - expression. This is my perspective on censorship in libraries, and I hope libraries can take steps to improve the situation for everyone.
1141	4118	2	3	@CAPS6 there are many books out @CAPS6 that, if looked into closely, have something obscene or vulgar in them. Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things, the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries. Authors write or type every word for a specific reason, whether it's a happy, sad, or vulgar one. @CAPS6 there is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive' things. Everything you read in a book is @CAPS6 because the author deliberately wanted you to read it, not just to put it @CAPS6 to fill in space or to be nasty. I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean taking the books down. The library where I live has well - defined sections for children, teens, and adults so that @CAPS6 there is no confusion or concern regarding the content of the book. You have to be of a certain age in order to take some of the readings home. I personally think that this is a great idea and will compromise both sides: those who don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything. If the latter was taken into effect though, some of the classic and prize - winning books would be taken off the shelves, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, The @PERSON1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4's @CAPS5, and much more. Such harsh actions aren't necessary when a much simpler and more effective way can be accomplished. Although offensive material is a concern for children @CAPS6 there are much better ways to ensure they can't read them until they're ready. No book should be taken off a shelf for its content as it restricts the freedom of access to knowledge and diverse ideas.
1142	4119	2	3	I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because someone @MONTH1 finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people subjectively think they are. I feel this way because no one is forcing anyone to watch or read anything they don't want to. No one is dictating to students what they can and can't watch or read. Everyone has the freedom of choice to choose what they want to read or watch. What one person @MONTH1 finds offensive and wrong, another person @MONTH1 may find interesting and exciting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no reason to take it off the shelf. The next person after me has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have and to like or hate whatever is on the shelves. There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive, there are also various genres. For example, there are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @CAPS3, an @ORGANIZATION2 best - selling author, @PERSON2. There are mystery books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1' by @CAPS3, another @ORGANIZATION2 best - selling author, @PERSON1. So, to sum up my essay, nothing should be taken off @CAPS5 shelves just because I or anyone else finds them offensive as it undermines the principle of freedom of access to diverse cultural and informational resources.
1143	4120	2	3	I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be available to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes, there are some very offensive items in a library, such as a book about racism towards African Americans. No, the person who takes offense in those items does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and every person. Let's suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As you're looking for a book, the child reaches for the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf, and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right in front of your child. That's your own fault, not the library's. Although many times it's not the library's fault where certain books are placed, you should be more responsible and carefully check out the area in which you are looking. I think there should be a specially - designated select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area, they must show a membership - type of identification and sign a waiver clearly stating that the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offense to anybody in which the customer is around. And that is my view on this subject as it strikes a balance between access to information and protecting the sensibilities of different patrons.
1144	4121	2	3	Books being taken off the shelves? No way! The @CAPS1 is the ideal place to go if you want books, movies, music, etc., that fit what you like and want. Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else? No, because libraries are meant for everyone for a good reason. Everybody is different. Which means everyone comes to the @CAPS1 for different types of information. If the libraries took off all material that offended people, there would be hardly anything left. What offends someone @MONTH1 may not offend someone else. For example, the libraries have in - depth information on the @ORGANIZATION1 history. While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learning about it, the information is also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 who it talks about. But really if you think about it, it's all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about. It would be preventing the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to. When people go to the @CAPS1 they know, no matter what information they're looking for, they will find it. Isn't that what's so great about trips to the @CAPS1? Looking and finding things you never learned about, even if it offends others. All that matters is that your head is holding more knowledge about that certain subject. It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are meant for everyone to access a wide range of knowledge and perspectives.
1145	4122	2	3	Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have diverse thoughts on what's offensive and what isn't. For instance, some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inappropriate. If you were to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive, there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has their own opinion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but that's the parents' responsibility to decide, not everyone has the same view on the material. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves because of one person's opinion on it. Everyone has their own opinion; some people like what other people don't as everyone is different in their own way. Removing materials based on individual sensitivities restricts the availability of diverse content and goes against the principle of freedom of choice and access to a wide range of ideas.
1146	4123	2	3	I firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, etc., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem. A person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they cannot just remove them. To remove books, music, movies, etc., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos. As Katherine Paterson stated, 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to choose books, music, movies, etc., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library, the statement would probably be true. Besides, the library is sectioned off into different genres. So, if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., simply skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer. In other words, the things that may offend one person may not offend another person. So, to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject. So, instead of there being a problem with one person, there would be a problem with two unsatisfied people. Not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as separating the books for reasons like this. According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a section for children only. Therefore, worries of problems like this have already been solved. The books, music, movies, etc., in the children's section are age - appropriate for a child. Books, music, movies, etc., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults. In conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, etc., that are found offensive by others may not be found offensive by someone else. It is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, etc., on the shelves. If you are mature enough to understand that and overlook something that may offend you, you would not be so offended. Also, if the library is sectioned off into different genres, you can easily bypass a particular genre you wish to avoid. Problems can be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner, and the current library - sectioning system is a good way to handle such situations.
1147	4124	2	3	I don't think so because what if that is all the person likes to read. They could put all the books into different sections so that little kids won't be learning words they shouldn't know right now. For example, the librarian could clearly mark each section with age - appropriate labels. The librarian could also make it where you have to be a certain age to check out a book. They could implement an age - verification system at the checkout counter. There are a bunch of ways to organize them into sections like making a kids section, a teenager section, and even an adult section. Each section could have its own unique layout and atmosphere to attract the target age group. But I don't think they should take them out of the library for good because there are a lot of good books with some bad words in them. Just because there are some bad words in a book does not mean the book is bad. Many great literary works contain language that might be considered inappropriate for some, but they also offer valuable lessons and insights. In conclusion, proper organization and age - based access are better solutions than completely removing books from the library.
1148	4125	2	3	Keep it on the Shelf! What types of things do you go to the library for? Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regardless of the material. Books can be used for many things. Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropriate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages. Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or motivate you to get your day started. Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store. Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. Magazines are a great way to stay up - to - date with the latest fashions and great dessert recipes. Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world every day. Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. Without the magazines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world. You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. The library has educational movies for children that may not be available anywhere else. They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today. Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Without most of that, regardless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. All of these resources should stay on the shelves regardless of their material, as they contribute to the rich cultural and educational experience that libraries offer.
1149	4126	2	3	Can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored? Can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them? I think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt. To keep something as important as the written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind. Not only would this attempt be futile (for the people know ways to extract information), it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so. I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow. Not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to. For instance, parents can have open conversations with their children about appropriate content. If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent, which is to protect the child. Some may say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but I say that this is not so. I believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work. If every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensive to only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none. There has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally. The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will. People find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party. I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculus? Created and controlled by the government surrounding him. Made their slave through ignorance. If in a society I cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization. In short, I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents. If a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it may be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely NO right to say what I may or may not read! If this offends anyone, then I apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep. We should uphold the freedom of access to diverse ideas and let parents take on their proper role in guiding their children.
1150	4127	2	3	Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people? This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another. For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place. In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves. First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age. For example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anything to do with them. Although, for the younger people, that is what is new and 'cool' to do. I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids. We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part. I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today. For example, I have a strong sense of moral values and am less likely to be influenced by inappropriate content. Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beliefs. A big thing with this is race and culture. I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race. This is the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials. Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion. There are countless numbers of these materials just that I have seen and I am sure that there are many more. It may be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves, but we should at least make an effort. Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive. I have seen a countless number of movies and listened to a countless number of songs that were offensive. The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it. A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes. I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive. All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves. We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do. Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone. In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves to create a more positive and inclusive environment for all.
1151	4128	2	3	Have you ever come across offensive material inside a library? Well, some people have, and they think there should be some type of censorship in libraries to protect the offended people. I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express themselves through art, literature, and even music. After all, the freedom of speech is written in our rights. Many authors, artists, and musicians have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored, it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people, but it is their work, a form of self - expression. They do not publish their work to offend people; they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are. A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library. Over many years, most libraries have developed and arranged their media into a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This well - organized system separates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own distinct genres. For instance, if you are looking for a mystery book, you would find it neatly placed in the non - fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre, they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor. Everywhere we go, someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library, there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If that happened every time, there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library. In the end, a book is a book, music is music, and we are not going to create censors or take books off the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write, musicians play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything, it does not matter what is offensive to people; they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library.
1152	4129	2	3	'Everyone has @CAPS1 @CAPS2' It is true that everyone has their own @CAPS2 and their likes and dislikes. For example, when it comes to books, I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. It is true that finding an inappropriate book or an article can be disturbing to certain people, but it does not mean that everyone finds it offensive. Once, my @CAPS4 class was assigned to do a book project. The main purpose was to find a non - fiction book and create a detailed powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. One of my classmates read and had a brief presentation over a book that was about illegal drugs. I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alcohol', but I find these words to be obnoxious. While I found it disturbing and uncomfortable, others found it interesting. It was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me. Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. My friend, @LOCATION1, found it disturbing to look at some pictures because they showed blood. Strangely, I never thought blood as anything disturbing. While @PERSON1 found it disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because it was fascinating. I always thought how the human body works is incredible. What @PERSON1 did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wandered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. The book did not have any benefit to @LOCATION1, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper. I believe it is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. Every individual is different in their own way. As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about it. If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarantee that there would not be any material left on the shelves. I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource.
1153	4130	2	3	I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpful place. Who would want to sit back and watch a racist movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develop a lot of problems. Music can be straight offensive. If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is racist, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an impact on you. You may not realize that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a different race. If a person isn't racist and they see something that is, it could offend them. They may feel like they're 'cool'. They go out and say racist things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technically bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries. Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie. They may not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They may go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These movies can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it. In magazines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magazines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magazine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. It's normal for someone to be jealous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We may starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. In today's society, people strive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stare. We use the girls in the magazine to help us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magazines can be offensive. In today's society, music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realize that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just being a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self - harm. Depression and self - harm are a big thing in today's society. There is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut themselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries. We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is meant to be a good place. Anyone can go there. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of. In conclusion, by being more vigilant about what enters our libraries, we can create a safer and more positive environment for all users.
1154	4131	2	3	Would you censor the @CAPS1? I surely would not. The @CAPS1 is a very precious and religious part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousands of books, newspapers, articles, and media that play an important role in the history and the future of human beings. Common sense, or also referred to as common knowledge, is something that we don't pick up out of nowhere. We absorb it through the things we do, see, and read. An example is 'The @CAPS4 @CAPS5'. This is a book of a @CAPS5 that meets a young boy and the @CAPS5 is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy. Throughout the story, the @CAPS5 gives the boy its apples, its branches, and even its trunk. But the @CAPS5 is happy. At the very end of the story, the former young boy is now an old man that just wants a place to rest, so the @CAPS5 straightens up its stump and is just happy with giving the old man his happiness. Now would you censor that?! That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life. That giving someone else happiness is the true gift of life. Now religion is something that is censored a lot these days... Why?! The @CAPS1, for example, is just a book full of short stories that tie together. Individual stories are just little reminders of right and wrong, kindness and jealousy. It doesn't say if you have to follow every word and every sentence day and night. It's just helpful advice. And really, who has not asked someone else for advice? The censorship of religion on TV, in schools, and everywhere else is telling us we don't need religion for us to be productive and honest. Me, coming from a Roman Catholic and Christian background, have never really gone to church or read the @CAPS1, yet I'm well - informed about religion, thanks to a close friend. Censorship could also be good at its points though. For an example, blocking adult - type content from minors is helpful since little kids don't understand much of anything. They just go with the flow. Another example is censoring mail sent to different countries. This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war. So I will say that censorship can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad. Such as censoring religious content, or censoring classical books that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future. This stuff is something that should be passed down by ages and ages to come! In conclusion, we should find a balanced approach to censorship that respects the value of knowledge and freedom of expression.
1155	4132	2	3	Shut down libraries? Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnecessary attire, they could also contain potty - mouth language. The words could, and can, corrupt the minds of youngsters. All libraries put them there because of the needs of customers. The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me? They should create separate libraries for each type of reader. Still, they put all of these things in the same building. They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'. I think I'll write my own @CAPS1 series, thank you very much. However, because some have dull environments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down. Make use of that thought I just told you. I wonder if there are some books on endangered species of fish. But some kids' series are dying off because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories. If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life. What if a chick is cursing out loud in front of the baby. How about saying '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 that?..' or '@CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!'? Maybe THAT will give some education. However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young minds - maybe even before they learn good language. Those delinquents don't care about their minds at all. Your honor, I have my proof right here. I suggest re - educating those teenage delinquents
1156	4133	2	3	With the world having a rich and wide - ranging variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, it's quite evident that there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some individuals and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have specific purposes as to why they were created. This could be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People frequently use libraries as a reliable source to access these works. Many people visit libraries every day, either to conduct in - depth research or simply to gain knowledge for the sheer joy of it. My firm opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it precisely contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to freely find a book, CD, video, or magazine on any subject that piques their interest.   If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library left. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, a sentence, or a meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will come across will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain might also offend you if they use a certain language with a particular tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you might not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes for informing. You might think the author needed to address a certain point more thoroughly than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone.   I once was in a library and read a magazine that was talking negatively about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it as it allowed me to see a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public.   If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated 'Mature' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy.   With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you might like a book, I might find it offensive. Even though I might have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests them. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear. This is how a library serves a community, by providing a diverse range of materials for all to access.
1157	4134	2	3	As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is truly a wonderful and invaluable resource. Multiple varieties of books can be found at a local library, ranging from documentaries to science - fiction or just plain fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one can freely choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposes the view in one book and firmly believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the precious freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some might disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary measure that severely constricts the ability to gain knowledge.  In today's society, many people differ greatly in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is extremely hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people should be able to enjoy their differences, leisurely reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dislikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their personal preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it should be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.  Still, censoring age - specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inappropriate is an inexcusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's beliefs. Doing so will not only help libraries thrive but also contribute positively to society as a whole.
1158	4135	2	3	I believe that this idea is not a good idea because some of the students would really need that information to look up ideas that they would require to write about in a report or to write in a final exam. The reason the library is here is for the students to have and take advantage of it, to put in the time to look up what they need for their classes. Knowing me, I put in the time that I need to do my work in class so I know exactly what is needed in the report so I know I'm doing it right and not just making up something that I could just insert into the report.  I see that it is important to keep the materials in the library to have the convenience of having things that are needed to look up a celebrity that is important to keep in touch with. If you're writing in the newspaper, you are in need of the information that you can get your hands on to keep all the students informed about how their celebrity is living their life. If students are ready to graduate and they are needing to go online to look up the types of colleges that they could attend before leaving @ORGANIZATION1 so they could be prepared to be ready in the world they were set out to be living in to start a life and accomplish things that our parents didn't get to do.  The interest of the library is to inspire some of the readers in the class to go out and read books that can show the situation on how your health benefits are. For example, by looking in a cancer book for information on how the sun and going to the tanning bed can cause skin cancer and can hurt your skin just by making yourself look older by getting a tan.  I think the situation of the library is to be used for our education and our benefits to learn more from books. Reading is a lot more interesting than just watching a show or a rerun of a TV show or even movies that show all the action. You can get more details from a book than from a movie. In conclusion, libraries are essential for students' academic growth and personal development, and their rich resources should be preserved.
1159	4136	2	3	It really doesn't matter to me because I only go to the library to get a book when my teacher at school makes me. But a library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is divided up into sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If a person doesn't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library then they don't have to look at it, or check it out. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean someone else doesn't.  Libraries don't force people to look at or check out something they don't like. So why are people complaining about it? They are getting to checkout books, movies, and music for free, unless it becomes overdue. So people should stop complaining about what the library has on their shelves. After all, the library offers a diverse collection to meet different people's needs, and everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to engage with.
1160	4137	2	3	In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there consists of many libraries that are readily available to the public, brimming with an interminable amount of information. All of this information gives us numerous opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. But what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? What if some of this information changes the perspective of peoples' lives, and who people are? Libraries do contain offensive and provocative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful from the behavior standpoint of all human beings.  Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @LOCATION1 come from many different places, making the @LOCATION1 very diverse. One thing in a book might not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. Magazines, movies, books, etc. should be carefully examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain ages, whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgeable assistance to help people find what they are looking for.  Sections in libraries organize the library, providing an easier access to where things are located. In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's ages is that it separates the mature section from the immature section, as opposed to having both in one. Children normally have a separate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from.  An example of a bad situation would be if there was a book located in the children's section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. The children that looked at that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invincible, drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life - taking. This is common sense. Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well.  Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that there are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. Assistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it.  Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. Every time I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for. They warn me about offensive or provocative imagery and such and help me with utmost respect. Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgeable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc.  Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provocative. Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to read whatever they please. Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out of peoples' mouths is useful no matter how ridiculous it is. Even if it is the most ridiculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. This would be more on opinion - based writing. In factual writing, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.  In conclusion, a balanced approach between censorship and freedom of access is crucial in libraries. By having well - organized sections and knowledgeable assistance, libraries can serve the diverse needs of the community while safeguarding the well - being of all patrons, especially the younger ones.
1161	4138	2	3	What would you say if your local library was censored? Would you truly believe it would be justifiable to have a form of censorship at the library? Well, I am here to explain my beliefs on censorship in the library. My opinion is that there should indeed be some items being censored, but we definitely don't want to punish every patron just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. If I were an adult, I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc., but I also wouldn't want to block his entire access to knowledge and entertainment. There can be different levels of censorship on individual people too. An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship can be put on a child by noting it on his or her library card. The censorship would be a great way to assist parents in monitoring what their children are reading and watching. A good suggestion for this is what I just brought up, a personal censorship. This would prevent the child from reading overly graphic novels for their age and it would not offend the parents. Also, for the rated - X magazines, movies, etc., I believe they shouldn't be taken off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded. This can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area. The censorship on books can also be completely over - the - top. A lot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives; it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf. Just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too. You may please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action. Another point to get across is that the library is also censored a little bit too. The libraries are organized into sections by categories of books. Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for. Once you get into the actual novels it isn't much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. When you reach the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not. With all this being said, there really doesn't need to be much censorship in libraries. Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library.
1162	4139	2	3	Everywhere a person goes, whether it's to a bustling city street or a quiet rural town, there is always a media source. Media can range from daily newspapers that keep us informed about local and global events, to glossy magazines that offer a mix of fashion, entertainment, and lifestyle tips, to the radio that fills our cars and homes with music and news, and through the television that brings a wide variety of shows into our living rooms. Media is used to inform citizens of occurring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, language, and other elements that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive. In the United States, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this fundamental right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials. Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things. Censorship can include anything from explicit photos, to vulgar language, to controversial news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of a well - known leader in a foreign country, one has to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world - wide events. Censorship affects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the United States and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold.
1163	4140	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other things can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that damaged or outdated items should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't believe they should be removed from the shelf unless you're cleaning up. I'm a responsible teenager. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And every day my parents have chores for me to do around the house, like taking out the trash, doing the dishes, and making my bed, and I believe that those should be done first instead of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf is full of books and other things and it's something that would have to be done to maintain order. Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that has to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing. I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others. In conclusion, we should only remove items from the shelf when it is necessary for the proper upkeep of the collection, rather than making it a regular and unnecessary practice.
1164	4141	2	3	Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive? I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensive. However, if a library decides to remove every piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare. I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels with non - traditional storylines, pictures in magazines that challenge social norms, and song lyrics that express controversial ideas. I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offended a piece of literature or art has made them. But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone might find offensive, another person could find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others. Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right. There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library. Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone. I know that I've personally found some books on the horror genre to be disturbing because of how graphic they are. However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive. Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intended emotions, and make people think. You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you. With everything going on in our society and culture today, in the United States and around the world, someone is bound to be offended every day by something. Religious groups may be offended by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and political leaders may be offended by what journalists are writing about them. You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people. To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence. People are obviously getting offended by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it. The television shows are still being aired. Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offensive. If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left? My friends, the answer is nothing. A beautiful creation to you may bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots may teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life. I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it. As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them. In the end, libraries should focus on providing a diverse collection for all patrons to explore and learn from.
1165	4142	2	3	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offensive shouldn't be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves freely. I listen to music all the time as long as I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and I'm pretty sure that goes for a lot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying, like a song about heartbreak or social injustice. I don't really read a lot because I'm picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. A lot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life, whether it's a fantasy world filled with magic or a historical era full of adventure. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape. Movies are like books but you get a visual of what's going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is. So my conclusion is that everyone is different; they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesn't mean that someone else won't like it. Like I said, everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well? We should embrace this diversity of taste and allow for the free expression of ideas in all forms of media, without the unnecessary restriction of censorship.
1166	4143	2	3	As a teenager, I'm in the process of growing and trying to figure out my path in life. I'm constantly seeking ways to express my unique self. I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own distinct opinions on the music we listen to or the books we read. I do think that younger children, like middle - schoolers and preschoolers, should be protected from violent songs and movies. However, for high - schoolers and older individuals, it should be our personal choice. If libraries truly believe that a book or magazine is offensive, they shouldn't allow its publication in the first place. Not everyone will like every book or every type of music available. We should have the freedom to access the books we like from libraries. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries can remove books, music, etc., because they're considered offensive, there'll be nothing left for us to read or listen to. I firmly believe that high - schoolers and older people should be able to decide for themselves what books to read or music to listen to. If you don't like a certain type of music, simply don't listen to it. If you don't like the way a book is written, don't read it. No one is forcing you to consume something you don't want to. A book that might be offensive to some could be eye - opening to others. In books, we learn about war and things that I find gruesome and unnecessary, but these are often facts of life. The things we might find offensive in books usually mirror real - life events. I do believe that younger children should be shielded from offensive books and music because they're not mature enough to distinguish right from wrong and don't know how to handle violent information in books about war or music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are offensive to parents with younger children in the younger sections of libraries. This way, everyone can have access to the materials that suit their needs and maturity levels.
1167	4144	2	3	I firmly believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library. Libraries are established to provide people with a wide variety of media that they require. This action of censorship will bring about three significant issues: business loss, inconvenience, and a reduction in people's book selections. The first reason why libraries should not be censored is to prevent business loss. Just like any other industry, libraries rely on people using their multimedia materials, such as books, magazines, music, etc., to stay operational. Many people visit the library to access specific magazines, movies, and so on. Removing certain movies and/or magazines means losing certain customers. Moreover, the loss of business will lead to a decline in customers. If there are no customers to check out multimedia materials, the library will ultimately be forced to close down. No one wants their local library to shut its doors, so libraries should not be censored. Also, instead of having an entire library censored, parents should censor what children get from libraries. One effective way is to get local libraries to implement restrictions on the cards of young children. For example, if a thirteen - year - old child wants to check out a movie that is rated @CAPS1, they would not be allowed to. The restriction on their card could limit them to rated @CAPS2 or @NUM1 movies. Another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library. For instance, if a thirteen - year - old child wants to get @NUM1 movies, only allow them to get one at a time. This approach will reduce the risk of offending a parent or guardian. Finally, there would be nothing left in the libraries. One reason is that out of all the books in the library, it's highly likely that at least one person is offended by each one. Does this mean that every library should close its doors? No, of course not. It simply means that if something offends someone from their local library, they should stay away from it. Don't check out that book, movie, magazine, etc. A second reason is that if the material in a library is offensive to people's beliefs or religion, they can choose not to go to that library. Libraries offer a wealth of resources to help people enrich their knowledge about a certain belief, so they should not be censored. Sometimes what is considered offensive to one person is essential to another. In every book in every library, there's something that people might think should be censored. But they must understand that those same books can be extremely helpful. Those books can transform lives and improve people's understanding of various things. So, I will never support the idea of censoring libraries.
1168	4145	2	3	Freedom to choose is an inherent right that every person should possess, just like the freedom to decide what type of clothes to wear. Censorship in libraries should not be permitted because everyone should have the right to make their own choices. Additionally, there are alternative ways to prevent children from accessing inappropriate books without completely removing them from the library. Censorship in libraries should not occur because if someone is eighteen, they are considered grown adults and should have the right to choose what they want to watch. Parents can censor what books and movies their kids read and see. Moreover, there are offensive and inappropriate things on television that everyone can access if they choose to. First of all, if a person is eighteen, they should have the unrestricted right to read whatever books they choose because they are legally adults. Eighteen - year - olds can enter rated @CAPS1 movies, which are likely to be as intense as some books. In our society, adults have the freedom to do almost anything they choose. For example, adults can look up whatever they want on the internet, and people of all ages have this access. So, if they want to read a particular book, they can probably find it online even if it's not available in libraries. Therefore, with today's advanced technologies, censorship would be ineffective. Next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books without removing them from the shelves. For instance, if parents are concerned about their children reading inappropriate books, they should accompany their kids to the library and guide them on what they can and cannot read. If parents don't censor what their child reads, it might imply that they want the child to read whatever they choose. The decision about what book the child reads should be a matter between the parent and the child. Lastly, there are numerous things in the world that can be offensive to others besides a book. For example, people often offend each other with their words. We hear about fights because someone was offended by something another person said. Also, television is full of inappropriate shows. There are shows on television that deal with racism or body - shaming, which offend people daily. Therefore, we shouldn't remove books from the shelves just because there's a possibility of offending someone when people can be offended by so many other things in the world. In conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies in the library should not be taken off the shelves from the public just because they're not suitable for some children. Eighteen - year - olds are adults who should have the freedom to choose. Parents can monitor their children's reading choices. Since people are offended by many things other than books, we should not restrict access to library materials. If a person finds a movie or book offensive, they can simply avoid checking it out. Not everything in our lives needs to be controlled; people should respect the freedom of choice.
1169	4146	2	3	These days, libraries offer a wide range of media besides books. There are various types of music, movies, magazines, and many other resources that you can discover in libraries. The question is, do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I firmly believe they shouldn't be removed. Even if there is content that you don't want children to know about, they will learn about it someday. Once we start removing materials from the shelves, more and more information will be taken away. Eventually, there will be nothing left for the children. There is a vast amount of information in this world. Growing children learn all sorts of things from their parents, books, and other media. Parents want their children to learn as much as possible. However, there are certain things that parents don't want their children to be exposed to. We need to think about this: children will grow up and become adults, and they will inevitably learn about these things. What's the point of removing materials from the shelves? Does it really prevent children from learning about them? I don't think there is any real benefit to doing so. Katherine Paterson, a well - known author, said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' I wholeheartedly agree with Katherine. Once books or other media are removed for one reason, other things will be removed for different reasons. As she said, if we keep removing materials, there will be nothing left for the children. If there's nothing left for the children, what's the main purpose of having libraries? I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Children will learn and need to learn these things to become well - informed adults. Also, if we keep removing materials, there will be nothing left in the libraries for the children to explore and learn from. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their diverse collection of materials, allowing everyone to access the knowledge and entertainment they need while parents can guide their children's choices.
1170	4147	2	3	Should certain materials on shelves that are offensive be removed? I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are considered offensive to some people should not be removed from the shelves. These materials are perceived differently by all kinds of people. Offensive materials should not be taken off the shelves because what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. People have different perspectives and reactions to things. For example, a lady might find a particular book disturbing or offensive, while the man standing next to her could find that same book interesting and useful. Since no two people are exactly alike, not everyone will take offense to the same thing. I also believe that if someone doesn't like an object that offends them, they don't have to pay attention to it. They're not forced to buy, read, or watch what is causing offense. The material on the shelf is not put there intentionally to offend anyone; it's there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy themselves. Therefore, I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off the shelves. People have the right to access the things they enjoy. A material shouldn't be removed from a shelf just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own unique perspectives and opinions on things. In a diverse society, we should respect everyone's right to choose the materials that suit their interests and sensibilities, rather than imposing a one - size - fits - all censorship policy.
1171	4148	2	3	The thought that Katherine Paterson had in her quote is quite understandable. If we were to censor books, then there would be hardly anything worthwhile to read in libraries. If you really tried, in every single book you could find something potentially offensive. I somewhat agree with her; however, I do believe there should be clear - cut rules on where books are located. Books are meant to be read, and taking them away would be a disaster for every book - loving person in this world. There are some aspects about where the books are to be found in the library that are up for debate. Personally, I believe the children's books should be placed on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material. In doing this, you, for the most part, prevent the children from accidentally entering an area that is not age - appropriate. Teenage reading material should be separate from both children's books and adult reading material. In this way, they are not exposed to the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak. If this were done, parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being. They would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive. Books that some people find offensive should be carefully categorized, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. They should also be categorized as '@CAPS3', '@CAPS4', or 'Other'. In doing this, most of the situations where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening. Although there will be times where people will still find those books and might be offended, it is mandatory that we do our best to limit those instances. All necessary precautions should be taken. At the same time, we should not remove any books from the shelves just because they are offensive to some. In removing a book from a shelf, we would be eliminating a piece of @CAPS2 or even life - long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself. Books offer us as humans so much, from @CAPS2 to entertainment to even a form of comfort. Books are important to everyone whether they realize it or not. We have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race through books. I do support Katherine Paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the very purpose of having them around. At the same time, I believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something. Removing books would destroy countless years of @CAPS2, past thoughts, and past experiences. Books should never be removed from libraries just because they might be found inappropriate. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects both the freedom of reading and the concerns of different groups is essential for the proper functioning of libraries.
1172	4149	2	3	I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people gain a learning experience from, then what does that leave us with? Everybody in life should have their own choices; we shouldn't limit them. It's all about making choices in life. People should get the right to read the books, magazines, etc. they want, without people looking down on them or thinking the material they receive is unnatural. What one person might think is not a good read, the next person might think the total opposite. Music is a creative aspect in our world. Every person you meet is unique, so should music be. You can't have the same ideas when it comes to making your creative interpretations of the music in your community; it's not going to turn out the same as everyone else's. If that was the case, then the world would be an extremely boring place to live in. I think that every one has their own taste in music. If you're the right age and you're not hurting anybody, then what's the big problem with listening to the music that encourages you to become creative? There are a lot of movies that some parents might think are not good for their kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so overly worried about what our kids are watching and more about what they are doing. I think that every movie you watch has a secret point in it, in other words, the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be shown in a movie that's probably rated @CAPS2. I don't believe that we should be focused on the rating of the movie; we should be focused on the lesson the movie is teaching you. The children in the world are going to have to make their own choices and discover what they find interesting. Should we ban everything we think isn't suitable? We need to let the children grow on their own and also learn on their own. You can't make somebody listen, read, or watch what you want them to. In conclusion, we need to let not just kids but everyone have the choices they want. The world is changing every day, so we need to change our ideas with it to keep up with the evolving perspectives on media and learning.
1173	4150	2	3	When walking into the library, it's disheartening to see children finding books, movies, and magazines they should not look at. It can be truly offensive. I believe that it is not the authors' fault for the offensive language in their work. I can completely understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at. My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read, and if it is offensive to them, they should simply stop reading the book. I feel that the student or adult should have the common sense to know if it is harmful to the student or not. Censorship in the library should be about finding books that are suitable for everyone to read. I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can potentially be useful to someone. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be rather bad. I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if people need to use the information from the book. If it offends them, then they should not read the book and choose another one. Authors work extremely hard for writing their book and going through the publishing process. My opinion is a firm no because I feel they should not remove items off the shelves of the libraries just because the content of the item is not appropriate to someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now, I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries. In conclusion, a more inclusive approach that respects the diversity of reading materials and the rights of users is the way forward for libraries.
1174	4151	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive. Many kids today are involved in gang - related activities because they see parents, older siblings, or even friends engaged in such behavior, so they decide to do the same because they feel it's cool. Teens nowadays really don't seem to care about the movies or the music. Not all music or movies are offensive. So we can't blame the media for the kids' actions. We can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies and listen to uncut music. We choose that lifestyle for our children, so we can't really blame the music and the movies. The people who make their uncut music or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies don't really care who watches it or what effects it would have on children, and neither do some parents. They're just trying to make a living like everyone else. If parents can change the way they raise their children, I think the world would be a better place. Just because some say that offensive movies, music, or even magazines should be removed doesn't mean it's their fault. It's the parents' choice to say it's okay if their child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies. In conclusion, instead of focusing on removing offensive materials, we should focus on improving parenting and guiding children to make better choices.
1175	4152	2	3	I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. For one of the reasons, in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it clearly states that you have the freedom of speech. When you write a book or an article in a magazine, you are expressing your thoughts on whatever you want, and if it is placed on a shelf in the proper place, it should stay there. Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want. Also, in magazines today, there are many things that are offensive to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc. But they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf, I think you should ask other people what they think about that material because some people might like it. Also, if you keep taking all the books off the shelf, what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you, just put it back up on the shelf and act like you never picked it up. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of expression in written materials and not let the sensitivities of a few limit the access of many to a wide range of knowledge and stories.
1176	4153	2	3	I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people have diverse preferences. Someone might have a strong desire to get that particular book. I firmly believe it wouldn't be just to take it away. When I was in sixth grade, I was placed in a foster home that I utterly loathed. They strictly prohibited me from listening to the music I adored. They held the view that it was detrimental for kids to listen to such music. All they insisted I listen to was Christian music, which I simply didn't like at all. My old foster parents used to attempt to take away the things from me that they considered the 'devil' within me. They would make me read the Bible every single night. They tried to force religion down my throat. I think perhaps that is one significant reason I'm not religious. They wouldn't even let me listen to this one band because they had a song about a girl's husband having an affair on her. Everyone should have their own independent opinion and be capable of choosing what they like, what they listen to, or what they watch. When parents are overly strict, it usually makes the kids more inclined to do whatever they're told not to do. If you don't allow someone to watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might become extremely difficult for them to express themselves. They wouldn't be able to showcase what they truly like. They'd be doing something they don't even enjoy, and that's definitely not right. Everyone should have the freedom to express themselves and what they like.
1177	4154	2	3	One of the amendments in the Constitution of the United States is freedom of speech. This crucial amendment grants the freedom of speech to anyone who has something meaningful to say, as long as what they have to say doesn't infringe upon the rights of others. It has been a long time since the Constitution of the United States was signed, but even today, there are still lingering questions on the subject. Should people be allowed to censor books? This is a matter that has been hotly disputed throughout the long history of humans and has been a topic of great controversy for many years. Some assert that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive. However, if one were to take the time to carefully think about the issue, they would see that if everyone had the right to censor a book they despised, there would be no books left in the world. In a population that encompasses so many different cultures and ethnicities and reaches to almost every corner of the globe, writing a book that everyone could enjoy and not find offensive could be an almost impossible task. We in the United States live in a very diverse society, and literature has, over the decades and centuries, adapted to the different types of customs, cultures, and religions so that anyone can find a book that they enjoy. The way of life that one leads might be different from that of others, but one should respect and accept the different ways of living, just as literature has. It's like being in school; there have many times been that one student that the rest of the class sees as really different. Our teachers taught us to be kind and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same. Even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic, it will still remain a topic of much debate. This is because everyone is unique and has their own opinions. Some say it's a great idea, and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living. However, the issue will persist because, after all, we are all different and have our own viewpoints.
1178	4155	2	3	I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldn't get to read the books they truly want to. I'm really into reading World War II books, along with a wide selection of other genres. If they take those away just because they're considered offensive, I'd be left with nothing to read. If I find a book I think is offensive, I simply put it back on the shelf and don't pick it up. I believe they should assign age ratings to books, like stating this book is for ages 12 and above, and especially to movies and magazines. This is because kids don't need to read or see certain inappropriate things. Books and movies sometimes contain references to drugs, alcohol, and murder. I don't think music is a major concern because music, on its own, isn't very influential. But music videos are sometimes inappropriate. Movies sometimes go too far, and I wouldn't want my kids watching such movies. So, I wouldn't mind if they take those offensive movies off the shelves. I don't think books should be removed from the shelf because parents should be aware of what their kids are reading anyway. I would at least thoroughly check the book or magazine before getting it for my kids, and other parents should do the same. There will always be offensive books and movies, so it's the parents' responsibility to ensure their kids don't get hold of such kinds of books or magazines.
1179	4156	2	3	I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should remain actively available in public libraries or school libraries. They vividly show symbolic meaning to the ever - evolving world as we know it. People hold different beliefs about anything. I firmly believe that, no matter what you say, everybody still has a distinct opinion about anything and everything. So, it's fine to just keep believing what you want to believe, but don't spoil it for others. You've probably heard the saying, '' if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all.'' Well, they should remember that saying and adhere to it. In my years of being in school, nobody has ever protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone got to read what they liked as the library provided people with the material they wanted to read. Let's assume a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the Berlin Wall. If the library says they do not and will not carry such reading material about this important history, the person will be understandably angry. Even though they can find the book somewhere else, they should still be able to locate that book in that library. That is significant history in this world, and people should be aware of it. This situation is comparable to people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history that people risked their lives for to be recognized. This fully relates to the topic at hand. I sincerely hope that this essay will make the protesters think twice about the topic they're arguing about. That will be all.
1180	4157	2	3	I believe that libraries should not censor their literature. All of our media is like a vast and rich fountain of knowledge, eagerly waiting to be discovered. No one should have the authority to decide what is appropriate for the public to know. The right to determine what is and is not appropriate for us should not be in the hands of libraries. That right should firmly remain with every single individual, so they can make the decision about what's right for them. Over the last thousands and thousands of years, media has grown at an astonishing rate through various forms like books, music, movies, and magazines. With all this diverse media, we've learned numerous things that we still use today from past trials and failures. Media is something that's always present and serves as a constant reminder of our past mistakes, ensuring that they don't happen again. The amazing thing about all the media we have today is that we haven't even scratched the surface of what we can and will learn from it. Some of our media might not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still glean a great deal from it. It might upset some people, and if it does, then they should stay away from it. It's not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person might find immoral and wrong, someone else might be able to learn something valuable from it. If you're offended by some of the material, you should avoid it, not get rid of it for everyone. Our media is extremely powerful and should not be censored. Media has an unbelievable impact on the world, so we should not attempt to hide some of it. We've not even seen half of what media can achieve.
1181	4158	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, it should not be removed. Katherine says, ' I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' First of all, she can have the right to do that but there are people who have a say in this. There are people who can freely read, listen, watch, and see what they like. Definitely, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn't have positive things. Although, it might offend some people, they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it. Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this. Though, many people might go against it. One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see is because it's their own choice. We make our own decisions whether people like it or not. Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows. Some people do not like to be bored with the same thing. Katherine Paterson, the author, is right in some ways. She wouldn't want her children to see things that are inappropriate. I have a daughter and I wouldn't want her to see things that are abhorrent. The last reason would be that children should not be allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older. These things can influence children very intensely. Indeed, many people in this world are influenced by bad things. The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see. For example, there is a magazine full of negative words and full of horrid stuff. Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that? You should if you love your child even though it's your own choice. You would want the best for your child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate. In conclusion, this would be your choice. There will always be things in the world that you don't like. You cannot stop the terrible things from happening. In the libraries, there shouldn't be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing. Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right. Finally, from what you experienced, teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn't make the same mistake as you did.
1182	4159	2	3	I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text - form. Creativity is a large and essential part of life, and without it, we would all be the same. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter; there is a book that will interest you. It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who particularly like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves? Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone. In a world where diversity of thought is important, restricting access to books based on so - called offensive content goes against the very purpose of a library, which is to provide a wealth of knowledge and ideas to all.
1183	4160	2	3	Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive? In my opinion, I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being, say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was too expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropriate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section, that would be their fault if they saw something inappropriate, not the library's. If the case was that every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I believe that the libraries wouldn't have as many books in their buildings that grown - ups would like to read. Of course, I'm not trying to say that there should be extremely inappropriate books wandering around in the library that small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in. When I've gone to the libraries, I have found books that I have enjoyed reading, and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in it right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more, listened to more, or watched more. I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off, it's the person's personal problem, I think. For example, there is this book called '@CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs really bad and got pregnant at a young age. That book was one of the best - selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed, then it's their loss. I mean, if there were a book about how to murder somebody, then yeah, I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immediately. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up, so why worry about it. If there were ever to be that type of situation, then that would be bizarre. But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like that in time. So, in conclusion, that is my opinion on this matter, and libraries should maintain a balance between providing diverse content and ensuring the safety and appropriateness for all patrons.
1184	4161	2	3	Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. Books are written on various topics, from love to sci - fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we perceive as offensive, then the human race wouldn't read anymore. @PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics. Books should definitely not be censored at all. It hides the authors' thoughts, ideas, and meanings behind their writing. I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies that parents need to step in. Having a one - on - one talk about the book's context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books. Pre - @CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and mentally. Through those phases, kids learn from various sources, including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false. My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine; yes, the magazine is intended for adults, but I obtained the skill to read from it. A skill that will propel me into job opportunities and assist me in everyday life. In the end, it's important to recognize that while offensive material may seem unappealing, it can also contribute to personal growth and learning, and parents play a crucial role in guiding their children through such content.
1185	4162	2	3	Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times, the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts may be offensive to a select few in our society. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public. Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect society. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairy - land books, the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the'real world' and one of the greatest ways to obtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' society. Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one or a few people. However, history is an important factor in everyone's lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is a way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and mis - concepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.' As people develop their own opinions and views over time, they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights may be someone else's wrongs. What may be offensive to you may not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves, there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the world goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, and censorship destroys our ability to do so. Everyone is different. The world is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our society becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media, we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful society. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmful to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place where all information, regardless of its potential to offend, is accessible, as it is essential for the progress and development of our society.
1186	4163	2	3	There are books, music, movies, magazines, and other media that are not appropriate for children. Having them banned from library shelves shouldn't even be a question. If children shouldn't read, watch, or listen to certain content, then it's the parents' responsibility to make sure they don't. However, I don't think they should take those kinds of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown - ups? They're just going to take them down for the children but lose business from grown - ups and teens. That doesn't make any sense at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen to, and if they can't, then it's up to the parent or a grown - up around them to let them know what they can choose. A way to solve the problem can be to separate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. That would make everything a lot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and no one loses business. In this way, everyone's needs can be better met.
1187	4164	2	3	I go to the library every [specific day] of every week. Although I don't really read that much, I usually get movies or music. If I do get a book to read, it's usually a magazine or something for school. I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them, it doesn't mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book, just ignore it and go on; it's simple as that. For instance, if I found a book about [specific topic] or about the [specific person] father, I would not read it for myself but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's their choice to read it, not mine. It's like the radio now. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curse words. I don't think that they should do that because it messes up the song's lyrics and it is going against the artist's words. The artist sings the song but people change his or her words. To me, I don't think that's right. It's also like television now. You see the movie in theaters or on [specific platform] and they have bad language or bad scenes in them. When you watch that same movie on television, they take out about [specific number] minutes of the movie because of the bad scene or they cut out the language. To me, I think everything should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it, just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie; it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music, then just switch the radio station to another area on the radio. There's no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets anyway. I also think since we are having to pay so much taxes, I think we should get the privilege to come home and watch movies on television and relax without unnecessary censorship.
1188	4165	2	3	It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If [a person] is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. [A person] must learn in order to teach. [A person] must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden. Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time are all we have, and everyone must receive and give respect. If [a person] were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same - sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. A world history textbook may not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being misled, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help [a person] to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: [person 1], [person 2], [person 3]. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it. Everyone deserves to be heard. If [a person] were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well - fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material may be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all [a person] can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and the concept of respect, everyone must be heard. Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity, and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it, and thus move forward in a more informed way.
1189	4166	2	3	People will always take things offensively. It is a fact of life. No one will ever be completely satisfied no matter what. We cannot try to please everyone, and it will never happen. We have a freedom of speech, even if those words are offensive to others. Things on the internet are offensive, and no one can mandate how it is viewed either. The same should go for a library. I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate. Some of the things authors write can be either inappropriate or offensive. That is their freedom of speech. We cannot take that away from them, but there should be some censorship at least to the appearance of books. For music and movies, they usually have a warning label if it is not intended for younger kids. It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines. In order to see a rated, '[specific rating]', movie you have to be over [specific age] and for a good reason because of the mature content. The books being written now are more and more mature. But if we take on the custom of being of a certain age for books, we might invade the privacy of others. No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive. Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owned and therefore have no one owner. The city owns them. If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library, it is the city's decision. Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves. The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request. Taking books off the shelves, I believe, is taking away from the public's ability to read. If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian. The librarian may be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and appealing to their child, ensuring that both the freedom of access to knowledge and the protection of children are balanced.
1190	4167	2	3	There are a lot of things that people think about. Do we really think that things that are found offensive in the libraries should be taken down? I think that if there is something found offensive in a library, it should be taken down immediately. Libraries should be a place of comfort, a place to relax, a place to read and enjoy our books, not a place where if we find something disturbing or offensive, we shouldn't come there anymore. Some people might not care about the things they see, and some do. Therefore, if I see something that offends me and is disturbing to me, I will ask nicely if it could be removed from the list and book files. Now to sum it all up, if a book or whatever it may be offends you in the library, then I believe it should be removed from that library. If people find things less attractive and offensive, it will soon go around, and less people will come to that library. This is how I put it: make the library suitable for others, make them feel at home when they are reading their book, magazine, etc., not for you. It is how others think about what is out there in these libraries, not what you think. By maintaining a library environment that is free from offensive content, we can ensure that more people can enjoy and benefit from this public resource.
1191	4168	2	3	This is a very difficult topic to engage in an argument about. In my opinion, I firmly believe that there should be certain types of censorship in libraries. Eventually, everyone is going to be exposed to the kind of material present in some of these books and other media. This material should be allowed in public libraries and high - school libraries. But of course, you wouldn't want to see high - school level of maturity in an elementary library. High - school students are far more likely to be exposed to inappropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inappropriate language, then they should be allowed to make that choice. However, if there are young kids doing this, it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in their lives. It is even best if they aren't exposed to this at all. There are also certain books in this world that are inappropriate even for high - school students, and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure. Once they are old enough to make their own choices, then it is their decision on whether or not they want to look at those books. There are some things that can and can't be put out into libraries. Even you should be well - aware of what belongs or doesn't. So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines, but leave out the graphic material. Children don't need to see that kind of stuff. It is all your own choice of things you want to read. Just make the right choice, and understand what you're reading, watching, listening to, or being around, so as to ensure a healthy and proper development.
1192	4169	2	3	Teachers in schools make every effort to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their specific age group. Parents also take the initiative to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a means of keeping them innocent. At a certain point in a young adult's life, this feeling of censorship gradually wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they desire. This is the common scenario in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old - fashioned for today's society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be present in libraries. There will always be something that one person finds inappropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger, we would sometimes watch movies in the after - school program I attended. One movie, specifically [mention movie name], created conflict. While my mother was okay with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent's concern, all the kids in the program had to watch a different movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As [Name of person] said, eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be next to nothing left; people can find offensive elements in almost any material in this century. It is the nature of our culture. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so, and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine. In [Name of organization], censorship has almost never been a prominent issue. It is part of what makes this country great. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not the case in a lot of places, and we should value that as [Relevant group], not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public. There can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this country's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is ultimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read. Overall, the censorship issue is a bit of a grey area. In my opinion, our country is about freedom, and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can hold their own beliefs, but the issue will be hard to resolve. Everyone has a different view on something, which is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to respect and get along, maybe then can this problem be effectively solved.
1193	4170	2	3	Today's books in our libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about things that happen in history. However, other books are not, and some are more offensive than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs, etc. First, I don't want my children growing up thinking it's okay to steal, do drugs, or engage in any of that sort of behavior. I've seen books that have no real meaning and yet are in our libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, but I think otherwise. There are books that fourth - graders read that have bad words in them. Secondly, [Type of media] are fun to read, I know they are. You have to look at it this way: I'm of age to read those kinds of books, but letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it were up to me, I would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. But it's not up to me; it takes more than one person to do that. It wouldn't be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way I do. Next, it's okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to listen to, as long as it's okay to watch or listen to. I'm just saying what I think would be right. Not everyone thinks the same. People [Some action] their kids watch and listen to all kinds of music and movies. As long as it's okay with the parent, it should be okay. Lastly, let kids be kids. Let them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound foolish to the next person, but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day, you still get to teach them not to listen to or do that kind of stuff in the books, guiding them towards a more positive and appropriate path.
1194	4171	2	3	Today in our society, many things can be interpreted in many different ways. Many sayings, quotes, and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that are explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the real question is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion, offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children - especially teens - will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time. If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she might not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she might be able to take that privilege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive. Being a teenager myself, I have witnessed what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case, it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive could cause a big problem. When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example, a person could pick up a funny book that finds humor in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of foul language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material. These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unnecessary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privilege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this, it clearly shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else, and we should respect the diverse needs and rights of all library users.
1195	4172	2	3	The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been a topic of debate. Libraries are places where people can escape the norm and immerse themselves in the works of other authors and musicians. I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the power of music are very essential parts of our lives. Censoring these would only shield our lives and prevent younger generations from discovering the impact that words have on our emotions and actions on a daily basis. Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had over the years. I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive, it would only set a precedent for other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors hidden. Personally, I enjoy reading. I think that with every book I read, it opens the door to other beliefs and cultures that I would otherwise never learn about. Children need to be able to explore the world, to understand how other civilizations grow and function compared to how we in the [Location 1] function in our own increasingly judgmental world. The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been fortunate enough to experience it themselves. I have always had a deep passion for music. When I want to relax, music helps me to calm down and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't even be a consideration. Removing music from libraries is something that is extremely difficult for me to accept. Freedom of speech was once a cornerstone of our country. Now it seems as if everything we've been taught about our great [Location 2] has been nothing more than a false pretense to allow the government to control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. Music is a non - violent way to express oneself. During the sixties and seventies, music was the way a lot of people protested things like war and racism without resorting to violence. Times have changed, and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option. I believe that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, it doesn't mean that it actually is. We worry enough already about what other people think. Why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different? If we all embraced the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be displayed in our libraries, thus promoting a more inclusive and free - thinking environment.
1196	4173	2	3	Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them? Well, I can. Children today are unfortunately learning nothing but violence and cursing these days. Banned books could be the way we set them straight and make them recognize that such stuff is bad. Only a handful of kids these days are choosing to read books; a majority of them are engrossed in playing video games and watching TV. Children shouldn't be allowed to swear or think that violence is alright. Children will read these bad books and wrongly think it is okay to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like, but it's clearly not alright. Banned books are exactly what children need when they are in their younger years. Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is okay to let your teen or young adult read them if they are mature enough to handle it. Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it or someone killing another person. Some banned books don't even have swear words in them; '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books, yet still it remains on the banned books list to this day. Some books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed for profanity and drugs. I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list. Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing. In conclusion, I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderately. The children today don't need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc. I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about, and it will help guide children towards more appropriate content.
1197	4174	2	3	"I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed. There are practical ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be exposed to. If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material, that responsibility lies with you, not the libraries. We have libraries for the sole purpose of providing variety. What's the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone? There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf. If they are that explicit, then they can be put in a section just for adults. No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is that if you don't want your child to read or see certain things, that's fine. Then, simply watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch. Your child doesn't have to engage with anything if you don't want them to. It's like saying I don't like this television show and I never want my child to see it. Well, what are the odds that the television show is going to stop playing just because you're not happy with the violence, drug use, language, etc.? The odds are extremely unlikely. When you don't want your child to see that certain show, what do you do? You watch them and keep them from watching it. So, why should there be any difference when it comes to the books they are exposed to in a library? Another reason would be that the sole purpose of a library is to give variety to the people, a place where there is something for everyone. Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see it doesn't mean that someone else won't like it. It could be someone else's favorite book, magazine, CD, or movie. One opinion shouldn't count for so much. If you don't like a book, movie, magazine, CD, or agree with the content, fine. You're entitled to your own opinion, then don't check it out. No one is making you. If they took something off the shelf every time they got a complaint about it, there would be nothing left. If they were about to try and accommodate everyone, they might as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the shelves. Also, instead of taking them completely off the shelf if they are that explicit, maybe make an eighteen and older section. It would solve a lot of problems. Yes, I agree that there are a select few books, magazines, movies, etc. that younger people should not be subjected to, but as an adult, you should be able to read, watch, and hear whatever you want. That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries. Every library I have ever been to has certain sections. If your child stays in the section where their type of books are, then they should be fine. Aside from that, though, an eighteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict. No, I do not believe certain material should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive. There are far too many ways around having to take the books completely off the shelves. I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the shelf every time someone had a problem with it. There is absolutely no reason why we can't figure something out to make everyone happy, and I think that having the eighteen and older section would be a good start. For those who say, ""I don't want my child to be subjected to those kinds of things,"" then keep your child away from those kinds of things. Nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to, and by implementing such reasonable measures, libraries can continue to serve all patrons effectively."
1198	4175	2	3	Libraries. There are many libraries throughout the @LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with a wide range of materials such as books, magazines, music, and movies. Libraries do have a significant purpose. Having a library provides access to information that you can't easily find elsewhere. Just think, it's a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place. Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated @CAPS2, for instance, should be promptly placed elsewhere on the shelves. If you'd like to rent them, you should ask for assistance and then proceed from there. Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unnecessary information. In my own perspective, there should be an adult section, where only adults above a certain age should be allowed in or be able to check out. By keeping such materials shown or on display, it may cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions. As for music, it can go both ways. Music is more of a lifestyle for many people; some can't live without it. Adults in this day and age often say, 'need music to survive'. If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf, people may be turned away, and your library may lose business. What is a library if you don't have music, books, magazines, and movies? It's just an empty room. Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up or in their own area where not everyone is allowed. Taking away such materials may cause a lot of grief. Just reorganize and make the library's environment safe so that everyone is welcomed, and there will be no complications. By carefully managing the placement of different materials, libraries can ensure that they meet the needs of all patrons while also protecting the well - being of younger visitors.
1199	4176	2	3	Good? Bad? Offensive or not? These are just a few of the thought - provoking questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being? From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., the author(s) may express what they feel on a given topic. Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. In society, people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story. In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. The world will never be perfect! The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self - censor what they might ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. If one shows so much enmity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please and choose not to listen/read. At the bottom of numerous CDs, both explicit and non - explicit, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. It will briefly tell you that there is some content that may not be appropriate, that may hurt feelings, and simply offend. It is then that one can choose to listen to the CD or not. Every human is entitled to freedom of speech. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. There are words spoken that will offend many! From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger. People will always be offended. There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. Not everyone agrees with one another because everyone is unique in his own way. From ethnicity to personalities, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. We are all special, and we all think differently. We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others may not. @NUM1 years ago when I was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. Times were tough then, and there was still a lot of racism in @LOCATION2. As my teacher read us this book every day, we all sat and listened quietly. After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger - lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. In less than a minute, @NUM3 black children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class. The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way. Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally. I've begun to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves. That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were. Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that, I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves, as they contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of different aspects of life and history.
1200	4177	2	3	When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are multiple different aspects that must be carefully considered. There isn't a single, particular audience that visits a library. Many diverse types of people go to libraries looking for different things. Blocking types of materials will lose an audience's interest, and they will go elsewhere. Now, that doesn't mean that offensive materials are acceptable, and here's why. There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive. Profanity and mild action are minor types of offense. However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such need to have specific conditions. Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some @CAPS1 from viewing harmful materials. Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 is an effective way to restrict children. Adults would not want to go into this section, and therefore it wouldn't be an issue. It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone. If offensive items were available only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem. Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types. When it comes to books, they can be placed in areas available to people who enjoy them. The same applies for magazines and movies. Movies are a form of entertainment that is strongly advertised over magazines and books. Any advertisement that shows explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public. These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was intended for. If @CAPS1 wish to use computers, there are rules that need to be applied as well. @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material. @CAPS1 over the age of @NUM1 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk. These computers should be separated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to
1201	4178	2	3	I think that the music and other things besides books should stay in the library. Honestly, that's where a lot of people go and find new music. Yes, it could be offensive to some people, but to others, it's not. They have the right to say they don't want to listen to that stuff, so they simply don't have to. The library holds over a @NUM1 different kinds of music, movies, magazines, etc. So if there are over that many, then why should other people be limited to what they read, hear, and look at? The library is where people go to find new things and explore what other people find interesting. Why would they put it in there just to take it all away? I remember going to the library as a young child and looking around me. I saw all these other people looking at things I had never even heard of. Granted, I was only @NUM2, but my point is that people grow into what they like; they aren't just born liking something and that's it. I think the library is perfect just the way it is. I think that if anything, we should put more different kinds of music. I know not everybody likes the same music, so why would you want to force them to? I think that the @CAPS1.S is populating more and more every day, and all we can do is just extend it in every possible way. Keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books; they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting. I know I'm a person who would much rather watch a movie or listen to music than read a book. Not everybody is the same, so why would you want to treat them that way? Being @NUM3, and if I had to listen to Disney tracks all the time, I think I would drive myself crazy. I listen to the things I listen to because I have an interest in them. If somebody took away my music, I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I guess I would just have to read the books I don't like and listen to the music I can't stand. The music should stay in the libraries because that's where it belongs. You can't make everybody happy, but we should respect everyone's right to access diverse content.
1202	4179	2	3	In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be extremely offensive to others. They can be against some people's religion and way of life, causing discomfort and even harm. I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now, unfortunately, they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have explicit violence and highly inappropriate behavior described in them. Are these really the books you want your children to be reading? There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based on a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one at all. The series can contain intense violence that can strongly influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really cool on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble than they want to get into, such as getting involved in fights or other dangerous activities. I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch or read them. There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could have a negative influence on the rest of their lives? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do? It's important to make a responsible decision to protect the well - being of our children.
1203	4180	2	3	I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult, you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who, out of curiosity, look through that same section. Although their parents should be closely monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries to ensure they are exposed to appropriate content. Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the youngest readers. Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far in terms of themes like complex relationships, drug use, or extreme violence, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have unrestricted access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children than others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was little, my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place. As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much because as an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. You know what's right and what's wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading. The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point, children are at an awkward growing stage where they themselves are still learning what's right and wrong. Some books or movies could affect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching. I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take an active part in their child's life and set clear limits to what their child is allowed to view. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section to ensure a healthy and safe reading environment.
1204	4181	2	3	Yes, I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way. Librarians shouldn't have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should primarily have interesting books with good stories to read and kid - friendly books. There should be no sexual or racial books, movies, magazines, etc., as these can have a negative impact on the readers, especially children. Those things that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library, and they shouldn't be able to see those things or check them out. Their young minds are still developing, and exposure to such offensive content can be harmful. I do agree that libraries should have a wide range of different kinds of books, movies, etc., because everybody has their own taste in what they like. But the things that are offensive shouldn't be on the shelves. If libraries didn't have offensive things on the shelf, then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it wouldn't cause any problems with people because they wouldn't be on the shelf. So if they would just take those things off the shelf, then nobody would see them, and there would be no problems at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive things on the shelves, which would make it a much better place to enjoy. By creating a clean and appropriate environment, libraries can better serve the community and promote a love for reading and learning.
1205	4182	2	3	When you want to read that one special book you heard about but you find out it was considered offensive to some, what would you do? The public libraries will take all offensive material off shelves for no one to read. Then that one special book you wanted to read is now off - limits. A book that someone worked hard on, or a song or movie, is now stored away because of a little controversy. Do you find that to be fair to our rights? I find the fact of censorship a very confusing topic in public libraries. If someone is to write and publish a book, then there will surely be someone who wants to read it. If some find it offensive, then no one can read it. How is that fair to the people who do enjoy it? The way it should be done is if you don't like it, don't read it. Don't just take it away from all who would want to read it. There are some materials in libraries that I think should be censored to a certain degree. Such as anything with nudity or adult content. That does not mean, though, it should be taken away. The stuff with this content should not be taken away but placed in a selected area for only adults to view. Many movie stores and book stores have the same idea, so why doesn't the library just adopt that idea? We as @CAPS1 have the right to freely state our opinions and what we believe. If someone wants to write a book on what they think is right, then they are allowed to do that. If you censor something just because you don't like what they say, that is a violation of the constitution. You are allowed to express your opinion about it, but taking it away because you @MONTH1 not like it is wrong to do. Do you find it fair that people spend so much money and time in writing a book, and a few people find it offensive, so no one can view it anymore? I say if someone spends their time and effort, then it should be allowed for those who do enjoy it. Is it really so hard for you not to pick up a book that you @MONTH1 find offensive? Censorship is good in some cases, but enforcing it too much on what someone calls offensive is against our right to freedom of expression. We need to strike a balance between protecting the sensibilities of some and respecting the rights of others to access diverse content.
1206	4183	2	3	Should offensive material be censored? Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. For instance, a young child might not be ready to encounter explicit violence or strong language in a book. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world completely. Protecting your children from things that offend you might stop them from growing up badly, but it also limits their exposure to different ideas. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. Censoring or removing things that you find offensive might be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone might want to do this. A parent might not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents might want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents might feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also might feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly. Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freedom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it's just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents might think that this is a good idea because it protects their children from things that might be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, etc., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, etc., have already been bought and sold for years. I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people might like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegally downloaded, or bought music that uses inappropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, MP3 players, and burned onto CDs, there's no removing it. Books that some might find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person might lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out? In conclusion, while the intention behind censorship may be well - meaning, it ultimately restricts freedom of choice and does little to eliminate offensive material that already exists.
1207	4184	2	3	The many books, movies, music, and magazines in the world could be offensive. In all of these examples there could be bad language, inappropriate pictures, and offensive messages. No matter where people go, whether it's a local bookstore, a movie theater, or an online music platform, they can find something that could offend someone. No matter what, people will try and get rid of everything bad but the truth is they are gonna be around forever if not a very long time. In CAPS1 CAPS2, all the students in grade ten just got done reading 'CAPS3 of CAPS4 CAPS5.' The story is about a runaway NUM1er named CAPS6; and a runaway boy named CAPS7. Many libraries have banned this book because of the use of the n - word. 'CAPS3 of CAPS4 CAPS5' has profanity in it, and people don't want that book to be taught in CAPS2. I personally think it should be taught, because it shows students today what it was like back when there was slavery. By reading this book, students can gain a better understanding of the historical context and the social issues of that time. Music is something that mostly everyone listens to. Songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about. Many song artists write about love, money, and fame, yet others write about drugs, profanity, and suicide. Hip - hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, r&b, punk, etc., are only a few of the hundreds of types of music out there; and at least NUM2 songs of each type have a bad meaning behind it. Magazines and movies are the same way. Magazines and movies have everything between cars to bad pictures in them and historical places, facts, and documents to action. Even though there are age limits to buy or see stuff it still doesn't mean that it couldn't get into a teen's hands. For example, a teen might borrow a restricted - age magazine from an older friend. Because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., doesn't mean it should be banned, just limited. No, it is not wrong to put what you feel into a book or into a movie just make sure it is analyzed right so it can only be checked out or sold to the people of the right age. What the children and teens are into now will affect the world in a later time and keep on going until there is a change made. In conclusion, rather than an outright ban, proper age - based restrictions and analysis of media content can help manage the impact of offensive material on different age groups.
1208	4185	2	3	We live in a world DATE1 inundated and persuaded by media. Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present. Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media. For example, a historical book can shape our understanding of past events, and a popular song can influence our mood. The art world is considered to be one of the most controversial businesses to work in. Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics. We all are given the right to our opinion on such pieces. Every piece of art is judged and then criticized. However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form. It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction. For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their non - factual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter. Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience. Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience. Why not learn from them and reflect? For instance, a movie about a particular culture might be misinterpreted by some viewers who are not familiar with that culture. No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world. As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized. The men and women who fought for our country might enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers might see this as an insult to their cause. PERSON1 wrote a book by the name CAPS1 NUM1. This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship. The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of people's opinions. If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books. History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending. Non - religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the CAPS2 and other works of religion. Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent. PERSON1 denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson. For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity. Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor. Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together. We can not escape the diversity in which we live in. The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generation's history and the next. We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal. If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left with nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history. We have to accept others' ideas and build on them to improve our life and others'. As we stand DATE1 in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect. It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on. In conclusion, embracing diversity and learning from different forms of media, even those that may be controversial, is essential for our growth and the progress of society.
1209	4186	2	3	I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries. I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming. For example, I came across a magazine with extremely graphic and offensive images. I think it should be censored and taken off the shelf. If you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf. You should not want customers reading it and feeling disgusted. I hope something I write will propose my reasons. I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taken off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that was offensive. I believe things in this nature should be handled with great authority. If anything I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens. By removing offensive materials, we can create a more comfortable and appropriate environment in the library. Just think if a visitor comes in and picks up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, and it is getting talked down about instead of being looked at, then they would be very offended. For them to come there it had to be a reason that they came, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted. It is very inappropriate to have things that are offensive in the library. A library should be a place where people can feel safe and respected while they are learning and relaxing. It is plenty of different reasons people come to libraries. Some come to get away, and to others it's a daily routine. Whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable in the place they are at. Why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at. Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will lose a lot of fellow friends and a lot of business. Think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach things to get people's attention. To answer the question CAPS1, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves. I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people. If people would not judge or insult people then the world would be a lot safer. It has to start somewhere, every little start causes for a great ending. I think this would be a good start on making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together. I hope something I wrote will help you on your decision. In conclusion, censoring offensive materials in libraries is a step towards creating a more inclusive and pleasant environment for all library - goers.
1210	4187	2	3	CENSORSHIP CAPS1: CAPS2 paper Do I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My opinion is that if someone wants to write a magazine or a book it is okay because they are giving their opinion. Some people just have to say what they believe and some fight for what they want. Not just censorship has its fight, everyone has one. For example, an author might write a controversial book to express a particular social or political view. Some materials like music, movies, and magazines need to be censored because there are kids in the libraries, kids who are in NUM1 NUM2 grade or maybe smaller than that. We need to clean the libraries from things the kids are not old enough to see or to hear. Libraries are a place to study and to read a good book or maybe a magazine. We have to censor the bad language and the bad pictures. This can be very offensive for some parents because they might talk about the color of another person or use bad language to offend the government. For instance, a magazine with inappropriate racial slurs or political insults could be harmful to young minds. People don't have the attitude to stop with this bad songs that contain censorship. See, some people who write this say the people don't have the attitude to be or say what they want. I think we need people like that to just point fingers and say that's the bad guy, but answer this: what good have you done to clean the libraries? By taking action against offensive materials, we can make
1211	4188	2	3	I do believe that certain materials should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive. I firmly think children should only be able to read certain books because some books contain content that they shouldn't know until they get older. Some books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed if they are offensive. I really believe they shouldn't create some kids' movies, books, and music like that for little kids. They put far too many inappropriate things in kids' movies. For instance, the movie the @CAPS1, they should not let kids watch that movie. It's not a movie I would let my kids see until they were older. The reason is that it has a lot of bad language in it. It is about these guys who take ruphies. This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that I would let my kids watch. There are people getting drunk in the movie, and they do stupid things. They try to make it look like it's a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things. I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch. Some music has too much bad language in it. I think they should make better songs for kids. Songs that really mean something or are about someone. Most of these songs they sing now are about dumb things that do not mean anything. I think some magazines are okay to read, but some just talk about actors. Like @PERSON1, I read one time about her doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it. I believe that if they are offensive, they should be taken off the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things, kids should be able to see them or read them. If they did that, kids would not talk and do things like they do today. That kids would not try to steal and do things like they do in these movies they see it happen or their friends do it. So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that, but it is not. In conclusion, removing offensive materials is crucial for protecting children from inappropriate content and promoting positive behavior.
1212	4189	2	3	Offensive material like that should most definitely be removed from the shelf. What if a child finds it? They might think it's the coolest thing they've ever seen. Children shouldn't be able to access this kind of material at all, especially from a place like a library. Somebody could easily pick it off the shelf not knowing what it is. They might start reading it and not know what they're getting into, but it would be their fault for picking it off the shelves. This kind of material should only be placed where it is welcome, not in libraries or public places like that. If the material was at a type of book store that was not meant for people under @NUM1 to go to, then yeah, it is meant to be on the shelf because children aren't allowed in that building. Therefore, they cannot see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or something. Depending on where you go, if that material is on the shelf, say at a place that is not so public, and you pick it up and start reading or watching it, you have yourself to blame for not researching the book or the case of the material. If people want to get it, they can, but it would be at their own risk. Therefore, if the consumer takes it off the shelf, it's their risk of being offended. Therefore, they cannot blame the place the material was at. In conclusion, offensive materials should be restricted to appropriate places to avoid children's access and to ensure that consumers take responsibility for their choices.
1213	4190	2	3	@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now. The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the world's libraries today. In this context, hopefully, I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?' and '@CAPS1 now?'. Censorship, what does that mean to you? To me, that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inappropriate things. In today's libraries, there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries. Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong. Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us. In today's world, many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us? In the world today, there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights. Many want to protect their youth from some of the so - called 'harmful' things in society. Today you can try to create a law or bill that might make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material. @CAPS1 now? Through the years, the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to. Now one thing they think they might be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, but it will not happen. There is an adult section for adults, not children, people need to realize that. In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war and recessions. When people are of age, they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger. Don't punish the rest of the world for one library's mistake of letting children have access to adult material. Make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in. Then many parents might see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are. In conclusion, maintaining the adult section in libraries is essential for respecting the rights of adults and providing appropriate access to different types of materials.
1214	4191	2	3	I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelves. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it. Censorship is kind of out of the way. I think it really doesn't matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it, I think they have the right to because it is their own choice. I have been observing students and adults in the libraries and everywhere. They seem to think they can run everything, but this is what I think is right. Everyone has different levels of tolerance and understanding, and by keeping all materials available, we allow individuals to make their own informed decisions. Censorship can limit the exploration of diverse ideas and knowledge. In conclusion, leaving books and other materials on the shelves respects the freedom of choice and the right to access information for all.
1215	4192	2	3	I believe books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be removed from the library if they are offensive. Some people take things wrong, and libraries could have issues. Also, it keeps customers happy and it will get you more guests daily. Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves. First, some people will take things wrong, and libraries will have issues. If someone comes into the library and feels there is something in the library that is offensive, you can get a lawsuit. Also, it could set off anyone's mind to feel disrespected and feel they don't have to respect the library because the library isn't respecting them. It can cause pain in someone's eyes by making them feel like they aren't equal around other people. Second, it keeps customers happy. If a customer feels that they see something offensive and the library discards of the object, it will make them feel that you respect them. If you keep offensive things in a library, less people will come to the library if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed. The more people feel at home, the more they will come. Next, it might let someone feel better. If you walked into the library and saw something you didn't like in there, you would want it removed too. If it didn't get removed, you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted. Let's say someone sees something offensive and the library doesn't remove it, and the person took a book out of the library, then never returned it. You would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock. In conclusion, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issues without conflict. You can disrespect someone, and they might disrespect you back, but when it all comes down to it, you have to give respect to get it. Some things help people feel better about themselves and keep their day going. So before you make your decision, think would you want it done to you. By removing offensive materials, libraries can create a more positive and inclusive environment for all users.
1216	4193	2	3	Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not. In this country, surprisingly, there still is such a thing called freedom of speech. Just because some people, say in a particular month like @MONTH1, find something offensive does not mean that the so - called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody. Think of some well - known authors that wrote books like @PERSON1. Although there were a lot of racist remarks in the literature of that time period, that does not mean that they still are not a part of American history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absolutely nothing. Racist people aren't going to go, “Hey, since all these racist books are gone, I'm just going to accept everyone now.” Music and movies are forms of expression as well. And if someone wants to get out of hand and write something offensive, so be it. You do not have to listen to the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature. People just take everything so literally these days. They feel they've got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should really realize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. They should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news. In a free society, we should respect the diversity of expression and let individuals make their own choices.
1217	4194	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in today's society. It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about. I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional @CAPS5, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1 clearly @LOCATION1 the idea of freedom of the press. Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5. I firmly refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the @CAPS3, and the people of the @LOCATION1 should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion. When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed. For instance, what is offensive in one book @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is a relative one, in that the definition varies from person to person. No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population, and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer. This would be extremely problematic for those trying to censor items within a library. Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much controversy as the books themselves. Knowing that every person carries a different opinion, the people deciding would have to equally represent every person's opinion when making a decision. That's a huge challenge. Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in @PERSON1's '@CAPS7 @PERSON2', the 'n' word appears over one hundred times. Many @CAPS8 @CAPS9 take great offense at the use of this word. However, this book is seen as one of the century's greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population. In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible but utterly unconstitutional. The idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued as it goes against the principles of freedom and knowledge.
1218	4195	2	3	There are many forms of entertainment in the world today. Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television, and radio. While these examples, at first glance, @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive. When the book, magazine, or movie was created, it @MONTH1 not have been made to be offensive. A particular group of people, perhaps in a certain situation, @MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about. There are many types of consumers, and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive. The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon. No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie, or listen to music. If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it. Others, on the contrary, @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong. There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people. To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large and nearly impossible task. Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries. If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book. The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it. Everyone has a different view on things. Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely differently. This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio, and music could be offensive to people. For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on. This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy. If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it. Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone. In a free and diverse society, we should respect the right of individuals to choose their own entertainment and not let the sensitivities of a few limit the choices of many.
1219	4196	2	3	Living in today's society, there are many different people and many different outlooks on things. The world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions. There are an uncountable number of different ways people look at the world and ways that people perceive things. To tell someone what they should and should not know is simple - minded in the aspect that anyone can perceive a book, music, movie, or magazine differently. @CAPS3 quote by Katherine Paterson, in short, metaphorically uses a book and a shelf to let the reader comprehend the importance of information that is passed down from generation to generation. The book represents the information in the world, and the shelf stands for the place the information is stored for one to go seek information. To remove the book off the shelf indefinitely is to close the mind of a future generation. It was once said, 'You can not know your present without knowing your future.' @CAPS1 the book @MONTH1 offend one reader; it could also inspire another as well. Everyone has a different opinion and lifestyle. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people are granted with better lifestyles than others, @CAPS2 are unfortunately living every day in struggle. One book that @MONTH1 offend a person who thinks the book is harsh and should be taken off the shelf could also inspire a young child going through struggles to overcome their surroundings and be a better person. I have read many books that did not interest me and passed them on to my siblings and friends. Shockingly, the book interested them. After interviewing my siblings and friends over the book, it turns out that they got a different message from the book than I did. No one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time. '@CAPS2 @MONTH1 argue that the glass is half - empty while others argue it is half - full.' @CAPS3 quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today. Ultimately, if everyone thought the same, then everyone would be the same person. To 'leave no books left on the shelf for any of us' is like programming a robot to only do what you say. In such a diverse community, it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf. We should embrace the diversity of ideas and let books, as carriers of knowledge and inspiration, remain accessible to all.
1220	4197	2	3	Opinion I don't think offensive materials should be removed because books tell you what they are about in the back, and movies tell you what they are rated. It is the mom's or dad's fault. They are the ones who allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. If they don't want us to learn it, then they shouldn't even get it for us. The reason they get it for us is because kids are spoiled. They want every little thing in the world, and the parents are buying it for them to make them happy. The parents are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame too. They are the ones who want to go to the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. Kids also say offensive language to each other and expect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to their parents and say, 'What does that word mean?' It happened to me, and I said those words to my parents. When I first read, heard, and watched it and told my parents what it means, I got hit for saying that word. I thought to myself that they didn't want to hear that from me. I was mad that I ever said that word. I wished I could go back in time and never say that to my parents. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. I just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that I wished I never heard. I heard it so many times I couldn't get it out of my head. It is like they knew what it meant, but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly. I was pretty sure they didn't tell their parents because the one who told their parents got hit, still wondering what it meant, still having the red mark on their face, thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. When I found out what it meant, I never said it for a long time until someone got me so mad I started to say it again. Now the two opinions still stand. Should we blame the parents or the kids? Should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choice is yours, not mine. If it were mine, I would blame the kids, and no, we shouldn't take down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us, we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this: 'What you decide, people will be against it no matter what.' In the end, we need to find a balance between personal responsibility and the freedom of expression in a way that respects the rights and sensibilities of all.
1221	4198	2	3	Libraries across the world are currently facing the significant obstacle of censorship. In this modern day and age, censorship has become an even more prominent issue. Censorship can affect various forms of media, including books, music, movies, magazines, and many other forms of creative expression. This situation poses the question: is censorship a good thing, or is it bad? Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a particular person finds the book to be offensive. Everyone has their own opinions about things, so why should one person's opinion affect what the rest of us are allowed to learn? What one person finds offensive could be perfectly acceptable to everyone else. Moreover, you are not being forced to engage with something you don't want to. If you find censorship offensive, then one simple solution is to avoid the censored material! Censorship not only impacts the learner; it also affects the writer. Censorship takes away the one thing a writer holds dear: their freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice their thoughts on various topics, to show others how they perceive the world, and to share their personal experiences. Through their work, writers establish a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate to. Writers should have the right to choose what they want to convey to the world, and they should be given the privilege to do so. Even if you manage to implement censorship on books and music at a library, you can't censor the internet. The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites they like, offering a vast array of books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores. A library is a public space, just like the internet. Anyone should be able to access and enjoy the content they like. Imposing censorship on things is almost equivalent to preventing a teacher from teaching because of their nationality or silencing our president from giving a speech because of his race. Censorship is based on an individual's opinion. It shouldn't affect the learners or the writers. Censorship restricts the voice of society and the thoughts of ordinary people. In conclusion, censorship should not exist as it goes against the principles of freedom and the diversity of ideas.
1222	4199	2	3	Libraries are often mistakenly thought of as just a room full of books inside a school building. In reality, they are spread all over the country and are utilized by people of all ages. Due to this wide - reaching usage, I firmly believe that there should not be a restriction on what books a library puts on their shelves. If the books and magazines are clearly labeled, then a person can simply stay away from what he or she finds offensive. However, in the case of a school library, all the books, of course, should be age - appropriate. Just because you don't like a particular item doesn't mean your neighbor won't. For instance, if someone finds a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will share the same view. Since all people have different tastes and perspectives, no one will like the exact same movies as the next person. Therefore, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves, as it would prevent the enjoyment of another individual. This principle applies equally to magazines, books, and anything available at a library. Parental concern for their children is also an important factor. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that a parent of a young child finds offensive, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book. This is where I believe organization and limitations come into play. The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be placed in a separate section, perhaps in a different room or on a different level of the building. This would prevent the accidental discovery by children. Along with proper organization, I think there should be a limitation. So, if a child were to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that is not appropriate or offensive to the parent, they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian. Outside of public libraries, school libraries have different requirements in my opinion. Elementary libraries, of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent. All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for educational purposes. At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article. At the middle and high school level, I think things should change a little, but they should still be much more strict than a public library and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers, as long as they comply with the school rules. Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. Because of this diversity of opinion, there should be no restrictions in public libraries, and people should be able to get the books or movies they want. Within a school corporation, the environment changes, and the rules must be adjusted accordingly. Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library, no matter how old the students are. In conclusion, libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves, as they need to balance the needs of different users while maintaining appropriate standards.
1223	4200	2	3	I don't think that music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken away. If you take all of these forms of entertainment away, then there really wouldn't be much to do in your spare time other than being bored. I know a lot of people couldn't handle being bored. I certainly couldn't handle it if I was bored all the time just because someone took away music. Now, it would be a different story if we had never had music, movies, and all that other great stuff in the first place. In that case, people probably wouldn't care because they wouldn't know what it was or have heard about it. Just think about it. How would you feel if you had to drive for three hours and didn't have any music to listen to or magazines to read? I'm guessing you would be extremely bored. You'd probably find the long drive unbearable, constantly looking for something to occupy your mind. Without these forms of entertainment, time would seem to drag on, and the journey would become a real chore. In conclusion, taking away music, movies, and magazines would significantly reduce our options for entertainment and make our free time much less enjoyable, so they should not be removed.
1224	4201	2	3	Libraries hold more than just books, magazines, and movies... They hold history. Without any doubt, there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread throughout the thousands of books and magazines a library holds. Some people find this terrible, but I, on the other hand, completely disagree. Every book has a unique story to tell, and everyone comprehends the content differently. So, I think libraries shouldn't take out offensive material from their shelves. What's really considered offensive? This question would be very difficult to answer because everyone has a different view, different opinions, and a different background. Some would say that violence, drugs, gangs, and sexual situations are offensive... While others consider religion, beliefs, traditions, and morals offensive. With all the different views on what someone finds offensive, a library would have to almost completely clean their shelves just to remove a small portion of it. There are many sections in a library, from fiction to children's stories. If there is an area for 'children books' and 'adult books,' then why can't there be one for materials some readers would find offensive? Libraries could even mark a book if it held something offensive. This simple solution would settle many conflicts! If a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content, they would have no right to get upset. Limiting our libraries' shelves is unthinkable. If someone got offended by what they read, they could put the book down just as quickly as they picked it up. A public library is a public place, visited by many people... So, if one person gets offended by something they read or saw, it doesn't mean the next person will. The bottom line is, no book should be taken away because someone couldn't handle what was being said. 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Since everyone's view on offensive material is different, eliminating it would be extremely hard. One person found this book offensive, so it's gone... The library would become pointless. The shelves would empty because of the loss of many great books. People do get offended; that's just life... I don't think that they should be able to take a book away from everyone just because of one person's opinion on it. In conclusion, libraries should keep a diverse collection of materials, allowing readers to make their own choices, rather than removing potentially offensive content.
1225	4202	2	3	Censorship has been the topic of many intense debates involving politicians, civil rights activists, and the everyday citizen. There are groups that firmly believe the government has every right to censor anything that is considered offensive in today's society. Some individuals could argue against this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the government's position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not. I just so happen to agree with this counter - argument. One common opinion, mainly supported by people with children, is that books, music, and movies, etc., should be censored to protect the younger generations. While it is true that parents should be concerned with what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is part of an adult's everyday life is completely restricted from a child, how is he or she expected to be prepared and thrive in the future? Why do we spend at least twelve years of our lives going to school? We go to school to prepare ourselves for the challenges of being an adult. We place ourselves in an environment that is specifically designed to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity. If a child is not properly exposed to certain aspects of the real world, there is absolutely no way they can be prepared to encounter them in the future. However, not all individuals support censorship because of their children. There are adults who would like to see no more of today's offensive material for themselves than they would want their children to see. My rebuttal to this is that if you do not want to see it, then simply don't choose to see it. No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in today's media. You can turn off the television if the program bothers you. You can choose not to read the book or magazine. You can change the radio station. Every person is capable of controlling what they hear and see, and it is unnecessary to attempt to remove from society what could simply be ignored. Lastly, one of the most consistent debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in today's media. Think back in America's history; when has giving the government more power in our everyday lives ever been beneficial for our society? The reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were deprived of in Europe. The Bill of Rights was created to ensure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control. The freedom of speech is not just referring to what comes from an individual's mouth, but what goes into their eyes and ears as well. The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for themselves what is offensive to them and what is not. It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who attempt to break it apart, but not to control what we see and hear. Meetings and debates are held every day to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom. I ask why some individuals would want to give away one of the freedoms we already have? The United States is one of the greatest countries ever to exist, yet we seem too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives? It is time for our society to stop relying on the government to make these decisions and start taking responsibility for our own media consumption. In conclusion, censorship by the government is unnecessary and goes against the principles of freedom, and citizens should be empowered to make their own choices.
1226	4203	2	3	Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but it all depends on who you are and what angers you. Some people think that books, music, movies, and other forms of media can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but something can only affect a certain amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several reasons for and against taking books out of our libraries.  From what I hear, people do get angry over things, but the question is what gets them so angry? What is offensive is different for some people than others. For example, a sports team fan reads a book about their team and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. Others can get mad at a movie because it discriminates against races of other kinds. Like how in the 1960s, some movies characterized African - Americans as stubborn, ignorant human beings. In my view, actually being African - American myself, it sort of aggravates me too, but nonetheless, I shouldn't argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.  What is offensive depends on how it angers them also. Like how back in World War II, the Jewish people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the Germans. That can be offensive and is usually used to sway people to one side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldn't worry about it, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read it with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if it is truly offensive to people in general, not just you.  Then after that, the main question we would ask would be what should we do next? If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library it came from and ask them to read it. If they think it is offensive, then they would more than likely take it off the shelves. Now, just because someone who likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, don't tell the library. That's just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read it. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and discrimination, but not over a sports team.  So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to where something can actually be offensive. Or maybe it's just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelves for only very good reasons, not silly ones.
1227	4204	2	3	I believe that people are able to remove things such as books, music, movies, magazines, and other items that they need to use. There are many people who need these things because of their pursuit of knowledge.  First, we should be allowed to use items such as books from the shelves. Everyone is allowed to get things like books from the shelves, which can mean any other person's books or those from a library. They take these items because they need to use them and they think that they could be helpful to their work.  Another important reason is that we don't have enough memories to handle many situations. There are many serious problems and also sudden accidents in real - life. We don't have enough stored memories to solve those real - life situations. That's why we are allowed to take off a book from the shelf.  The most important reason is that people want to know a lot of knowledge. I think it is people's desire to know everything and be smarter than other people or their competitors. So, they need many things for their knowledge and take them from the shelves.  In conclusion, things such as books and magazines are allowed to be taken from the shelves. Then, the knowledge from the books and magazines can spread to many people who need it, which is beneficial for the growth and learning of the community.
1228	4205	2	3	Do you like what I like? Maybe and maybe not. What is or isn't offensive to you compared to others varies on both ends. Why? Everyone has their own point of view. You may or may not agree, and we have others who simply don't care. There are many factors that influence this, which include: religious beliefs, having independence, and experimenting.  Religious beliefs are important, would you not agree? Certain material in this world may be offensive to those with specific religious beliefs. Such as the topic of gay rights. This may not apply to everyone else, as some are not accepting of it. For the ones who do accept it, you can tell they are open - minded. Unlike the rebels going against it, that is their own state of mind. I believe it is important that you go along with your religious beliefs as long as they don't cause harm to others.  Independence is what we are or what we assume to have or already possess. Whether the music, movies, magazines, etc. are offensive to others, this has no real effects on you. Why? It is because you know what is right and wrong. So what if all the nonsense things may have caught your attention. Should you take control and get rid of it? No. It does not bother you. You take it as it is, being independent and not letting such things sway your own judgment.  Experimenting is self - contained. As simple as it is, you either do it or don't. It is more than likely that people are or were under the influence. I, myself, have been in that situation before. I'm known to be the crazy child in the family. My dad would always lecture me about being careful with who I hang out with when I'm out. As a teenager, I let those words pass by me. I was always the youngest out of the people I hung out with. Was I ever under the influence? Yes. Did I ever get hurt? No. I can and will say I experimented with life, learning from my experiences.  Does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad? It usually varies. Regarding religious beliefs, it may or may not be disrespectful. To have independence, you are the one in control. Experimenting is a choice on your own. What is offensive to me may not be to you. I have my own state of mind and so do you. We should respect each other's differences and make our own decisions based on what we believe is right.
1229	4206	2	3	Dear Newspaper Editor,  I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive, mind - grabbing, sexual content in any of the stories, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitting around. For example, on the radio, the music they play like rap, hip - hop with all the cussing and singing about money, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio. And adult books that are sitting around in bookstores, ready to be read by adults, not children.  The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day, just not when they are 10 or 12 years old looking at pornographic magazines and movies. This kind of content can have a negative impact on their innocent minds and development. So I hope you keep this in mind and get that stuff off the streets and out of children's hands. By doing so, we can create a healthier and more appropriate environment for our younger generation.
1230	4207	2	3	Banned books. All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work that I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us. Katherine Paterson Author  I believe and will stand by Katherine's statement above. Who has the right to say if a book is offensive? People have a right to their opinion, but I do not think any one has the right to take books away from a public library.  A public library, the facts are in the name. It is a public library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on an academic assignment, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offended someone does not make sense to me. A person can pick up a book, be offended and complain about it. That is freedom of speech. I do not see fault in that. But when a person picks up a book, is offended, and demands that the book per se be taken off the shelves of a public library. That is when I have issues seeing where they think they have the right.  Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Isn't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelf at his or her own will? I fear the outcome of that. I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book.  Taking books off the shelf is taking knowledge away from the people. We as citizens have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slightest whim to read, and be able to read that book without prosecution from people that find the book in question 'offensive.'  The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, is the day our First Amendment fails. As a nation, we need to stand strong against banning books from public libraries. For our generation and for the many generations to follow, we must protect the freedom of access to knowledge and diverse ideas.
1231	4208	2	3	One @MONTH1, some individuals subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to their own personal opinion. I personally firmly disagree with this concept. The facts clearly point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has thus instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences. Certain vivid examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.   Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few valid reasons. First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and privileges upheld firmly in the face of the law. Our founding fathers carefully wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public. The first ten amendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted from this significant effort.   Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries. The removal of these principles so deeply ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar. We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that.   Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society. I can mention three well - known books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship. '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens in a chilling manner. '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to an omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omniscient surveillance even though I have not read the composition myself. '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar. All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.   In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method. In any case, a more effective solution must exist today. To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.   Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity. The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces. Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings. Different regions utilize different systems, but that of the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.   As explained, censorship already exists in a form acceptable to all. Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor. Capable parents most definitely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years. Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset. It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst - case scenario and use responsibly the systems available for this purpose.
1232	4209	2	3	The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are a profound form of art. They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses a significant part of itself.   Censorship is the underlying problem to many things. It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion - emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are vividly conveyed in books and films. If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth.   Many people can only express themselves in their art - and art can be very real. So real that we don't think that it's possible. We don't want to believe something like 'The @CAPS1' could happen. 'The @CAPS1' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home. Because this man is very rich, he has lots of valuable material wealth. Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it. Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries. But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house. Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy. It is this that makes us think deeply, and therein lies the problems with censorship. If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves.   The loss of books has been seen throughout history. Most prominently, the Nazi regime. In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the Nazi ideals. The censorship escalated into the Nazis burning books in large piles. This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset. The movement swelled and the @CAPS3 people soon developed a national pride and goal. By the @DATE1's, nearly every @CAPS3 who could read had read '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'. The censorship had turned into an all - out war on classical literature and the promotion of Nazi ideas. That was how @CAPS7 was actually voted in. Many don't realize, but the @CAPS8 actually did vote @CAPS7 to be leader. Now that the Nazis had destroyed the public's ideals, they were replaced with the Nazis' own.   The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self - knowledge. The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates. If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words. The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are. Censorship has never ended in something good - only the promotion of something bad. If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own, and this would be a great loss for the progress of humanity.
1233	4210	2	3	What I think about that is that you have your own unique thoughts about a book. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others won't. There @MONTH1 be something that you like in a book that you don't find in a movie, and there may be something that you like in a movie that others @MONTH1 not like in a book. But that doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelf.   About magazines, if there are things in a magazine that you don't want to look at or have your children look at, then yes, it might seem reasonable to take it off the shelf. I mean, come on now, it's a library. There should be certain standards for what is available there. That's all I'm saying. We should respect the diversity of opinions and interests, but also ensure that the library environment is suitable for all.
1234	4211	2	3	There are many different things in the media that are shown every day that are very offensive. I'm sure everyone can honestly say that they've watched or heard at least one thing in the media that they got offended by. Also, people need to remember that this is a free country, and everyone has the right to freedom of speech. None of the television companies, or radio stations should get in trouble just because someone is offended, because it's freedom of speech.   I don't get offended by anything I read, listen to, or see on TV. I really don't see how people can get offended by any of it, because it's not like anything is being directly said to that person who's offended. I have heard of people trying to sue record companies for songs that they found offensive. I think that is ridiculous to try to sue someone just because you got offended by it. It's not the record company's fault if you took offense to it, and there is no reason why a fan should have to suffer because of a reason like that. We should respect the freedom of expression in the media and not let over - sensitivity limit the creativity and diversity of content.
1235	4212	2	3	Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people. When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive, what @MONTH1 seem offensive to you @MONTH1 not be offensive to anyone else. Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you @MONTH1 be completely something else in someone else's eyes.   How many humans inhabit the world today? About @NUM1 billion, researchers say. If you think about it, each and every one of those @NUM1 billion minds thinks differently. If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant, it is like taking away a person's ability to learn.   In the world today, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved. What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world. For all you know, the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer. How could you just take that away? Again, the magazine could be offensive to a person who @MONTH1 have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured? Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away?   If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people, we might as well just take all the books, movies, magazines, and comics away that have ever been created. Once again, something that @MONTH1 be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person, because about @NUM1 billion minds do not all think alike. If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive, our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well. We must balance the need to avoid offense with the importance of free access to knowledge.
1236	4213	2	3	Culture and history are two very significant aspects of the world. Libraries are places that carefully house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. This is precisely why I firmly believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will continue to be a key aspect of living, and libraries generously offer this to people freely! How can one possibly take that freedom away from another? Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occurred in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the Holocaust, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings may offend some, but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans, yet we always seem to try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth. Some people are easily offended, and some are not. But the true question is, 'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing evolution in the Christian religion is offensive, and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose beliefs directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material because their purpose is to hold knowledge, not just what people want to know. How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occurred in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people of solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man. In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this, we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn are our greatest assets and must be treasured.
1237	4214	2	3	People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want, but parents or other family members may tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their parents or not. If these children do not listen, we need to take appropriate measures. We need to have clear rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in their lives. Adults have the right to keep children away from this information. Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library. Children, adults, and teens all have their own dedicated sections. These groups of people have the right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to. I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit, we can effectively prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can access this information at any time, but adults can take steps to eliminate it. Children in libraries should be supervised. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material may give off bad information to a child. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex. Parents should be the first to tell their child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnancy as well. Learning about pregnancy may make them wonder how that woman got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children. Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Children read about gangs and may think that it is cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be accessible to children. After some children read about it, they may get their friends involved. This information can spread across the school. Violence is very harmful for children. Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read. If that library has offensive material, it is their job to ensure that material does not get into a young person's hands. They should be able to enforce strict limits on age - appropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections where they may find harmful information should be restricted to young children. Children in libraries should be supervised. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnancy should not be allowed for children to read. Violence in books seems to spread across schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from reaching all children.
1238	4215	2	3	I think that there should be special rooms where certain adult books are kept. I think that people should have to be of a certain age to access the books in that section. I feel strongly that libraries should have every different kind of book for anyone. Everyone goes to a library, so I think it should be an open - access library and have all different kinds of books. If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book, someone of age should have to come there and check the book out for them. I think that libraries are for everyone in a community, and not everyone reads and looks at only good - natured books. Some look at more explicit or adult - themed books, and they should have the right to go and check out books like that. When you go to a library, you should be able to go there and get whatever genre that you want, and there should be no restrictions. I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels, and if they are extremely explicit, then they should be kept behind the desk, and you have to be of age to get them. My conclusion is that if you are going to look at all kinds of books, there should be no restrictions on what you look at. You should be of age for romance novels and derogatory books, but for the library, they should have tons of books and magazines with no unnecessary restrictions.
1239	4216	2	3	What do we find offensive? In a library, there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to someone. For example, with movies, there are horror, sci - fi, comedy, romance, adventure, etc., and all of these genres can be offensive to someone. If we were to take down all of the movies that are offensive to a person, all the movies would be taken off the shelves. Should we take all things that are offensive to us off the shelves, or leave them so that people who do enjoy them can? I believe that we should leave these materials alone. It should not be right for us to choose what a public library should and shouldn't have on their shelves. If a person finds an item offensive, then they should ignore it, not make a big deal of it. Many people learn to keep their opinions to themselves, but some do not. People who judge by what they don't like tend to make themselves known. In a diverse society, we must respect the fact that different people have different sensibilities. The library is a place for the free flow of ideas, and we should not let individual sensitivities dictate what is available to everyone. By leaving the materials as they are, we allow for a more inclusive and open - minded environment.
1240	4217	2	3	Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society. Our lives have been increasingly taken over by political correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer truly our own. Until recently, we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media. But now, if something is found to be offensive in any way, it is essentially silenced or removed. Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our rights as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can access. It also ensures that one day, there may be little left of media that is truly free - flowing. The Constitution of the United States, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech. Censorship actively and violently violates that right. Our country was built on the foundation of free speech, and now it is being gradually eroded. Our own words are being forced down our throats, never allowed to come out. Censorship ensures that no diverse opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, and that no one can think independently. Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech? We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say. We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to have the right to express them. Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form. Arguments come, but these arguments allow people to see other perspectives that they hadn't considered and look at issues from new angles. We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions. And from there, we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with ideas and knowledge, and enabling our society to advance. But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone. However, there will always be someone who is unhappy. It's the inevitable truth. Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world. In a way, this makes sense. We don't want our children to be exposed to the atrocities that happen in everyday life. We don't want them to know what's happening behind closed doors. However, if we don't allow people to confront these realities, they can never truly understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come. Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to take steps to stop these realities and be prepared for when they happen to them. For example, let's look at the issue of rape. Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens. It is a harsh part of reality. Rape can be censored from books, television, and other forms of media. We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist. But that doesn't solve anything. That doesn't get rid of rape. It still exists. And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop? How will a rape ever be able to be prevented? How will someone know what to expect or what to do? By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape. Knowledge of rape is crucial if it is ever going to be stopped. Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't make it go away. Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it fails to do so. It hurts the people by cutting off their access to knowledge. We as people need knowledge. We thrive on knowledge. And the way we obtain this knowledge is through various forms of media. Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually. It may not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on, the gap will widen, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp. Is this fair? Is this right? Is this helping us? How does cutting out knowledge ever benefit us? It brings us backwards in time, instills fear in us. It is human nature to fear the unknown. The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear. Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to function in society. This is wrong and immoral. It is unfair, if nothing else. We should be allowed to access any knowledge that exists. No good comes from hiding it. Lastly, this gradual suppression of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways. And as time goes on, it can only get worse. Censorship is based on the concept of offensiveness. If something could be offensive, it is removed. However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone. Therefore, following the logic of censorship, everything and everyone should be censored to fulfill its goal. This means all media of any kind should be destroyed. No one should be allowed to express themselves. The world would be forced to be silent. All knowledge would be taken away. Chaos would ensue. The people's freedom would be completely taken away. The freedom to know would vanish right in front of their eyes. This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue. We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship. Yes, people's feelings may be hurt, but we cannot sacrifice our freedom of speech and access to knowledge to spare those feelings. These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.
1241	4218	2	3	Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelf. People might need those materials for in - depth research purposes or if they simply have a curiosity to find out about something specific. If the material is offensive to someone, they can report it, but the library staff might not take any action as they have to balance various factors. The people who find something offensive could also simply ignore it and just walk away. If I found something that was offensive to me, I would first take a quick look at it to see what it says, but I would not make a fuss about it. There are indeed some people who would have to look at that offensive material for research or other important reasons. So, why get it removed from the shelf? I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet, but if I did, I would remain silent. Now, some people would raise their voices, but what if you walked into a library looking for a book for your crucial research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive? What would you do? Yes, you could turn to the internet, but it might not have exactly what you are looking for. I have had a lot of research papers during my academic life. There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a single book or a relevant magazine to help me with my research. I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look for information. When I finally got on the computer, I only had an hour to look up everything. I did not manage to finish in time and had to turn in my paper late. Computers are useful for looking up stuff, but when you have a specific book in mind that would provide a wealth of information, you naturally go for the book rather than the computer. I know there are materials that are offensive to people, and I understand that people get angry about them. However, it is not the library's fault. They most likely have to have those materials on the shelf because that is what is required by regulations or the nature of a comprehensive collection. So, if people do get mad, they can either report it or just walk away and ignore it. In conclusion, while offensive materials can be a concern, removing them without proper consideration can cause more harm than good, and individuals should take responsibility for their own choices in the library.
1242	4219	2	3	To @CAPS1 it @DATE2 concern, in real - life situations, @CAPS2 in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song that is constantly played on the radio, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis in public places. Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws. The library is a public space for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's diverse personalities, we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities. @PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' @CAPS3 is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should have some censorship, but up to a specific point. We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library - and perhaps the most innocent - are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another. For example, if one mother thinks a book that talks about a certain social issue she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not share the same view. The first mother's opinion is different from everyone else; she could say she wanted @CAPS3 book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone? Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual. I have dealt with situations like @CAPS3 before; everyone has. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash. Everyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left. The library shelves would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point. Taking into account everyone's diversification in @CAPS3 world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there. When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals. @CAPS2 is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it every day with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them. @CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount of censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. After all, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty. In conclusion, finding the right balance of censorship in the library is essential to ensure that it remains a useful and inclusive space for all.
1243	4220	2	3	Libraries are meant for all types of books, movies, music, and magazines. They offer a wide variety of things to look at or even check out, catering to different interests and needs. An offensive book or movie or even music should not be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad elements in it. People @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Through my own experiences, observations, and the reading I've done, I will explain my opinion on why I don't think offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelf. If a book is offensive, it does not necessarily deserve to be removed. Somebody most likely worked hard on that book, spending a lot of time and effort to create it so that it could be put on the library shelf. If you find a book offensive, it should be placed in a different section that clearly tells you in advance what kind of books are in that section. I have not had any real - life experiences with this, but I know that library staff are aware of what is in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not place anything offensive next to a children's book. The same principle applies to music and @CAPS1's. Music is a form of art and it is there to be listened to. People like all types of music and have their favorite bands. So, if they don't like certain bands because they swear or have other controversial elements, it doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf. @CAPS1's usually have the rating on the front, which is a clear indication. So, if it is not appropriate for your age, then don't pick it up. If it has nudity or sexual content, it will be clearly marked or be put in a different section. For instance, at my old library where I used to live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, they would put all rated @CAPS2 movies into a separate section. If you were going to check it out, you would have to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent with you. It is really all up to the person; they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice. It's not the library's fault if you pick up an offensive book because, well, you should have some common sense. The libraries shouldn't have to take offensive things off the shelves just because some people lack common sense or don't know what they are doing. They could make more of an effort to separate bad from good, wrong from right, and appropriate from non - appropriate materials. But ultimately, it is usually all up to the person making that decision. In conclusion, while libraries can take steps to manage offensive materials, the responsibility also lies with the users to make informed choices.
1244	4221	2	3	I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a special room just for grown - ups. In the Dunkirk library, there is a room that has just adult books. The kids cannot go in there without a parent. So, whenever you go in there, your parents are with you. However, I don't think you can check those adult books out. If I had a kid, I would not want them to see that kind of adult - oriented stuff until they got older. So, I think there should be separate rooms in libraries. That way, when they get older and more mature, they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them. But on the other hand, why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see? Because if not, they're going to see it in other places or from other people. Then they go home asking their mom what this means and stuff. Why not let them learn on their own from a book in a relatively controlled environment? There are some people that would agree with that view, but then there are also people that would disagree with it. So, maybe there should be rooms for different types of books and you can go in them whenever you want, or maybe there should be strict rules that you can't go in there without a parent. I don't know what to do. Maybe there should be a vote between people if they like the idea of such a setup or not. But some people would be mad over that. If you choose one option, someone would not like it or something like that. My opinion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on their own. Some people would think I'm a bad parent, but would you want your child to find out about certain things somewhere else in an unregulated way? In conclusion, the issue of censorship in libraries regarding adult - oriented materials is complex, and while different solutions have their pros and cons, finding a balance that respects both the rights of adults and the protection of children is crucial.
1245	4222	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to direct the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a deeper meaning behind it. The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to freely speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure, there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There may be something out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you had the courage to stand up and tell that company yourself? Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that right, you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine may be offensive to an abundant number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it. However, that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone, and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write
1246	4223	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, music, etc., are all great forms of entertainment to read, watch, or listen to. When I listen to music, watch movies, or even read books at times, I often wonder how people come up with these creative ideas. The real issue is that some of the content in the music, books, and movies that people consume can be quite offensive. In today's world, there's a lot of music filled with negative portrayals of people, using curse words. It's not a good look for either the musicians or the listeners. I firmly believe that such offensive music should not be available on the shelves and should be removed. Parents definitely don't want their young children exposed to that kind of negative music because when they grow up, they might imitate the behavior they hear in those songs. However, I feel that movies should generally not be removed from the shelves. The reason is that movies come in various genres like funny, scary, and sad. Sometimes, a bit of offensive content is necessary in a movie; without it, most movies wouldn't be as engaging. One of my favorite movies is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It's about a character from the past, @CAPS1, and @CAPS4 getting back together to embark on one more mission. That movie was offensive in some parts, but it was still a great watch because it had cool cars and well - developed characters. Movies should never be removed from the shelves because the so - called offensive elements actually add to the fun. People wouldn't be able to go to the movies with their friends and have a great time otherwise. If you're taking little kids to the movies, just make sure to pick the right ones for them. To conclude, music isn't a bad thing to listen to as there's also good music out there. All I'm saying is to be careful about what you listen to and don't get into trouble by trying to imitate what's said in the music. As for movies, keep producing good ones and maintain their quality.
1247	4224	2	3	People often go to the library with the intention of finding specific types of material. However, some individuals get offended by certain materials in the library and advocate for their removal. But certain materials should not be removed just because they are offensive to some, as they might be enjoyed by others. Offensive material can sometimes be important historical content that the world needs to know, such as the history of racism. If people were unaware of the significance of slavery, they wouldn't understand the past and why society is the way it is today. History is an integral part of life, which is why we have history classes to educate us about the events we've been through. Not all offensive material in the library is related to history. Some materials contain elements of sex and violence that can be offensive. Libraries should put clear labels on each section to inform people about the nature of the material. If people are aware of the content and still choose to view it, then they should accept the consequences. The material shouldn't be removed just because someone didn't like it. I remember in history class, we learned about wars with violent aspects that some of my classmates disliked. But that's what actually happened, and it's important for us to know. Materials are created for a purpose. They should not be removed if they are offensive to one person but not to another. I've read books in school with various forms of violence and other things that some people might not like, but it's all part of history. History makes a difference in our lives, and we need it. If you find something offensive, simply choose not to view that material again.
1248	4225	2	3	I firmly believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves only if they are truly offensive. Just because something is offensive to one person doesn't mean it will be offensive to everyone. For instance, any movie you watch might be offensive to one or two people, but not to the majority. So, I would say no to removing offensive items from the shelves. The question is, who is really going to be offended by it, and are they genuinely offended or just making a fuss? Also, I suspect that some people might lie about being offended just to get an item removed from the shelf. For example, if there's a movie with a lot of bad words, I can understand the argument for removing it as many people don't like such language. However, if it's being removed for just one minor thing, I don't think that should be allowed. If a person is offended by what a book or a movie says, they should simply choose not to read or watch it. No one is forcing them to engage with content they don't want to. Reading a book or watching a movie is a personal choice, not dictated by others. This really boils down to a person's beliefs. For example, someone who goes to church every day probably won't be interested in watching the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' They'll pick a movie that suits their lifestyle and what they're accustomed to. Maybe they were recommended a movie by a friend and watched it, and then took offense. But that was their choice; they didn't have to watch it. If we start removing books, movies, or music just because someone was offended, there would be hardly anything left. Are you really going to listen to every single person who comes in and says, 'This book offended me, I want you to take it off the shelf'? I find it hard to believe that you'll accommodate every such request. Also, how do you know it was truly offensive to them? Are you going to have them show you what the problem with the book was? My guess is no because dealing with so many people over one or a few books would be a hassle. I'm not denying that people can get offended by what books and movies say, but there will be many more than just one person coming in with complaints about multiple books or movies. So, if we keep removing items, there would be no books left. What if someone comes in and requests a particular movie, and you have to say, '@CAPS4, I'm sorry we had to take that movie off the shelf because it offended someone.' I'm sure that person won't be happy, and you'll have some explaining to do. Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something that was removed, and they say it was a great movie? If you listen to one person's complaint, isn't it fair to listen to the person who likes the movie too? I believe there are two sides to every story. Therefore, I think you should listen to both sides. If someone wants to have an item removed, that's fine, but if someone else asks for that specific item, they should be allowed to have it. It won't hurt the person who was offended by the book or movie. In conclusion, I think books, movies, and music should generally stay on the shelves unless more than one person complains, in which case it's a different situation.
1249	4226	2	3	Movies are as inseparable from popcorn as music is from headphones. It's all fun and games until the innocence of the youth is severely damaged. The simplest forms of entertainment are being distorted by today's world. Many children in modern society are quickly getting used to seeing and reacting to the media available in everyday stores, shops, or libraries. The innocence of today's youth is gradually being eroded by the subliminal messages in music, magazines, and movies. The messages in each type of media are often the same: sex, drugs, and violence. The music industry has undergone a huge transformation over the past few decades. We've gone from jazz, disco, funk, rock, and hard rock to the dominance of hip - hop/rap in our era. Each of these music genres was popular in a specific decade. In today's time, the music industry is flooded with rap and hip - hop music, which often revolves around the themes of sex, drugs, and violence. Almost every song you hear on the radio or your iPod is likely to have something to do with one of these three themes. The sense of naivety and innocence in young people is shattered every time they listen to such songs on the radio. The youth should not be exposed to this kind of music, and parents need to be more vigilant about what their children are listening to and consider the impact of the media on them. Recently, more people are turning to articles and short works to read instead of the traditional novels. The novels written in the past were clean and non - explicit. However, today's literature has taken a different turn. More and more, @ORGANIZATION1 companies are becoming less traditional and more open about sexual, violent, or drug - related topics. For example, in @ORGANIZATION1, you'll find articles specifically about sexual actions. And on the other side of the page, there might be an ad for @CAPS1 cigarettes. Soon, kids will start thinking that everything they see is acceptable and might act on it. Libraries that offer these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals in these publications. There has always been subliminal messaging in the movie industry. Movies are a classic form of entertainment. But recently, almost all movies in the box office subtly or blatantly convey messages about sex, drugs, and violence. There are action movies filled with fighting, blood, and punching, and then there are romantic movies where the main characters seem to resolve their emotional conflicts through sexual encounters. These movies are available in libraries across the country and are easily accessible to children. The youth in our country should not be exposed to such content as it is not morally right. Overall, library censorship is quite weak. The people responsible for allowing this kind of media to be accessible to kids need to re - evaluate their moral standards. The more a child is exposed to media with subliminal or obvious messages about sex, drugs, and violence, the more they'll think it's okay to engage in such actions. Eventually, all sense of innocence will be lost, and children will no longer be the innocent beings they should be.
1250	4227	2	3	Why would anyone advocate for censorship in a library? The reason often given is that certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines can be offensive. But if something is offensive, then why put it in a library that is open to the public, including children, in the first place? First of all, while censorship has its place, it's not necessary in libraries. Libraries are a haven for all kinds of literature, where people who love reading can come together and explore different works. Censorship disrupts this by removing books from the shelves just because they are considered offensive. When dealing with an offensive book, the first step should be to determine the target audience that might be offended. Then, assess whether it's offensive even to an adult audience. If it's offensive to adults, it should be removed from the library shelves. Otherwise, it can be placed in the adult section. Libraries should have well - defined sections for different types of books and literature. As mentioned earlier, if a book is too offensive for non - adult audiences, it should be placed in the adult section. Books suitable for children should be in the children's section, and there can also be a section for young adults for books appropriate for teenagers. Having these sections in a library largely eliminates the need for censorship. They help in properly categorizing books and other literature so that only readers of the appropriate ages can access them. In conclusion, using sections in a library is a better alternative to censorship. If we were to censor books on the library shelves, eventually, there would be very few books left for anyone to read. Sections allow books to remain in the library while ensuring that they reach the right audience.
1251	4228	2	3	As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to a certain extent. With our school library being censored, I firmly believe that the public library should not be. Why is censorship a conflict in need of in - depth discussion? Every book found on a shelf is a part of history, so every author who was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored according to their age - group, I feel that public libraries should not be censored. The simple reason is that you, your guardian, and also the library have control over what they find age - appropriate. If disliking a book is a problem, then simply put it back and find something more in line with your own interest. Some things may be considered inappropriate, as many things are, but at the same time, each person has their own limits regarding this. While someone may dislike a teen magazine because of how it affects youth, another may find it inspiring. If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves, as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote. When you enter a public library, it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, etc. When you enter a school library, it is organized according to fiction, non - fiction, and author. Censorship among public libraries is not needed. Adults, students, and children all go to a public library. So, as the case may be, why would you censor a library that caters to all ages? I feel that yes, an elementary, or middle school library should not contain the same content as a high school library. But a public library is for the public, as the name implies. In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, and adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. So, as the fact may be that some things may seem inappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group.
1252	4229	2	3	I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries, except for things such as complete smut and pornography. However, there are many different beliefs on this subject. Some parents may think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more lenient. The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are. A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false. Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs. The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it. Reading one book with a couple of curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child, because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life. It may even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises. I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, sex novels, racist books, etc. Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers, and quit treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad' things out there. Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world. If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it, they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive' books. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library censorship is crucial, allowing access to a wide range of materials while protecting against truly harmful content.
1253	4230	2	3	Offensive media. Books, music, magazines, movies, commercials. Is it right to have all types of offensive media shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this media contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming media should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home. Even though some people may not take offense to any type of media, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this media brings. Some content may not be suitable for younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibility to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgments. Religion. Our religion plays a big part in what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the media contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult - rated content to respect those who disagree. A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended. Offensive media can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community by making appropriate arrangements for offensive media.
1254	4231	2	3	The book called [Title]. The book is about a young African - American man that starts school at [School Name]. During the first few weeks in school, he is constantly picked on and made fun of. So one day, he decides to join a boxing class and the wrestling team at his school. Through hard work and determination, he gradually gains confidence. But at the end of the book, he ends up fighting everybody who was bullying him. I personally think the book should be kept on the shelf because it's a life - changing experience for a young man. For some people, this book is so impactful that they will or have even read this book several times. I know I have. I only hope that other people will like or even love this book as much as I have. So I guess what I am trying to say is you really never know what you are going to like until you sit there and read it from beginning to the end. In conclusion, this book offers valuable lessons and should remain accessible to readers.
1255	4232	2	3	When you go into a library, have you ever noticed the many subjects people write about? Some are from their own experience and some are made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producers of these sorts of entertainment were made to be read, heard, or watched by people that are interested in them! Also, if the libraries are having difficulties with the complaints towards the offensive materials, they should just make a separate section. To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced? The answer is simple! They are produced to entertain us, to expand our knowledge on things, and to let us have interest. If none of these things were invented, life would be extremely boring. Now, I'm not saying we need these offensive materials, but I'm saying they are there so we can think more broadly about topics instead of the same - old - same - old. Producers create 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of the library where nobody goes just because it has some things others may not like. If you don't like those types of things, stay away from them; don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people who made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're second - guessing if they're good enough to be shelf - worthy. There are many books out there that are horrible and a waste of time to read, so should they be removed too? Think about that one. Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these types of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It may cost money, but what's more important: losing tons of customers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already, and I'm sure they could find a little bit more room as they already separate everything into genres. Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of materials from shelves. There may be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they may get ideas from the language and scenes in these sorts of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and tearing their insides out. This man got an idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still, I don't think it should have been removed because an immature, ignorant person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely delusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions, an author has to suffer from money lost and a big waste of his time and effort he put into it. In conclusion, no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance and don't understand that the books, music, or movies were made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff. As I've said, it was made to be either read, heard, or watched. A separate section would be a great solution.
1256	4233	2	3	All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, it doesn't necessarily mean the next person will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict with their kids as others, and some just don't seem to care. Of course, there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and objectifies women, which kids really don't need to be listening to. The horror movies that are rated 'R' for a reason; kids could have nightmares for weeks after watching them. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age, like ten. They still can't tell what's real and what's not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, how to act, what to do, and even how to think. Children just aren't mature enough to handle a majority of the material in this world. No books should be taken away or hidden from society; it should just be up to you at your own discretion. Another possibility would be to have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particular material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary. These days, it's hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This world is becoming less and less sensitive every day. Eventually, everyone will be completely insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books, magazines, TV shows, and music. It won't even affect anyone anymore. In conclusion, while we can't completely shield children from all potentially harmful content, we should take reasonable steps to guide them and let them access information at an appropriate pace.
1257	4234	2	3	Censorship in libraries is something that has both good and bad aspects. I think that there could be some materials that are suitable for adults and some that are appropriate for kids. You don't want kids reading anything that's too mature for them, right? Libraries are found all over the country. A lot of people say, 'Well, they shouldn't even have the book there in the first place.' But think about this, maybe you should just have your kid under control and watch what they read. Or option two, don't have your kid go to a public library. A public library, which let me explain, is a place where the whole community can go pick out something to read. A public library is supposed to have a variety of books so that anybody can find a book they would like to read. Yes, some things are very inappropriate for kids, but that doesn't mean we can't have it in a public library. Just make sure that you know what your kid reads. If you do that, you should be fine, and your kid will be too. That's how I feel about censorship in a library. It's public, so it's meant to have everything. Which everything includes the good and the bad. I think some people just have to live with it. So I honestly feel that libraries, in the way they are, should be left alone. In conclusion, rather than trying to censor libraries, parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's reading choices.
1258	4235	2	3	Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book, the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people, they should just simply not read it. Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read? Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing and offensive, but that doesn't give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short - term answer to a long - term problem. I believe that if we always resort to censoring books, then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who actually want to read a book but never get the chance just because it is censored from the library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help one's imagination. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity? In conclusion, we should resist the urge to censor books and allow people the freedom to make their own reading choices.
1259	4236	2	3	To be honest, if I was a librarian, I would leave the magazines up on the shelves according to what the state law would have to say. If the state doesn't have any problems with having them up on the shelves, then the entire student body will be able to check them out. Having magazines shows what's new in the world and what is not. Also, just like when you check out a book and have to take a test over it called reading counts, then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and write an essay over it and submit it to whoever is in charge of that department. This way, students can not only access current information but also improve their reading and writing skills. In conclusion, as long as it complies with the law, magazines can be a valuable addition to the library with proper assessment methods in place.
1260	4237	2	3	Many things such as books, music, magazines, etc., can cause children to act differently, but I say that everything should stay in the library because there are more things that cause such behavior than the ones that are listed. Many children get their behavioral cues from books, movies, and magazines, but most get them from something different. Children get most of their behavioral patterns from the television shows they are viewing at home, which causes them to think that if their parents don't care about what they're watching, then it's okay to view whatever. So, the main cause of these behaviors is what is being viewed at home or in the movies. So, I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch what's legal on television. But to me, in the libraries, it's up to whoever is in charge to decide based on ages. Just like there are legal things only for adults. I say that it's only for adults because children start arguments from whatever they see, especially when they are around their friends. When children are around their friends, they feel that it's cool to do whatever. And it's all coming from things based on violence in the books that children read more often. So, to me, I will say that it shouldn't be okay for children to access such inappropriate material. In conclusion, while libraries should have a wide range of materials, proper age - based restrictions should be in place to protect children from potentially harmful content.
1261	4238	2	3	I have read a few books that I don't approve of. And I firmly feel that yes, I do have a right to voice my opinion about removing these books from the shelves. But whose opinion should ultimately have an impact? Honestly, I do not think that books should be taken off the shelves or music should be banned, etc. I believe that there should be a bit more authority regarding the age limit of books in libraries, and a separate area for music and other such things. I would not want my kid to walk out of the library with a book about sex, gangs, or stuff that should not be known by a kid. Instead of banning or removing these kinds of books off shelves, why not put a strict age limit on books and actually enforce it. Yes, there is an adult section, a kids section, etc., but I've seen so many young kids walking out with books, magazines, and other adult items. I know how it feels to try and concentrate on a book, newspaper, or magazine you are interested in when people are blaring their headphones. And I still feel the same way about the music as I do with books. Don't ban it from the library, just ban it from certain areas of the library. It's all out of respect for people who are wanting to be in a quiet area. I'm not the type of person who wants to take things away from people because everyone has their own interests and beliefs in life, but I am one who believes in setting rules that should be followed. I see good coming out of everything a library has to offer if only they could exclude things in certain areas and also set and stand by the age limits of the books being checked out. In conclusion, by implementing these measures, the library can better serve all its patrons and create a more appropriate and enjoyable environment.
1262	4239	2	3	They should be allowed to be removed because some books are offensive. Even though they are offensive, they can teach young teenagers about their past. The books could be about the KKK or other similar controversial groups. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went through. The books could also be a school assignment. The way I see it is if your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past, you should allow them to read what they want. Some books such as certain classic works are great to read for school assignments. These educational books are very helpful to read because you can learn about your history and about the wars at the same time. I think if your child checks a book out from the library, he or she should return it in a week. The library should give the child a specific amount of time to return the book. If the child does not return the book in that amount of time, they should charge them for every day it is late. If the book is damaged, they should charge whoever checked that book out. The book should be in the condition it was in when it left so other people can check it out after it's returned. The library should keep certain books at the library such as the Bible and college books. The library should allow a reasonable number of books to each person. Instead of allowing three or four, this would keep books on the shelves. It would also keep people from losing books. I think people under twenty - one should not be allowed to check out movies or music. I think they should have to show ID to prove they're over twenty - one. There should be more rules than just being quiet in the library. They should make people start keeping books at the library and only allow them to take home a limited number of books. For instance, I check out one book every week and return the one I checked out the same day I go to get a new one. I only check out the book I really want to read and I read it and return it. The magazines should never be checked out. In summary, these rules can help the library function more effectively and ensure that resources are used appropriately.
1263	4240	2	3	I think they shouldn't be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opinions. One person might think a book is offensive, but the next person might not. Some people might think any books with God or Jesus in them are offensive, but that might just be because it is not their religion. If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive, there would be no books left because people think differently. Or some people might not like the horror books because of the violence and goryness, but to some people, those are their favorite books. So, that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others don't. There are many books out there that not everybody's going to like. The difference is how you think and what you think is right and wrong. In conclusion, respecting different opinions about books and keeping them on the shelves allows for a diverse range of reading materials and caters to the varied interests of all readers.
1264	4241	2	3	Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences could be influenced by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries? Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article, that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people might take romances being offensive, or comedy, or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of a relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be not only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself. People of different races and cultures might have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world, there are cultures spreading throughout. Being born into a religion could have a huge impact on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a culture might be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others, it is an opportunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart - breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life. Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protests in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue about what is being put on shelves in libraries, what will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoken out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience. Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no. Every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their lifetime from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture, there would be no history of life before us. In the end, we should accept the diversity of opinions and the value of un - censored library resources.
1265	4242	2	3	We as Americans have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws. If they take away some books because they are racy or because some people find them wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization. A great man once said, 'Those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.' This is saying that if we take away the books that are even considered obscure, we are taking that history away from our children and they will make the same mistakes that we have done in our lives. Taking away the content that is considered obscene will make our children unknowledgeable about the fact that it happened or how the past really was. 'Huckleberry Finn' is under criticism because it uses the 'n - word' a lot in the text. There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked back in the day, and how things were done. If they change the book, they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing. When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how some groups are trying to change the past and how they are trying to deprive the children's history of what really happened. Censorship should be on TV, movies, and music so the little kids don't see the wrong things too early, but when it comes to literature in the library, they shouldn't do it at all because only the literate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying. There should not be a censorship in the literature of the past, the present, and the future. In conclusion, preserving uncensored library literature is crucial for passing on accurate historical knowledge to future generations.
1266	4243	2	3	In my way of viewing things, I firmly say that what I truly think is that the book, movies, music, and magazines should be put in a critical order. This is because among us, some of us earnestly want or genuinely like to read or see stuff about what we specifically want to see, like the news that are, in one way, beneficial to us. However, some others are eager to see what's behind the reality and want to speak up, but they can't because they are deeply afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So, I sincerely think that those things (books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelves. This is because those books or movies can bring to us what's going on in the world and how it is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that I have is with music. I had once heard a song in Spanish called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2', and it vividly talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and how the people from the bottom suffer because the people from the top do not care about them. Also, it emphasizes that if you treat them as kings, they will treat you as a slave, and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take full advantage of it. It shows how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but it's not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for themselves... It's a very good song that tells the truth about it, and yet nobody does anything to end it. So, I don't want songs or books that show the reality to disappear because some people don't like them at all. In conclusion, these forms of media are important as they offer different perspectives and insights, and we should respect the right for them to be available.
1267	4244	2	3	I firmly believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be publicized fairly. Just because one person's view is considered to be right, it doesn't necessarily mean another is wrong. What is offensive to one person might very well be informative to another. I've read a substantial number of books that parents might not pick out for their children. In reading these books, I clearly see that there is no allure in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law. For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they haven't experienced and make them realize that they never want to. If a book is too explicit for children, simply place the book in another section. I fully realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and those should only be permitted to be checked out by adults. Parents should rightfully have concerns about their children's innocence. But I also believe that they should closely watch over what type of books their children are reading to monitor the vulgarity of them. Some @CAPS1 contain profanity or sexual innuendos, some contain praise and worship, others even have screaming. Any of these types of music can be found offensive by someone. That doesn't mean we should run off and hide all of them. Otherwise, there'd be no @CAPS1 left. Not everyone shares the same opinions in this world, therefore there should be equal opportunity for people to read, watch, or listen to whatever suits them. I'm not saying that there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are movies or books about shunned religions or beliefs, then they should be just as welcomed as the ones about common religions and beliefs. Everyone finds different things offensive. If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be removed? It's one of the most popular books in the world, yet some people still find offense by it. Someone who is Mormon, Muslim, or atheist might find it offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find it offensive. The library is a place of knowledge, not judgement. I don't believe that certain books should be removed from the library if they offend someone. If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to, don't let them. It's as simple as that. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech. Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music. In conclusion, we should uphold the principle of equal access to diverse forms of media and respect individual choices.
1268	4245	2	3	I believe that if a book, magazine, movie, etc., has offensive language, then it shouldn't be left on the shelf. Also, it really does matter if it has offensive language because you never know who, where, or when your child is going to learn offensive words. Another thing is that once your child learns these offensive words, he's likely going to say them. Next, one of the most important things is that if you want your child to never have offensive language or engage in any other bad behavior, you should watch what you say and what you do. One reason for this is that as he is growing up, he might follow in your footsteps. Another thing is that if the magazine, movie, book, etc., might have some racist things like judging a person from where he/she comes from, how they look, how they talk, etc., it can end up in a bad situation. For example, it could lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, or a negative impact on your child's perception of others. In conclusion, what I'm trying to say is that it's the responsibility of both parents and the availability of appropriate materials. The book your child has chosen might have bad things, and the parents should watch themselves on how they act. By being vigilant in both areas, we can better protect our children from negative influences.
1269	4246	2	3	Every parent sincerely wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions in a negative way. The truth is, though, that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the @CAPS1. It is ultimately their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material. One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about personal choices. There are a plethora of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people might genuinely want to read or watch something with such content. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to access such topics. Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think certain topics are inappropriate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left. People eventually will not be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that valuable resource. A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What might be offensive to one person might not be to another. How would one decide what should be gotten rid of and what should not? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what is okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that. There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are quite obvious. Censoring libraries is going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropriate and what is not. Eventually, libraries will have nothing left. Of course, every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong. In conclusion, libraries should remain uncensored to preserve freedom of choice and access to diverse information.
1270	4247	2	3	I think censorship of certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be implemented for people who have yet to mature, unless a parent or guardian approves of it. I think censorship can be a positive thing for little children and younger folk because kids that are of a young age should not view or listen to things such as bad language, violent content, or inappropriate themes. These things can have a negative influence on the child's character and personality. For instance, it could lead to behavioral problems or a distorted view of the world. No one should hear other kids cursing in public because this can influence other kids to do the same. I know my parents don't want to hear me say or do bad things around my younger siblings because this can influence them more to do it too than if some random kid was saying or doing bad things. Some censorship shouldn't be imposed on those who are matured, such as in high school where students have to get a signature from a parent to see some things that should not be shown to little kids. This is because older people have matured and they understand why not to be a bad influence on others. They are more likely to make informed decisions and not be negatively affected by such content. Censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be removed from people that have yet to mature, unless with parent consent. People who have not matured should not view or listen to anything that is a negative influence on themselves. In conclusion, censorship is a necessary measure to protect the well - being of young and immature individuals, while still allowing for some access under proper supervision.
1271	4248	2	3	Everyone loves to take their little children to the library and pick out all kinds of books to read. But what if your child picks up that one book that, let's say, just isn't what you want them reading. Then what do you do? Take the book from them? Look for more and just let it be? Well, you cannot blame the library for having the book. Or say you see books you do not like on the shelves at @ORGANIZATION1. Not only books but music or movies. Even if you find it offensive, someone else might not. It should not be a big issue at all because not everyone thinks alike. Some of those books, music, or movies could have great information for others, and also every book, music, or movie has its purpose. Although you @MONTH1 not see it every time it is something that you do not like. Wow, the world would be SO boring if everyone liked the same music, read the same books, or just watched the same movie over and over again. Everyone has the right to choose what they like and enjoy watching, reading, or listening to. The libraries and stores also should have the right to put whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, some things are not appropriate for others, such as younger kids, but it does not matter. You as a parent should do your best to keep them away from those things you do not want them to see or hear. Another thing is that just because you do not like something or think it is stupid does not mean that another person does not love it! Not every average teenage girl is going to want to read about building a house or listen to music from the @NUM1's, but does that mean that stores should not sell them? Everyone has a different taste, just like in music. Most younger kids these days are starting to listen to the fast rap music that their parents swear up and down you cannot understand. Although in reality, some of those songs have great meaning to us teenagers. Lastly, every song, book, or movie has a meaning. Not everyone will see the meaning, but it is there. Everyone has their own opinion. Libraries or stores should not take things off their shelves just because one person thinks that it is inappropriate. In the end, respecting diverse preferences and the freedom of choice is essential for a vibrant and inclusive cultural environment.
1272	4249	2	3	I believe that people should not be able to remove books, movies, magazines, etc. from the shelves of the libraries. If someone finds a movie, book, or magazine offensive, they should contact the author of the piece and can complain or give their thoughts. Even if someone does find someone's work in a wrong way, people have their own opinions and thoughts about everything in life and are allowed to voice their beliefs and disbeliefs. Also, people can read on the front or back of other people's work, which summarizes what the work is going to be about or what the work is talking about. People can decide then if they would like to read or watch further into it. Everyone in this country is allowed to say what they think, and if someone takes the time to get their voice published, then others might want to hear what others think. People can disagree; no one has to agree with anything anyone says. It is alright to not agree with what another person says, but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation. For example, if my coaches were to tell me that they think I'm doing something wrong in gymnastics or they think something doesn't look good when I do it, I let them speak. I let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points. Then after they're done talking, I give my thoughts and say '@CAPS1 I think this because this.' I try to reason with them. For one, it's more respectful, and for two, everyone can have their own thought about something. And who knows, they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak. But, if you really don't like what another piece of work might say, you can always not read what they wrote or watch what they produced. There is no need to be rude. If you strongly disagree, you can always write your own book or publish an article voicing your own thoughts. That way, someone can disagree or agree with how you feel about a certain subject. That is why I feel that they should keep all books, magazines, movies on the shelves. Everyone is allowed to express themselves and explain their actions toward a certain matter. In conclusion, maintaining an open - access environment in libraries respects the diversity of opinions and the right to free expression.
1273	4250	2	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern: The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive. There are many things that could come off as 'offensive' to any individual. Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt that it did not go with their certain morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of speech. It also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas. This also shows that the library, or so far as the country, is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed. One of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away. It @MONTH1 be something as trivial as '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it, then our freedom is taken away. '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' was brought up because a mother had actually gotten a certain book of the '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' @CAPS4 taken off the shelf because her child had gotten scared of the halloween edition. The fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought. There weren't many cases of this specific @PERSON1 scene scaring all the kids, so there was no need to get it banned. When someone finds something even a tad wrong, they want it banned and thrown away, never again allowed to be shown to those that @MONTH1 even find an interest in it. A big thing that @MONTH1 conflict with censorship is the idea of religion. The @CAPS5 is a published work, whether it is religious or not. Who's to say that it can't be banned? What if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive? This could cause even more conflicts between religious parties, and in turn, anything religious would be banned all together. That small, faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship. If the @CAPS5 or works for catholics get banned, then so could published works for wiccans, muslims, buddhists, and any other sources of religion. There would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in. Not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works. It will then become a topic far less talked about, for they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion. This censorship will only cause future issues. This could lead to not only the religious books being banned, but anything that strays from the social norms. If someone was homophobic, they @MONTH1 start having a gay author's works banned, or just a book about the @CAPS7 community banned. That small sense of security those in that community have in those books will be taken away. Personally, I find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books. There @MONTH1 even be a possibility that some books, not necessarily just @CAPS7 books, hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to. It is a world someone loves to enter, to hide or confide in. To take someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety. This censorship, if continued, will erode the very foundation of a free and diverse society. We must resist such attempts to ensure a future where all voices can be heard and all ideas can be explored.
1274	4251	2	3	Devin @NUM1 @NUM2                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2    Do you like the library? There is always an argument about how books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive. Which brings me to @CAPS1 @CAPS2; there is always the choice of a different library to choose from. You also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie. Being an @CAPS3 author, you have the freedom of speech, you can write whatever you feel like writing. First, is your choice of library. There are several different libraries in one town. Some have children sections, where all the books are appropriate for young children to read. Also, the parents of the children need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading or looking at. There has to be at least twenty to thirty libraries in @LOCATION1, so you always have a different option. Second, you don't have to read the book or watch the movie. If you see something you don't like about the book, why complain about it? Just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book. You have the freedom to pick out the book. Last, is the freedom of speech of the author of the book. Being an @CAPS3 citizen, you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down. So people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down. Many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial. Where would we be without those books and authors? I have given you three reasons on @CAPS1 view of censorship in libraries. You have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book, and the author has the freedom to write what they choose. In essence, respecting the rights of both readers and authors is crucial for a healthy and diverse literary environment.
1275	4252	2	3	Hiding @CAPS1?                                                  By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person. @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world, then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right - whatsoever - to close the eyes of another person for them. Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation, or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the responsibility to know the past and use its lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self. People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war, and personal ethics - are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects disappear for another person? In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world, and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the consequences of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day. In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is responsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has the responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions. Embracing the truth, no matter how harsh, is the only way to build a more informed and just society.
1276	4253	2	3	The author, Katherine Paterson, is like trying to let you know that life is going to be okay. Don't be behind; go forward and grab the book from the shelf for you and for your children. Most of the books are gone because other people got them. I would go to the library and grab the book from the shelf for me and my kids. Mom can grab some good books for the kids, like a book that has the parts of the body and grammar so they can start learning something right now that they are little, and they will start to make sentences. On @DATE1 in Warsaw school, the principal decided to remove everything from the library because people didn't go and check out books, music, movies, magazines, etc. He decided to remove them because people didn't check out anything, and most of the people put everything in observation. But my question is, why didn't people check out something for their kids so they can start to read and learn something from their moms at school? In my opinion, if I were the principal of the school, I wouldn't take off the books or anything about the library. I would leave everything so they can grab the books from the shelf and check them out so the kids start to learn how to read. They will learn something special from their mom.
1277	4254	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries, and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit, and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of people's lives, and removing these things can be a big part of someone's development. First off, you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published, and it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes, some books talk about sex, and yes, some books have offensive terms, but unless children are exposed to things like this, they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things, they learn about them, and with a little common sense, they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate, and movies should be looked at in the same manner. Movies nowadays have come a long way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies do contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty, I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front, and I do not think anyone else is okay with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do some things like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult-only section, and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools, and magazines follow that same path. In the world today, we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam-packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see, but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now, I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear, but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this, although can be very offensive maybe to some people, should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help, and they can be those people that help them. Once again, pornography should not be available at any time, but other magazines that have an educational approach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be accessed. Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad, they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way, I can understand why they are taken off the shelves, but other than that, I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people, and taking it away is not the right thing to do. In conclusion, the censorship should not be done. Yes, there are some things that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it, but if things can be learned from, I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn, and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of people's lives, and taking these things from them is not right.
1278	4255	2	3	Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest, I can't remember the last time I walked into a library and found something there that could have offended somebody. But that's just me. I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person. No, I don't think materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out, then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be nobody's business other than the person checking it out. Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelf, but I could imagine that there are people out there that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with, I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others, it's hilarious. All I'm trying to say is just don't get all upset over something that you have read. Everyone has different sensitivities, and what might be offensive to one person may not be to another. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the right of individuals to access information. Libraries are meant to be a source of knowledge and exploration, and by removing materials based on offense, we limit that potential. So, let's be open - minded and not let a little discomfort stop us from the pursuit of knowledge.
1279	4256	2	3	I believe books are written for a reason, and the words in the book go with the whole point of the book. The words in the book are meant to be in the book. But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are too offensive for people to read. But by far, I think not letting people read the books that have offensive wording in it is kinda silly because the author meant for it to be in there, and if you change one word, you kind of are changing the whole book and what it's trying to say. But if some books are too offensive, yes, I believe it is good to not let people read them, but to take it off the market, edit the book, and then try to resell it. But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying something different, but it's not; it is just worded differently. But I believe in both not to stop letting people read them and for them to stay on the market. Why I think it's good to let books like this go on, books that have offensive wording in it, yes, it's wrong, but it's also wrong for the people who don't see it as being offensive. I'm sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didn't mean for it to hurt you. I know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in any way. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wording. It could be about something that happened to them when they were little, or just a word maybe they just dislike. But if they come across any word they don't like, they should stop reading. I believe it is very unfair if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone doesn't like. But to others, it does nothing to them. I think books that have offensive wording should say somewhere, like on the back of the book, it should have a warning if it has any offensive wording in it. I think this would help out a lot of people if they started doing that. This is really kind of silly because a book is a book, and you should always read about the story on the back of the book. And if it's offensive and you don't like it, that tells you not to buy the book. Don't always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it, and the book might not be about flowers at all. I really feel like I'm on both sides. We need to balance the author's intent and the reader's sensibilities. By having warnings, we can give readers the choice, and authors can still express their ideas without completely removing the book from circulation.
1280	4257	2	3	Libraries are a center of learning. They are there to provide all kinds of different information. So why should you take out offensive material? Even before the internet, the all - knowing source, people depended on the library for research. I do not think that things should be taken out of our library. Public libraries have always had a good censory about what they put on their shelves anyway. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' What she is saying is that everybody has a certain opinion, they @MONTH1 take offense to different things. Therefore, if anyone could have the right to take a book off the shelf that they found offensive, then we wouldn't have any books on our shelves. If we would travel back to the time where the internet was not invented, there would not be a problem on whether we should take certain books off the shelf. That's all they depended on, for example, research and entertainment. People today are spoiled. We can go right to a little screen and type in anything we want to know, and we can find out just in minutes, sometimes even seconds. People don't even have to leave the house to go buy the latest movie that just came out; you can order it on the internet or even rent it from @ORGANIZATION1. If people are so worried about what is in the library, why don't they worry about all the explicit junk on the internet? Sometimes people can't see what's right in front of them. Every time I go to the library and look through the books to find something to read, I rarely find a book that's worth questioning. Libraries are typically wholesome corporations; they have a good censory on what they let on their shelves. They've always had certain age - group sections, and usually people and kids always stick to their age groups. Every book I have chosen too, I've read it cover to cover. In conclusion, libraries have been around for ever. Their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages. No matter if we ever had the internet, we always had dependable libraries. Libraries are a reliable and curated source of information, and we should trust their existing systems rather than advocate for unnecessary removal of materials.
1281	4258	2	3	"I think that no @CAPS1, Book, @CAPS2, or any sort of music should ever be taken off the shelf. If you don't like what they say in these @NUM1 categories, don't watch, listen, read, or do anything related to them. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean somebody else doesn't. I mean, think about it. Is there a @CAPS1 or a song or a sentence that's so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf? I say no. Also, because somebody might have not got the chance to read, see, or listen to that @CAPS1, song, or book. You know what I mean. Plus, all that money, time, and hard work it took to make the song, book, or @CAPS1. It takes up to like almost @NUM2 years for a @CAPS1 to come out. And when a song comes out, you hardly even know it's new because they never tell you, like ""listen to Bullet for My Valentine's new song on @NUM3"" or anything. And when a new book comes out, it's usually like Harry Potter or something like that. But no, no @CAPS1 should ever be taken off the shelves, nor books, nor music, nor magazines. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of creative works and let people make their own choices about what they consume. @ORGANIZATION1."
1282	4259	2	3	There are certain books, games, and music that you and I know that shouldn't be in the library or stores on the shelves. One word that we should study, children. Children are the future, and everything that happens in the future will be because of them. Now, with that done and said, I would like to explain and point out why we as people of @ORGANIZATION1 should overcome together and take books, music, movies off the shelves. Drugs, crime, violence, movies, and etc. Rappers most of the time rap about females, killing people, and etc. It doesn't mean that they do it, but it reflects on the majority of our children. Music is heard every day @NUM1 hours throughout television, radio, and iPods. It takes it to an even different level with the male gender, calling females out of their names and treating them as they were taught through music. If they're not listening to it, they're for sure watching it. A lot of the problems come from letting children watch the wrong - rated movies. Rated @CAPS1 is what they are now letting children watch and buy. So now it's giving them a greater chance of failing in life. So now we're at two strikes with this stuff that we're allowing our children to pick up off a shelf. The other thing we let them pick up and grab is video games. @PERCENT1 of our children play video games. While at the same time as we can't stop them from making them, I strongly believe we can prevent children from buying them at the wrong age level. Most of the games are based on sex, drugs, violence, and bad language. At this point, children are taking it very seriously and strongly believing they can do the same, which leads to death or jail. Drug use, school dropouts, and crime rates are high because of these same video games children are getting off the shelf, strongly influencing them to grow up fast and skip over the childhood life. So why can't we do it? I don't understand why we can't do it when we have the power to. It will help us out so much for everybody's future. Crime rates will go down, test scores will improve, and our future will be brighter. For our sake and our children's, we must take action to protect them from such harmful media.
1283	4260	2	3	Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you. You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf, so you take it off. I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf. It isn't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazines, or many others. The authors have the right of freedom of speech, but it can go the other way around too. There are many reasons why, and I will explain this to you. The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place. I mean, if somebody walks into a library and tries to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one? A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offensive. It was making jokes about black people. I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe. The next reason is that it could cause the rating of the materials to go down. If somebody gets offended about a censored material, they are going to report it and cause the rating to drop low. No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and that nobody wants. How would the author feel about their material getting reported because of somebody getting offended by it? If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it. The last reason is to get rid of the materials. Nobody wants to look at something that offends them. How would you feel if you took a movie home to watch with the family and it had bad stuff in it and you didn't like it? You get offended and complain. Complaining is bad for business, especially if it's a government - run building. If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from public spaces is a reasonable step to ensure a positive and inclusive environment for all. I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if somebody is offended by it. There are really three main reasons. One is that the person might never come back to that place. Next, is that it could cause the rate of success to drop down low. The last is to just get rid of the materials so there are no complaints. Now, what do you believe?
1284	4261	2	3	I believe that censorship within libraries and any other public media source is wrong, immoral, and unfair. Authors, artists, photographers, etc. have the right to freedom of speech. Why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? The censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it goes against basic American rights, but it also takes the responsibility, originality, and expression out of @CAPS1' lives. If a parent or guardian did not wish for their child to be exposed to certain genres of certain media, isn't it their responsibility to intercept that from their child's environment? If a parent really abhors a certain genre, then it is up to that parent to create a surrounding in which they feel that their child is safe. It is understandable that some genres of music, magazines, books, and movies contain material that @MONTH1 be too graphic or mature for readers of a certain age, but situations like this in today's world are unavoidable. In my experience, I know that when I was too young to understand the happenings of @NUM1, my parents intercepted the stories from me. My parents turned off graphic or violent television when I walked in the room. They felt that this sort of material was inappropriate for someone at age @NUM2, so they removed that material from my environment. When you become a parent, you take on responsibility for the life of another person. This responsibility includes the child's health, safety, and his/her surroundings. Why can't @LOCATION1 leave the parenting of children to the parents? When children turn into teenagers and teenagers become adults, they earn many privileges. They earn the right to drive, then the right to vote, then the right to drink responsibly. There is a maturity level that goes into making decisions on your own. If you are mature enough to decide who you want to run your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as insignificant as music choice? Authors, artists, composers, and photographers, all by living in @LOCATION1, all have the right to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. By censoring what products are published and put in public takes away that right. Some @MONTH1 argue that the artists and authors still have the right to express themselves, but they are expressing material that is too risque or graphic to promote. This is an understandable point, but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote? Why should the government have total control over what @CAPS1 are exposed to? If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power - hungry politicians? Wouldn't @LOCATION1 no longer be a democracy, but rather a communist country, like @LOCATION2? American prides itself in being a'mixing pot' and being accepting. If @LOCATION1 were to be like @LOCATION2, that would mean the restriction of expression and originality throughout the country. Would you really want to live in a country where originality isn't really original, and acceptance was only what the government decided was acceptable? Would you be proud to live in a place where people don't have the opportunity to express themselves to others freely? I wouldn't. Although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale, but censorship is censorship. It is discrimination against composers of a certain genre of works. It is the removal of choice from @CAPS1' lives. It is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech. Whichever way you look at it, censorship is censorship, and censorship is wrong. In conclusion, we should uphold the principles of freedom of speech and choice, and oppose any form of unjust censorship in public media sources.
1285	4262	2	3	Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music, movies, and other things for entertainment. Mainly children use the library more than any other age group. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check out things that are offensive in any type of way. Not even books that will influence bad things. Therefore, certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries. Certain movies shouldn't be in the library. For example, if a child goes to the library, they @MONTH1 see a movie that contains sexual activity and decide to check the movie out. The kid @MONTH1 be underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate. The child @MONTH1 get in trouble by their guardian. In reality, it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out. That is why the movies should be censored. On the cover of many magazines, women as well as men's bodies are exposed. That @MONTH1 cause children to be attracted to the magazine. They @MONTH1 even decide to check the magazine out. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example. In today's world, all children listen to music. The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life. The music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourages you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion, only influential music should be able to be rented out. Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you. Not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should only have history, math, and educational books. In conclusion, everything in the library should be censored. A lot of children use the library. Therefore, it should be age - appropriate. No child needs to be put under a bad influence. Certain things should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion and to ensure that the library remains a safe and positive place for all children to learn and grow.
1286	4263	2	3	I think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some inappropriate stuff in them that little kids could accidentally look at or watch. The movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids wrong ideas, and the books should be removed because they have some vulgar words that people shouldn't be saying. The music should be removed because they often have rap music. People shouldn't be listening to such music. The music is sometimes not appropriate for all ages and it can give people some bad ideas of what they say or do. The books and magazines can give people some wrong ideas of what they say or do and they might blindly believe anything of what they say. People should be reading good books and good magazines and listening to some decent music. They are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff, like doing drugs or engaging in violence, or talk about how they live their immoral lives. People shouldn't be listening to some rap music or reading the inappropriate magazines or books that will give other people bad ideas. The books sometimes talk about what happened a long time ago in a way that offends people. The magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past in a negative light and then people don't want to read any magazines anymore. The people don't want to listen to any music anymore or read any books anymore. Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music with such content are bad for the kids and for the adults. I think that it is offensive because music like rap or hip - hop often contains inappropriate lyrics. The people shouldn't be listening to rock music with bad lyrics either and they should just listen to some music that is appropriate. The books should be appropriate for all ages and they should read something that they like and that is positive. They should read some magazines that they like and that are good and appropriate. The music is offensive because they talk about inappropriate stuff and they shouldn't be listening to it. The magazines have some inappropriate pictures and stories, and the books have some inappropriate descriptions. The people won't like it and they might not want to check it out again or they won't check anything out. I think that they should put some good books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will enjoy. They should put some decent magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read. In conclusion, by removing offensive media and replacing them with positive ones, we can create a healthier reading and listening environment for everyone.
1287	4264	2	3	I feel that this test is stupid. I really hate reading and writing. I think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level because a lot of kids aren't even going to really try on this test until like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year. Also, a lot of teachers don't even teach this material until the end of the year. So, I think that some of the stuff that you all test on should be changed, like the specific topics you test on and how long the test is. It should be more focused on reading and writing levels. However, I do agree that the test should still be here because it helps filter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work. I think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper because some kids test better on paper than on a computer. This is the way I feel about the test. I know I was supposed to write about offensive material but I couldn't think how I felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mind, so I thought I would inform you. Thank you very much. In conclusion, making these changes to the test can better assess students' true abilities and provide a fairer testing environment.
1288	4265	2	3	In libraries, there are of course books. There are mysteries, full of suspense and unexpected twists, romances, filled with tender love stories, comics, with their vivid illustrations, biographies, offering insights into real - life figures, and anything else that you @MONTH1 be able to think of. There are also magazines, with various topics from fashion to science, movies, presenting different stories on the big screen, and even cd's, which contain music and audio materials, that are at the libraries now. Then at libraries there are also those books and magazines. Those books being the ones I would never pick up off of the shelf myself, let alone allow my future children to pick up. This is because those books contain material that is not at all conducive to the young person's brain. That is why I would like those books to be censored so my child would never even know that the books are there. These books have in them people having sex, described in explicit detail, and smoking drugs, with all the negative consequences ignored, and their language in these books is horrifying! These seem to be the kinds of books that young children have become interested in. They read them at school and get them somehow from their friends. They also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to imitate because they are influenced very easily. They are influenced by book characters that don't even exist some of the time. There are many reasons of why I feel that the books should be censored but one of the biggest reasons is that because young people read these kinds of books they go out and do what they read in the books. Thinking it's okay because somebody that is not even real, most of the time, is doing it. I feel that these books are the reason that babies are raising babies, children that are ten are going out having sex and getting pregnant and becoming eleven - year - old mothers. Where is that even heard of, but it happens and by the time those same children become freshmen in high school, if they even get there, they are carrying the responsibility of the baby they had when they were eleven. Those same children go through life wondering how different their situations could have been! So I feel like before these books go and mess up a whole other generation of children why don't we stop it here? Why does another child have to get pregnant at the age of ten for someone else to realize it's time to change things? Ten - year - old children are still just babies! The human brain isn't even fully developed until you are in around the age of twenty - five. So these children don't know if what they are reading is wrong because they haven't been taught that it is very wrong. This is because at that age no parent expects that they will have to teach their child not to have sex. Why you @MONTH1 ask, because at the age of ten what child should know about sex? At that age they still like to color and play with baby dolls or they like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, they shouldn't even be thinking about sex let alone know what it is. These materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening. To stop yet another generation from messing up their lives taking the materials off is the best solution. After all, shouldn't a parent get the chance to make sure their child isn't killing their chances to live a happy life in the future? In conclusion, censoring inappropriate books in libraries is a necessary step to protect the well - being of young generations.
1289	4266	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that I have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, I do not believe that everyone else shouldn't be able to get the books they want because of content issues. One reason why I think there shouldn't be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet. If students in high school or college don't have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work because they're trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working. Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is a problem is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one that's close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole research for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. Some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they don't like something, they shouldn't check it out in the first place. There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions upon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to research or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries. If people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter. In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible. By removing unnecessary censorship, we can ensure that people have access to the information they need and can freely explore their interests.
1290	4267	2	3	Imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive. In this library you wouldn't find many of the great pieces of literature that have impacted and influenced society @DATE1. You probably wouldn't find too many books, magazines, or movies that everyone in the @CAPS1 feels that are appropriate. Some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people. Offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1 because something that is offensive to one person might not be to another person, who could be impacted by the piece of literature that is being banned. Music should also remain in libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to bring the listeners' attention to the offensive material. Also offensive materials have made an impact in society for ages. First, materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material. Some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people, but many others @MONTH1 enjoy the movie for its unique plot and humor. If a movie, book, or magazine has the topic of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, it could be considered offensive to people who were a part of it, but it could also inform the reader or the person who is watching about the events that happened in a more comprehensive way. If children want to see or read this material they should get permission from their parents first. Next, all music should remain in libraries. The music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment. The purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners. The lyrics in some songs are inappropriate for children, but parents should take the responsibility and not let their child listen to them. Lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults. Last, offensive materials have impacted society for ages. Many things the founding fathers of the @LOCATION1 did were considered offensive at that time, but that did not make them wrong, and it made the @CAPS1 a better place @DATE1. Offensive materials impact everyday life for better and worse. If all offensive materials were banned, they wouldn't be able to have an impact on @CAPS1 for better. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1. The materials @MONTH1 be controversial, but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the @CAPS1. Offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people. The @CAPS1 would turn into that of the @CAPS1 in @PERSON1's novel @CAPS4 @NUM1, where all books were burned and society was not intelligent at all, if offensive materials were taken out of libraries @DATE1. By keeping offensive materials in libraries, we can ensure a diverse and comprehensive cultural environment that allows for growth and learning.
1291	4268	2	3	I think that some books which contain offensive content or use derogatory words against people should be banned from libraries. Specifically, this should apply to high - school libraries. It doesn't matter as much in elementary schools because young students wouldn't understand the implications of some things. For instance, if a class were to read an offensive book and there's someone in the class from the opposite race of what's described in the book, others could get offended and it might start a fight. Some high - schoolers are more sensitive and can get offended quicker, which could cause a lot of problems. So, to avoid such issues, there should be votes on which books should be banned and not be allowed to be read in class or in school at all. I know people might think it's dumb to ban books, but trust me, it would solve a lot of problems. It all comes down to determining what's acceptable and what's not without hurting other people's feelings and putting them down. I'm sure that in classes, there have been stories read that talk about races, making some students uncomfortable. There's always that one person who tries to make fun of things. If I were in this situation, I'd try my best not to let others affect my grades and performance. I'd ignore them as much as possible. If it got annoying, I'd talk to my counselor about either having a talk with that person individually or getting myself removed from the class. I'm pretty sure most schools wouldn't tolerate this kind of behavior, but there will always be such kids, and you just have to ignore them. You should never skip school thinking you don't fit in just because someone is making fun of your race or appearance. They're just trying to make your day harder. All you have to do is ignore them or report it, and hopefully, it will be taken care of. In conclusion, by taking steps like book - banning votes and handling offensive situations properly, we can create a more harmonious school environment.
1292	4269	2	3	Censorship in libraries varies in different areas. I'm an avid reader and love all kinds of books. I've read some books that my parents wouldn't approve of, but that hasn't really stopped me. I think that after reaching a certain age, people should be allowed to read whatever they want. I mean, if I feel I'm not mature enough to read a particular book, I simply won't get or read it. It's that straightforward. When it comes to music, movies, and magazines, it could be a different story. Music, for the most part, is similar to a book, just appealing to a different sense as it's listened to rather than read. Movies, in my view, should be judged more carefully. They're like a form of show - and - tell, and things could easily go wrong if children, teens, etc., take them too seriously. I believe all things shouldn't be judged based on assumptions. Everyone has different opinions and preferences. So, material shouldn't be removed from shelves if there are people who like or support what the book, movie, or music has to offer. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship, considering individual maturity and diverse interests, is the key to a well - functioning library and media environment.
1293	4270	2	3	What's your first thought when you think about a library? Is it the quietness, peace, or calm? Many people would think so until they come across a certain book, magazine, movie, etc. They start reading and soon encounter something completely offensive. Books, magazines, movies, etc., should be censored and removed from a library if found offensive. Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I believe a library is a place of peace. Having offensive literature in a library makes it seem a bit shabby. If people want to read a magazine or book that offends a large number of people, they should go elsewhere. When I was younger, I participated in events at our local library, like seeing who could read the most books over a certain period or other similar events. I loved exploring the library and finding new things. I remember, back then and still today, there were always many magazines on the shelves, neatly categorized. Many of them showed half - dressed women and men. I understand that people want to stay informed about the real world, but I think they can find such magazines elsewhere. Having these offensive magazines in libraries where children can see them is not good and could easily upset parents. Another reason for censoring books, magazines, etc., is that they can influence teens to do wrong or bad things. For example, many books talk about drugs and smoking. If teens read this, they might start thinking it's not wrong to do these things. If such books were removed from libraries, I believe the number of bad influences on teens would be greatly reduced as they won't read them. In my opinion, libraries would be better if books, magazines, movies, etc., were censored. It would not only make people happier but also contribute to a better world. After all, if you're looking to read something inappropriate, a library isn't the place. In conclusion, censoring offensive materials in libraries is essential for maintaining a positive and healthy environment for all users.
1294	4271	2	3	My views on censorship are quite strong. I think that if a book, movie, etc., is discriminatory towards one or more groups of people, then people should at least have a say in whether it should be on the library shelves. Although books can be discriminatory, if a book is about something that happened in the past and is part of our country's history, people should also have a say in keeping it on the shelves. If these materials use offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against a race, they should be taken off the shelves. However, if they are part of the world's or our country's history, they should be left there for future generations to learn about and to know that such things occurred. Most materials don't aim to discriminate against any race, and if they did, they probably wouldn't be in the library in the first place. For me, censorship can go either way. It really depends on the situation and the material. Someone might think something is offensive, but that doesn't make it a fact. If a book is popular in the library and many people like to come and read it, I don't think I'd remove it. People perceive offensive writing and actions differently. So, it truly depends on the situation. If I were a parent today, I'd let my child read one of these so - called offensive books if it was part of our country's past. My intention for letting him read it is for all the right reasons. I don't want him to act on the things described in the book. I'd let him read it to learn about the past. I think it's a positive thing for children to know about history. In conclusion, censorship is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the material and the context, and my views are just my opinion on this multifaceted topic.
1295	4272	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't believe this for several reasons. If anyone could take books off the library shelves, libraries would lose their purpose. Students in school would have a harder time learning about certain topics in the world. It would also defeat the purpose of having freedom of speech, but we can easily avoid this problem if needed. One reason I oppose taking books off the shelves is that if everyone had the right to remove books they find offensive, there would soon be no books left. This would limit students' ability to learn about many important topics. Just the other day, I heard a lady telling her daughter that she wouldn't let her go to school on the day of'sex education' in grade six because she thought her daughter was too young. While that might be true, it also means her daughter won't learn about the many diseases that can result from underage or unprotected sex. This could lead her daughter to have sex at a young age, get pregnant, or contract a disease that could have been prevented with a little education from library books or a school class. Another reason I don't support taking books from the shelves is that when we do so, we're discarding someone's hard work. In my opinion, it's very disrespectful to the authors and everyone involved in writing those books. Just because you don't agree with the content doesn't mean you can throw it away. This defeats the purpose of freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is essentially telling the authors that they can't write about what they want and publish it, and that they can't express their opinions. This problem can be easily solved. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magazines, etc., could be placed in a separate section of the library and only made available to adults of a certain age. Rate the books and other writing pieces in the same way as movies. This would be a simple and effective solution. As I mentioned earlier, I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to remove certain materials if they find them offensive. It can affect the community, is disrespectful to the authors, and there are simple solutions. In conclusion, we should find a balance that respects freedom of speech and provides access to knowledge while addressing concerns about offensive materials.
1296	4273	2	3	Yes, I firmly believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are blatantly offensive and inappropriate. People should indeed have the freedom of speech, but it must not be exercised in an offensive manner. If individuals want their creations, such as movies to be watched or music to be heard, it should be appropriate for public consumption. Just because other people are producing and promoting offensive content doesn't make it right. Some people, especially the more impressionable ones, have little sense of judgment and might imitate the things that movies or songs depict. Most people are drawn to certain songs because they advocate doing bad things; they just want to be heard or gain attention. When I listened to such music or watched those kinds of movies, I got the same misguided ideas as other kids my age and younger. I ended up doing stupid stuff because I naively thought that it was the right thing to do. People just want to get their voice out there and be heard. I learned that to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate manner. Some artists or actors don't want to convey these negative messages to kids, but the only way they think they can get their work out to the public is to make it offensive. I stopped reading and watching this inappropriate stuff because I learned the hard way. The only way that I will be heard and respected is to say and do the appropriate things. The way I look at things is that we should all strive for a more positive and appropriate cultural environment.
1297	4274	2	3	Censorship has been around for quite a while, and a significant number of people agree that there should be censorship on a wide range of things, like television, books, magazines, almost about everything. However, some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens. They are not little kids anymore, and they shouldn't have everything censored. For instance, when you go to see a rated @CAPS1 movie, and you have to be accompanied by an adult to watch that movie. For little kids, I strongly think that they should have things censored because they are young and innocent. They simply don't need to be exposed to bad language and other inappropriate content. Parents should also take an active interest in what their child hears or reads if they are young. Unfortunately, some parents don't even care what their kids see or hear, and these kids end up getting in trouble with their teachers if they repeat the offensive words. It seems like the younger kids are always picking up bad language or bad habits, and I think it's truly sad because they shouldn't be around such negative influences. They absorb a lot of stuff when they are young, so adults are like role models for them. I believe that older teens, like @NUM1 and @NUM2, are more mature about this. If they read a book in the library that might have a bad word, I'm sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when they are in town. They are going to hear it anyway, so why try to stop it when they are going to end up hearing it eventually. Books are supposed to help you and give you a realistic view of the world. You can't just throw out books or censor them without good reason. Everybody has their different opinion, and this is my opinion. When you reach a certain age, you start to mature and realize that those are bad things to say or do. So, I firmly believe that high school books, magazines, or anything else shouldn't be overly censored.
1298	4275	2	3	Imagine, you walk into your favorite library with excitement, looking forward to grabbing your favorite book or movie, but it's not there. The librarian informs you that the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive. Would this not get on your nerves? Especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it. Sure, there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material; but why remove them completely? There are plenty of alternative solutions that could satisfy everyone. Such as having a restricted section only adults are allowed into, having a separate public place for adults to access the books, movies, etc., and having signed permission from a parent or guardian stating that their child could check out certain items. The first solution is to have certain offensive material under strict lock and key from the general public. If only the librarian had access to this material, a child could not simply walk in and borrow what he or she deems fit. The librarian would be the only one authorized to judge if the person, whether a child or an adult, could access this section of the library. Next, there could be a totally separate building dedicated to the offensive material. Only people over @NUM1 would be permitted to enter, and you would have to present an ID and a library card to gain access. This would ensure that no one underage could obtain or take anything that was deemed inappropriate. My last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage. When the child comes to get a library card, the parent must be present and fill out a detailed application specifying what the child can and cannot check out. I do not believe that books, movies, music, etc., should be removed from shelves. This directly violates the first amendment, the right to free speech. If a person can dictate what someone else can or cannot read, see, or listen to, what's to stop them from taking away every @CAPS1 given right we have? What's to stop them from censoring everything we write and say? Would you want to live in a world like that? I would most certainly not! However, I also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material. I believe these are good alternatives to prevent this from happening if only we take the necessary steps to implement them.
1299	4276	2	3	What other people take as offensive might be deeply valued by others. I whole - heartedly believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should remain on the shelves at the library. People cherish many different things, and we need to give others an opportunity to explore the diverse range of available content. Different types of books explain different aspects of life. Some people connect with books in a way that others might not understand. Taking certain types of books away can hurt other people's feelings and limit their intellectual growth. Taking music away, in my opinion, would be the worst. People often get lost in some types of music; they use it as an escape from their problems. Taking that away can leave them feeling helpless and alone. People love movies because they help them understand what is going on from other people's points of view. Taking away movies could deprive people of a valuable form of entertainment and learning. People have different movie preferences, and some movies can be offensive. But it's not up to anyone else to decide what others can watch. Magazines help people keep up with the latest news. Most of the news can be very offensive, but it is the real - world events and the actions of the people around us that cause such news. Taking away magazines can prevent people from staying informed about the latest gossip and important news. Taking away things that people use to connect with, to escape, for entertainment, and for news would most likely cause people to act out in a negative way. Everybody is different, and everybody likes different things. Taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people who think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel? We should respect everyone's right to access the content they value.
1300	4277	2	3	The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2'. Do these titles sound familiar? They should, because these are only a tiny fraction of the numerous @CAPS3 literary masterpieces that people have enjoyed since their publications. These wonderful books also share another characteristic: they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world. When a child goes off to school each day, his or her parents are left with the expectation that the child will receive a quality education that aligns with their own core values and morals. But certain parents may become outraged when they see the books shelved in the school library that they consider wrong. They don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right. In all reality though, how is this helping anyone? By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn. By censoring things, people are not only shielded from ideas that might shock them but also from ideas that might stimulate their thinking. If a person cannot think independently, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things. When one cannot think for oneself or make decisions for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual? Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think. By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking freely and exploring different ideas. And when you want a book removed from a school library, you are not only preventing your child from reading this book but also everyone who goes to the school. How is that fair? So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your child's school, I say this. Teach your children to be discerning in what they read. If you don't want them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', tell them not to read that book. Guide your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow. If certain books seem to lead them away from having their own thoughts instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't impose your views on everyone else. We should encourage independent thinking and respect the diversity of literary works.
1301	4278	2	3	Certain books should be removed from the library because of the materials and the inappropriate stuff they show to younger children. One reason they should take those books off is because some of them are blatantly racist against some cultures. Such books can have derogatory terms and negative stereotypes that can teach young children the wrong things. They can also teach the children to treat people differently just because they are reading those books from the library. Moreover, they would give the children the wrong idea about people and different cultures. Another reason is that some of the books, movies, etc., would have content that young children shouldn't be looking at or reading. For example, they shouldn't have movies with graphic killing, drug - dealing scenes, or about excessive drinking or anything a child shouldn't be exposed to. It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think it's okay because they saw it in the movies or read it in a book. A final reason is that some books just shouldn't be in the libraries at all. Or there should be a place where young kids can't access them. They would need a parent or someone who is eighteen so that they wouldn't be able to just get these bad books or movies. In conclusion, libraries shouldn't have books, music, magazines, or movies with such inappropriate content. They give kids wrong ideas and make them think that it's cool or the right thing to do because they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That doesn't make it the right thing to do, which is why they should get rid of that stuff.
1302	4279	2	3	Keep it on the shelves. The reason for libraries is so that people can read what they want to read. If I owned a library, I would have everything on the shelves because there are a lot of people, and not everyone likes the same thing. Truthfully, I wouldn't care because it isn't just about a handful of people; it is about everyone's feelings. If people started taking certain things out of bookstores and libraries, it would eventually get out of hand. The reason it would get out of hand is because of a certain topic like slavery. If someone wanted to learn about it or enjoyed reading topics like that, it wouldn't be fair. While some people might find it offensive to put stuff out there for the public like that, everyone has their own opinion. But why express your own opinion if the subject you want to express it under isn't harming anyone physically or emotionally? If everyone's opinion was heard and taken into consideration, the world as we know it would be boring and outrageous. People like action and adventures, others like laid - back kind of stuff. Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if it's just going to start a conflict and change the way people live their everyday life? Maybe it could turn out in a good way, but really what are the chances of that? A billion to a thousand. Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others, so keep everything on the shelves. If only certain people are going to complain about it, it's not really a big deal. Maybe someday when everyone in the world agrees on valid reasoning, then we could change it, but I really don't see that happening anytime soon. The main reason is there is always going to be conflict between two or more groups of people. Everyone can't be happy at the same time. I say who cares whether something offends someone or not; that's their opinion, and until a lot more people are concerned, the items can stay on the shelf for the people that actually enjoy that kind of stuff.
1303	4280	2	3	Books? Movies? Music? Magazines? We all like to read them, watch them, and listen to them. It's hard to stop all that. Plus, it's impossible to stop. Everywhere you go, you can find these items. Such as the movie store, the mall, a gas station, a yard sale, and even your public library. People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book, movie, a song, or a magazine, and it's perfectly fine. But, there is one problem. Censorship. Yes, that's what I said, 'censorship.' It means a lot to some parents when it comes to their children. Especially when it comes to the public library where they live. If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books, movies, or etc., that's okay. But if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine having 'bad things' in it that children shouldn't see, it's a problem. They want to be able to enjoy the movie, song, or magazine with their children, but bad things like nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity can be really offensive to parents and people in general, not just parents. A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone, and censorship is a pretty good idea. There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at, watch, or read any 'bad things' because we all know that is not right. Kids are young and don't need to be learning about that stuff at a young age. I think censoring is a really great idea, and I think libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should censor their things. But if they won't censor anything, they should at least put them in categories such as 'adults,' 'young adults,' or 'kids.' If they categorize the ratings, then the parents will know where to look and don't have to worry about censorship. Censorship should be practiced everywhere.
1304	4281	2	3	Corrupt Censorship. Issues occur when censorship decides to remove or block, showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor, and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made. Instead, from their own habit of making what they enjoy, it is the will from the store, person, or etc., to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the educational rules the library is equipped with. Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite, or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not allowed to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing, on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice. Libraries, for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criteria. In some instances, a partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecutable persuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creator's fault to ensure where their content is displayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is a choice to read or see whatever you'd like; you aren't forced upon to follow through with what the distributor, let alone the creator, is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional. When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it is your will to choose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more difficult, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isn't up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content, and it isn't your obligation to view it. When you take down materials that are intended for those who choose to view and enjoy, you destroy not only the art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewer's taste. Libraries shouldn't exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
1305	4282	2	3	Nowadays, people can get offended over anything. In today's trying times, readers, listeners, and even writers are trying to get what they want, not what the consumer wants. Even though some stories, books, or articles are completely bogus, it shouldn't matter. Don't let others' opinions ruin it for everyone else. Many people get offended nowadays over absolutely nothing, and they feel the need to do something about it. Which necessarily isn't a bad thing but isn't a good thing either. It is freedom of speech, or so that's what the constitution says, meaning folks have the right to read, write, or say anything they please. Fake and bogus writings are a small problem to readers and writers. People are reading articles and books and believing every bit of what they read, write, or even hear on their radio in recent times. It is hard to believe anything nowadays because you never really know the facts unless you experience them yourself. Opinions are the big thing folks have to look out for, but still, that goes back to the freedom of speech. Reading and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human will ever know. Just don't let other readers' opinions get in the way of a great thing. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of speech and not let baseless offense and personal opinions limit the availability of diverse written materials.
1306	4283	2	3	Controversey and @CAPS1     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controversial.     The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five - year - olds, but for desparate sex - crazed men, and @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, like children's picture books, wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative.      It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and utterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree. Some religions think the @CAPS4 series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversy fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices.      Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the @ORGANIZATION1 books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That made me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as @CAPS5 vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's.     If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own.      All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts. In the end, a balance between parental guidance and personal freedom is essential for a child's healthy development.
1307	4284	2	3	No, I do not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason. Sure, some things might not be appropriate for certain people or age groups, but everyone is going to eventually hear, see, or be involved in something they are not supposed to like, enjoy, or agree with. In a library, which is a place of diverse knowledge, people should have the opportunity to encounter different ideas. Censorship would limit this exposure and go against the very essence of free - thinking. Instead of censoring, we should educate people, especially the young, on how to handle and evaluate different types of information. So, in conclusion, libraries should remain a space where freedom of access to information is upheld, allowing individuals to make their own informed choices.
1308	4285	2	3	Do people take offensive books seriously? There are lots of stuff in books that people @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people @MONTH1 think differently. I'm pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not, people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways.     I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them. They also see what their mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.     In the paragraph I wrote before this, I said that children see things that their mentor and parents are doing. Now, today in the @NUM1 century, parents really don't keep a good eye on things and what they leave out for what their child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want their child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library, then they should watch what their kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.     I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world than it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older, they are going to end up seeing things that they couldn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.     We shouldn't take books offensive. After all, they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of the library. Besides, some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly. In the end, it's about personal responsibility and the ability to distinguish between what is acceptable and what isn't, rather than trying to censor every potentially offensive item in the library.
1309	4286	2	3	I think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves. If a book, magazine, movie, etc, is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it. Don't go back and keep looking at it because what you find offensive someone else might like.      The world won't change around you, so you should do the smart thing and ignore it. If something is found offensive on censorship in libraries, then maybe it's not a good idea for you to be where you are in that library. And if something does offend you, you should still act appropriately and deal with the situation the right way.     When I was younger, I used to see books with a cover titled @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc., and would think it was funny, but the adults didn't think so. The books are put there for people to read not just to look at. The books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way.  If you find something offensive then you should just move away from that area, so that you won't worry about having to be offended.      Different people like different things, so they will have many different varieties to choose from in a library. They might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like. You have to make a wise choice and know that if something is going to offend you stay away from it.     Censorship in libraries have every right to put up any and every piece of book, music, movie, magazine, etc., because it is in their facility. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended by anything they put up. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended because @PERCENT1 of the time the things they put up are not bad at all, 'it @MONTH1 even be helpful,' but to one person it @MONTH1 be harmful or offend them.     In @CAPS5, censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want. If you're offended/not offended they have every right to shelve whatever it is. Because in the real world, you don't always get what you want, and you won't always like what you see. So, we should respect the library's right to curate its collection and make our own choices about what to engage with.
1310	4287	2	3	A library is a safe haven. A place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book. It is a place filled with knowledge and information. You can find information on anything in a library, from any point of view. Information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive.     A library should not be biased. Removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge. Whether or not something is offensive, the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses. Having information in a library that @MONTH1 be offensive does not mean a person is obliged to read it. Katherine Paterson brings up a good point when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...and you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. If everyone could remove a book that offended them, there would be no books left.      There are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others' points of views. For example, there are many different religions in the world. Many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points @MONTH1 offend each other. That does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion @MONTH1 be offended. Every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others' religions. If we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated world.     A library is a place of education and learning. It is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses. If libraries censored information, then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased. It would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore, no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world. One could not go to a library and get different points of views on every subject. Censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing. In conclusion, maintaining an uncensored library is crucial for the free flow of knowledge and the development of an informed and well - rounded society.
1311	4288	2	3	Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are numerous things that shouldn't be exposed to children, such as sexism, racism, deranged @CAPS3, and pornography. So, I am here today to tell you all about these things. First off, books that contain racist comments should not be accessible to our young children. Why? Because it sets a bad example for them, and they might think they can say and do the things depicted in the book. Another concerning aspect is sex in books. I'm sure you've read stories that discuss sex, how to do it, and all sorts of related things. In summary, such books shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. The second thing that shouldn't be permitted in public libraries is @CAPS2 - @CAPS3 movies. This includes things like horror movies, porn, and many more. Young children should not be exposed to these kinds of things because it can damage their minds at a young age. It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older. The last reason why I believe many things shouldn't be in the libraries is the @CAPS4 magazines. Those magazines display all sorts of naked photos. These really don't need to be exposed to our young children. Our little girls might think it's okay for them to take naked photos of themselves and post them in books and on the internet. So, all in all, all of these things should be banned from the libraries for many different reasons. The @LOCATION1 should seriously consider what I am saying. Just think if it were your own children being exposed to inappropriate things. It's our responsibility to protect them from such content in the library environment.
1312	4289	2	3	As a small child, I vividly remember my mom reading me stories to put me to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most, named 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1. The other day, as I was walking into my public library, I noticed the books that had been censored because they were said to encourage the following: mistreating parents, using offensive language, developing bad habits, and other such things. I was really mad that this book had, essentially, been erased from all of children's literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it, though. When you are a child, either having a book read to you or reading one yourself, do you honestly pay attention to such small details? I do not think that books and music should be censored because society generally does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but I feel that censorship goes too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, I do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when I read that book today, I still do not see any of the reasons that were listed as justifications for its censorship. Therefore, I believe that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of children who deserve to hear and read it. Over the years, many things have been censored. Some had an actual valid reason, while others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they interpreted the book. The point is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give a clear indication saying that there is potentially inappropriate material in that certain book and it should not be read to or by a certain age group. When you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been censored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I firmly believe there should not be any censorship. It's important to preserve the freedom of access to diverse literary works.
1313	4290	2	3	Almost every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library. It is a place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines, and more. Inside a library, there are different well - defined sections. There are kids' sections, adult sections, fiction sections, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not suitable for children. A common question has been coming up in everyday life: 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?' Libraries have been around for years, and so have uncensored things that are sometimes put in front of children. As a child, you have a natural curiosity to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be presented as an obstacle for you to make the right choice, just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. It is made for everyone's access, and not everyone is alike. Therefore, there is plenty of variety in these libraries. In my belief, it should never be a library's fault for containing things not appropriate for children. Almost every library is very well - organized into categories. If children are separated and kept away from adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very much out of reach for children. Society generally knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came across. However, as a parent, it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did. There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see than taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening to or watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come across. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life. I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult content because it is one - hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get a hold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in front of. However, that is life, and there will always be something that comes up in your life that you should not witness or be a part of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no need for strict censorship in libraries. It's about maintaining a balance between access to diverse materials and protecting the well - being of children.
1314	4291	2	3	Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2? I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are primarily a place for learning and focused work. For instance, if you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut, you could definitely feel awkward. Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 strongly disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decides to wander through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. This is not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not stocked that magazine, such an uncomfortable situation would never have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously. If people really want to find something that is inappropriate, they can easily find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it extremely easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore, it should be perfectly fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries. How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes? If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves, then it @MONTH1 can make things more difficult. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such. We need to ensure that libraries maintain an environment conducive to learning and positive experiences for all visitors.
1315	4292	2	3	There should be a certain age - restricted bookshelf that only certain aged people are allowed to look at. It's similar to the adult section at the library. There's no valid reason why these age - appropriate materials should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if little kids could easily access the books and movies and be offended or scared by them, but that's precisely why you would create a specific section just for older, more mature people. It would simply depend on what offends people and what would make them feel offended. Some things could or would be bad for little kids to see, but the key is to make sure they can't get in the reach of young kids or less - mature people. The only way I would say to remove these materials is if they are really offensive, such as containing racism and other extremely unacceptable content. Censorship in libraries, in my opinion, is a good thing. This is just because some people might not like the things that are in a library or the kind of content it offers. So, I would have to say yes to censorship in the library. By implementing appropriate censorship and age - restricted sections, we can create a library environment that is suitable for all age groups and protects the sensibilities of younger patrons.
1316	4293	2	3	There are numerous books, movies, and magazines neatly arranged on the shelves, which can potentially offend people in various ways. These might include books about war, depicting the gruesome realities and atrocities; books on slavery, highlighting the inhumane treatment; and even religious books that could trigger different sensitivities. Such materials can aggravate people, making them feel compelled to remove those books from the libraries without a second thought.  There are indeed many books out there that could be offensive and discriminatory, but should those books really be taken out? I firmly believe that books were made for a purpose. Each book and even magazine contains a wealth of information, whether it's about what's currently happening in the world or what could potentially occur. Even the books that are completely unrealistic are crafted with a reason in mind and should have their rightful place in the library.  The library boasts over thousands of books and movies for patrons to choose from. If there happens to be one book that someone finds discriminatory or offensive, they can simply pass by it and select one that aligns with their preferences. I feel that it is ultimately the person's choice of what they want to read or watch, and not the fault of the books or movies.  The books and movies are also neatly categorized into different genres. So, if you don't specifically want to encounter something, you can just skip the section where the movies or books you find discriminatory are located and head to the ones that make you feel comfortable.  There are also numerous books and movies out there that might initially seem discriminatory but can actually teach you valuable life lessons. For instance, when I was a child, I was reading about a girl who got into a car accident and lost everything because she was drunk while driving. My mother didn't want me reading the book, but it actually helped me a great deal. It taught me the invaluable lesson of never drinking and driving. Thanks to reading that book at such a young age and having the story imprinted in my mind, I know that I will never in my life repeat what that girl did to herself.  This clearly shows that even if a book might seem discriminatory and wrong on the surface, it can still impart important life lessons and highlight potential dangers that people probably wouldn't be aware of unless they read that book or watched that movie.  I feel that even if we were to remove the offensive magazines, books, and movies that seem to have no redeeming value, people would still find a way to access what they're looking for, whether it's from the library or other sources. There are many misguided people in this world, and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn't stop them from engaging in what they want to do.  Music is another aspect that shouldn't cause excessive concern. Some people listen to certain types of music to soothe their nerves. Take, for example, the @CAPS1 rapper @ORGANIZATION1. His songs are filled with profound sadness and frequent cussing, but they also contain messages that can resonate with other people. Listening to his songs might prevent them from engaging in illegal activities or even committing suicide. The songs can mirror their lives and make them realize that they're not the only ones going through difficult times and that they're not alone in their struggles.  I feel that each book, movie, and magazine is likely to have at least one element that someone might find offensive. If we start removing every item that someone deems offensive, there probably wouldn't be a single book left on the library shelves.  The books we read, the magazines we glance through, and the movies we watch will likely have something offensive in them, but I do not think that they should be censored or removed because there's always a possibility that those books, movies, or magazines could benefit us later in life.
1317	4294	2	3	Freedom of speech and the freedom of the press are precious privileges that we as @CAPS1 are fortunate to possess. I firmly do not believe in censorship in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have an inherent right to express their opinions in their creative work. If they wish to incorporate some adult - themed subjects in their work, that is entirely their choice. They have the right as individuals to portray their books, magazines, and movies in any way they see fit.  We all have the autonomy to decide which books and movies we want to borrow from libraries. Movies are required to carry ratings so that the audience can gauge the level of maturity needed to watch the film. For example, if you are a @NUM1 - year - old who wants to borrow a movie, but it's rated @CAPS2, it's not the most suitable choice. It likely won't be the best option because movies rated @CAPS2 clearly indicate that they are intended for a mature audience over the age of @NUM2.  As for books, I frequently rely on a book review website that enables me to understand the content of the book. If I notice that the book contains material I'd rather not read about or consider it too mature for my taste, I simply avoid it. I hold the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to select those that are best suited to my age and maturity level.  There are multiple ways we can assess the content of the items we can borrow from the library. Just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. We make choices in our daily lives, some significant and some minor. Picking a book or film from a library is a relatively small decision, but it's our prerogative to choose what we can handle.  Authors, directors, and editors should not have their work penalized just because some people disagree with the content they include in their material. Everyone's opinion on what's right and wrong varies. Therefore, if you believe something is inappropriate, you have the option of not reading or watching it.  I truly believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. Although we shouldn't abuse it, we must also remember that we have no right to dictate how others use this freedom. Just as we have the choice to read what we want, authors have the choice of what they want to write about. Libraries shouldn't deprive us of this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions about what we view or read.
1318	4295	2	3	Do you ever have the feeling that books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media can be offensive at times? From my personal experience of listening to music and watching movies, they can be offensive without us even realizing it. I've listened to rap music before, and the excessive use of cuss words can be off - putting. And when watching movies that only feature white people or black people, it can also give an unbalanced and potentially offensive impression. So, I think some music, movies, and other media might need to be re - evaluated.  However, if I think something is offensive, I usually just brush it off. I do this because I've watched @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, where the white and black people initially didn't get along. They had to play football together, and eventually, they overcame their differences, got along, and won the championship game. To me, that's truly awesome because people who were initially offended managed to put aside their differences and become friends. So, I don't take @CAPS3 as offensive. I say this because how can you be sure that the actor or the writer was actually referring to you? I view this as a minor issue. I enjoy @CAPS3 of this nature as I find it entertaining. It can also be educational, helping us learn about what's happening in our world and what we've accomplished. So, I really don't take @CAPS3 as offensive. But other people may take it offensively, and that's their personal choice. There's nothing that can be done about it once it's out there. If something is offensive, then simply don't listen to it, watch it, or read it. So, it's not right to pull it off the shelf and condemn it. There could be a really profound meaning behind it. There are countless movies, songs, and books in the world that are of high quality. So, don't abhor it; just move on with your life and don't let @CAPS3 get to you.  That's why I don't think it's right to pull offensive media off the shelf and take it too seriously. And that's why I believe it's not necessarily a bad thing to not be overly offended by @CAPS3.
1319	4296	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I would like to begin by stating that yes, books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are indeed wonderful resources for the kids in the library. I think it's an excellent activity for them when they have free time; they can go to the library to read or work on various tasks. I also believe that some educational materials should be available in the library as we are in high school, and we need to learn certain things. However, some of the content we encounter is not very appropriate.  In high school, just walking down the hallways, you're bound to learn a lot of things that you probably don't need to know at this stage. And when you enter a library, it shouldn't encourage such inappropriate learning by stocking books about drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves.  Books about drugs can be acceptable to a certain extent. Reading about medications you can take, being in a doctor's office, and getting prescriptions is fine. But when there are books about pot, weed, crank, or meth, that's going too far. We need to learn about these drugs and the harm they can cause if we use or abuse them, but we don't need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth.  Books about alcohol follow the same principle. We need to be aware of the dangers of drinking, but we don't need to read about teen parties and activities associated with being drunk.  Advertisements, magazines, etc., are the worst influences on us kids. Almost all of them are related to drugs, alcohol, or sex and seem to be enticing us to engage in these things in high school. The front covers of magazines always feature stories about people caught with drugs, who's dating or having affairs with whom. I know that we will and should learn about these things eventually, but I don't think we should read about them in books because then we read about how others did it, and we might feel tempted to try it ourselves.  I firmly believe that these books that cross the line regarding alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be removed from the libraries so that the kids have appropriate materials to learn from and can discuss relevant topics with their parents. I've been in libraries, and I know for a fact that the first books I'm drawn to often involve one of these three themes because they seem interesting, and we like reading about party stories, someone getting pregnant, or an @ORGANIZATION1. But when I read them, I also start thinking about it, and I might start to think that going to a party sounds fun.  This is my opinion about some of those books on the shelves and what I think should be done. Sincerely, @LOCATION1.
1320	4297	2	3	Libraries Do you visit libraries? Many people all around the world go to libraries for a multitude of reasons. Sometimes, when you go there, you need to have a clear purpose. You also have to maintain a very quiet environment. Libraries are fascinating in numerous ways.  Some @MONTH1 might wonder what a library is. Well, they are great places to visit. People can go there for various activities. Most of the time, when people visit a library, they go to borrow books. But it's not just about getting books; you can also go there for school tutoring, to have a quiet place to read, or simply to have a peaceful retreat. You see, libraries offer a wide range of things to do.  Why do people go to libraries? Well, personally, I don't visit a library very often, but many others do. People who love reading go there to find the specific kind of book they want. I would go there for school tutoring because I really need it. It's extremely helpful and can get your homework done efficiently. My mother visits the library on some occasions, such as to gather information from a book or use a computer. The library has a vast amount of information that you can explore. Then there are the tech - savvy individuals, like the online geeks, who like to use the internet for video games. I use the internet at the library, but not for gaming. There's yet another reason why people go to the library.  My little sister adores going to the library. She's only eight years old. Why am I sharing this? Well, when you enter a library, if you're under a certain age, you can't borrow a book without your parents' permission. Not only that, you also need to have a library card to borrow a book. I know, these rules might seem a bit strict, right? And you also need your parents' permission to get the library card! After all the permission - getting process is over, when you go to pick a book, you have to make sure it's at your own grade level. I have to keep an eye on this with my sister all the time because if not, the library staff will scold you. I personally think these rules are beneficial for most kids. So, now you know that libraries have strict regulations.  Now that I've told you all about libraries, I hope you've learned something. Remember that they are excellent places to go for information, to borrow books, or just to have a quiet time. You can easily find a library nearby as there are plenty of them! Well, if you don't like reading or being quiet, then a library might not be the right place for you. I'll leave that decision up to you.
1321	4298	2	3	In @LOCATION1, people enjoy engaging in a wide variety of activities for entertainment. Some individuals prefer the immersive experience of going to the movies, while others find solace in a leisurely stroll through the park. Nowadays, there is a growing sentiment that we should shield ourselves from content that is considered bad, nasty, or offensive. However, I firmly believe that we should have the freedom to access whatever we desire.  The first reason we should be able to read whatever we want is that it is our fundamental right. There are numerous restrictions in our lives, but reading should not be one of them. We shouldn't have to seek permission to determine if a book is suitable for us. It is unjust to those who have a genuine interest in reading it. I find this kind of censorship extremely foolish.  The second reason is straightforward: if you don't like something, simply don't read it. This is a simple and logical concept. In today's society, people are overly concerned about what others are doing. If you come across a book that you find offensive, the most sensible thing to do is to put it down and move on. For instance, if I knew a book was offensive to me, I would never pick it up and read it. It's as easy as that.  The third and final reason is that what others read is none of our business. Everyone seems to be overly preoccupied with the actions of others, which is quite absurd. If we focused on our own lives and reading choices, we would be in a better position. If I read a book that I found offensive, I wouldn't go around trying to get it removed from the shelves. It is neither right nor fair to impose our opinions on others.  In conclusion, we should have the freedom to read whatever we want. It is our right, and if we don't like something, we can choose to avoid it. People today need to stop being so overly concerned about what others are reading. If someone wants to read a book that you find offensive, there is nothing you can do about it. That is the reality of life, and we should respect each other's choices.
1322	4299	2	3	If you are easily offended by certain content, it is advisable not to read the pieces of literature that trigger such feelings. Before delving into a book or magazine, you can consult some of your friends or conduct a quick online search to gather more information. Sometimes, the cover of a publication can be misleading, so it is crucial to read the description carefully.  Many people tend to misinterpret certain literary works @MONTH1 and assume that they convey a message that is not actually intended. This is often the reason why they take offense. However, the more you engage with and understand a piece of literature, the less likely you are to be offended. You should at least attempt to accept some of the ideas presented in the book or magazine, as they might prove useful in the future.  It is common to feel upset when you read something for the first time @MONTH1. You might not immediately recognize that it could offer valuable insights or solutions. Taking the time to think about what you've read is an excellent way to learn how to handle being offended. Try to view the situation from both perspectives, as both could have valid points and practical applications.  If you still find yourself offended by certain content, it is best to avoid it. Limit your exposure to books and magazines that contain offensive material. Also, ignore the advertisements on television or the internet that provide more information than you need or make you feel uncomfortable. Reading or watching such content can exacerbate your negative emotions or even make you angry. In some cases, it can also cause a certain level of stress.  In conclusion, if you are truly offended by something, the most effective approach is to avoid it. By doing so, you can prevent yourself from reading or thinking about it. This strategy is applicable not only in this context but also in many other situations. If you need to escape from stress, simply ignore the source of your discomfort.
1323	4300	2	3	Books possess a remarkable ability to transport us to entirely new worlds and introduce us to novel ideas that we @MONTH1 may have never considered before. However, the question arises: are there some books that are simply too extreme and should not be read? Well, you can form your own opinion, but I firmly believe that all reading materials and media should remain available on the shelves in libraries. People have the right to be aware of the realities of the world, including the less pleasant aspects.  Different types of media should definitely not be removed from libraries or banned. People need to be educated about all aspects of existence, including the negative elements. By being informed about the bad things in the world, they can hopefully gain the knowledge and awareness necessary to steer clear of evil acts and actively contribute to the fight against them. Moreover, it is their fundamental right to choose what they want to read, as each individual should have the freedom to shape their own identity. We can only hope that by providing people with such knowledge, they will rise up and do what is right.  Even in the field of education @DATE1, there are individuals who advocate for restricting the knowledge that students can access. However, in the long run, does this truly benefit people? If people were given the opportunity to learn about everything and make their own choices regarding what to study, wouldn't it prevent them from becoming overly curious and seeking information from unreliable sources? Instead, they would have access to a wide range of resources in the library. Each individual should have the right to pursue knowledge as they see fit, without being limited by censorship. Otherwise, they @MONTH1 may never uncover the real truth behind a topic, which would defeat the purpose of learning. These seekers of knowledge should always be able to explore freely, so that they @MONTH1 can acquire new knowledge and potentially make significant contributions for the benefit of everyone. However, this can only be achieved through proper education.  Another important point to consider is that people need a diverse range of education to support causes that are important to them. With knowledge, they can make innovative breakthroughs, generate new ideas, and spread them to make the world a better place. However, this can only happen when they have a comprehensive understanding of both sides of an issue. If they oppose something, they need to be well-informed about what they are against and what cause they are advocating for. The only way for people to effectively communicate their ideas is when they have a deep understanding of the topics at hand. Without access to certain pieces of information that might be censored, people @MONTH1 may lack the credibility and substance to support their arguments, and they may even impede the learning process of others.  Furthermore, in @LOCATION1, and hopefully globally in the future, we all have the right to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness, as long as we do not interfere with the dreams of others. People need to be true to themselves in order to make a positive impact on the world. If we were not allowed to express our individuality, there would be no progress. Without the pursuit of knowledge, people would have remained stagnant in their cultures and beliefs. Instead, they chose to explore and learn, which has led to the technological advancements we enjoy @DATE1. Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular book series that we must understand our enemies in order to defeat them. His popularity suggests that many people share this belief. To impose censorship would go against the rights that people have fought for, and it would result in a regression of society.  In conclusion, people should always have unrestricted access to all types of media, especially in libraries. These media sources play a crucial role in shaping our identities and enabling us to make meaningful contributions to the world. Although there will always be some media that contains offensive or inappropriate content, we must understand that it is a part of the world we live in. By being exposed to different perspectives, we can make informed decisions and choose to combat the negative aspects. We would not be the people we are @DATE1 without the influence of various forms of media, and removing any part of our knowledge would only hinder our personal and collective growth. These choices are essential for our continued advancement and the pursuit of a better future.
1324	4301	2	3	I firmly believe that if some individuals find a particular book or movie offensive, they should have the right to inform the library, and the library should take appropriate action to remove the item from its shelves. Libraries should prioritize the comfort and safety of their customers by removing content that is offensive to them.  Many parents who visit libraries with their children allow them to explore the books independently, just as my @CAPS1 used to do when I was a child. However, this can pose a risk if children wander into the adult reading section without adult supervision. They may come across inappropriate content or purchase a magazine that appears innocent on the outside but contains offensive images inside.  When I was ten years old, my family and I went on a vacation to @LOCATION1. One night, while watching a baseball game during a commercial break, we were flipping through the channels waiting for the game to resume. Suddenly, an offensive image appeared on the television screen, an image that children's eyes should never be exposed to. Neither I nor my parents expected to see such content, and it was clearly intended for adult audiences only. This incident serves as a reminder that libraries should be more vigilant when curating their collections. Similar situations can occur in libraries, as young children may not always be able to distinguish between children's books and adult magazines. They may also ask their parents for music that has a seemingly innocent cover but contains explicit lyrics or other inappropriate content. This is precisely why all offensive items in libraries should be removed. If library patrons find something on the shelves that they find offensive, they should be able to request that the library take it off. While the library may not always comply immediately, removing such items would make libraries a more enjoyable and safe environment for children. Failing to do so could have a negative impact on the library's business. However, the library should only consider the requests of regular visitors. It should not give too much weight to the opinions of those who have visited the library only a few times. Instead, it should prioritize the concerns of its loyal customers.  In conclusion, all offensive images and content that are likely to offend library visitors should be removed from the shelves. Libraries should listen to their customers not only because it can affect their business but also because it can have a significant impact on the lives of children. By creating a safe and comfortable environment, libraries can better serve their communities and fulfill their role as a source of knowledge and entertainment.
1325	4302	2	3	The issue of offensive content in libraries is a matter of concern. Nowadays, many libraries house a variety of books that contain violent and inappropriate content. The question is whether these books, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves. Let's explore the different perspectives.  Libraries should not be required to remove such items. Instead, they can create separate sections for books with offensive content. For movies rated @CAPS1, they can be included in the library, but access should be restricted to individuals over @NUM1 years of age. Similarly, for music with an @CAPS2 sticker, only those over @NUM2 should be allowed to rent it. If parents are opposed to their children accessing such content, they have the option to refrain from renting it.  Libraries should establish distinct sections for offensive books. Children below a certain age should be prohibited from accessing these books. If a child still wishes to read a book from this section, they must obtain parental permission.  Rated @CAPS1 movies can be part of the library's collection. However, individuals must be over @NUM1 to enter the area where these movies are stored, and they must be accompanied by an adult. To rent a movie, parental permission is required, and the movie must be watched in the presence of an adult.  For music with an @CAPS2 sticker, individuals must be over @NUM2 to rent it. If a child's parents give their consent, the child can still rent the music. The library should place the @CAPS5 behind the counter to prevent young children from seeing the covers. If parents disagree with the library's rules, they can choose not to rent anything from the library.  In conclusion, rather than removing offensive books, movies, and @CAPS5, libraries should implement appropriate measures to manage access. By creating separate sections and setting age restrictions, libraries can ensure that patrons have access to a diverse range of materials while also protecting the well - being of younger visitors. If you were in charge of a library, you would need to balance the need for freedom of access with the responsibility of providing a safe environment. You would have to decide whether to remove offensive items or simply organize them in a way that respects the rights and sensitivities of all patrons.
1326	4303	2	3	Reading is a widely - loved activity. It offers a great pastime whether you're relaxing at home or sitting in the classroom. School libraries are stocked with a rich variety of books, magazines, and other reading materials. Among these, some books may be considered offensive by certain individuals. However, these books should remain on the library shelves.   There are indeed books that can be so off - putting to some readers that they can't bring themselves to finish them. Whether the offensive content is sexual or political, readers who find it distasteful will simply stop reading. For instance, there are books with detailed sexual descriptions, and many parents are reluctant to have their kids read such materials. But this isn't a valid reason to remove these books from the library. Just because it's offensive to some, it doesn't mean others who can handle such content won't want to read it. Parents should guide their kids to avoid these books instead of having the library take them away.  Politics - related books also pose a similar issue. Most people hold firm political beliefs and are not open - minded when discussing what they think is right. When a reader stumbles upon a book that contradicts their political views, it can lead to a problem. Politicians, in particular, may overreact. Nevertheless, many authors write about politics to educate readers on different perspectives. If a reader disagrees with the author or finds the content offensive, they should put the book down. There are other readers eager to learn more about politics from these books. Readers who know they'll be offended should avoid picking up such books in the first place.  Libraries often offer music, movies, and magazines for borrowing. Some movies or song lyrics can be offensive to certain people. In such cases, those individuals should refrain from checking them out. Many people enjoy music or movies with offensive language as it can add flavor. People should know their limits and stay away if they're aware of the offensive content. As long as there are readers and viewers who like these materials, they should stay on the shelves. Removing them would reduce the number of library visitors. You might see people at the local library spending time in the music section, and that section could be their main reason for coming. So, the music and movie sections should stay in libraries. Patrons should be mature enough to decide if they can tolerate the content.  In conclusion, libraries should not remove books, movies, and magazines that some people find offensive. Just because something is offensive to one person doesn't mean it will be to another. Libraries need to maintain a diverse collection for all types of readers. Reading is a very popular activity, and readers expect a wide selection of books, music, and movies to choose from.
1327	4304	2	3	In every school or library, it's common for people to come across books that don't suit their taste. Everyone has their own unique opinion. What might seem offensive to you could be something someone else wants to learn about. So, the question arises: should we remove the books that the majority think are offensive from the shelves, or should we keep them? Here's my stance on this matter.  Books are primarily for learning and enjoyment, not to intentionally offend anyone. Each book has its own purpose and was written for a reason. There are numerous books that many people dislike, but that doesn't mean there isn't someone who appreciates them. We should keep the books in schools and libraries because they might offer help to someone in a certain way. If these books weren't available, how could that person get the assistance they need when there are no other alternatives?  One practical solution is to categorize the books by genre. This way, people will know exactly what they're looking for. Many people encounter 'offensive' books by chance. If books are properly categorized, such accidental encounters can be avoided. It also helps keep the library well - organized. When you enter the library, you can go straight to the section you need and avoid looking at anything that might be offensive to you.  Keeping books on the shelves is the core mission of all libraries and schools. That's what libraries are mainly for. They help you acquire knowledge and information that you might not find elsewhere. If libraries removed every book that someone complained about, there would be little left in the library.  In summary, everyone has the right to their opinion and can think a book is offensive. But the reality is that books are written for a purpose. If the library or the publisher thought the book would cause a major problem, they probably wouldn't have made it available. So, we should keep the books on the shelves to ensure a rich and diverse reading environment.
1328	4305	2	3	Going to the library can be a bit of a challenge when faced with a vast array of book genres. And it's not just about books; there's also music and magazines to consider. Among the books, there are various subjects and categories, including kids' books, biographies, and autobiographies. Additionally, there's a wide range of music styles to cater to different tastes. Some people might claim that certain books and music are offensive or inappropriate. However, I believe there's no need to worry about staying away from the materials you find offensive. Therefore, I don't think certain books or music should be removed from the shelves due to a few individual opinions.  There are countless different books in a library. Just because one person finds a particular book offensive doesn't mean it should be taken off the shelves. The reason is that someone else might find it a valuable resource and may need it for a project or personal interest. People should know what they're looking for at the library. If they think a book might be offensive, they can simply avoid checking it out.  This issue is similar to situations in other places around the world. For example, when you go to the mall, you know which shops you like and visit them, while staying away from the ones that sell items you find offensive. But that doesn't mean those shops should be banned from the mall because some people might find them interesting and want to buy their products. The same logic applies to books and materials in the library.  A library can address this problem without removing the books by conducting a survey among local visitors. By asking them about their opinions on different book genres and music styles, the library can then separate these items into different categories or sections. This would significantly help solve the problem as people can easily avoid the sections they find offensive and locate what they're looking for more efficiently.  I personally have diverse reading and music preferences. When I read, I'm not always drawn to the most popular subjects. I enjoy reading about murder files, drug busts, biographies, and autobiographies. In terms of music, I listen to a wide variety, including hip - hop, country, alternative, and rock. Some people might find my choices strange, but it just shows that not everyone has the same reading and listening preferences.  In conclusion, the library should maintain a wide selection of different materials to keep all its patrons happy. By respecting individual choices and not removing materials based on a few negative opinions, the library can continue to serve as a place of diverse knowledge and entertainment.
1329	4306	2	3	I firmly believe that libraries should not remove any of the books they currently have. If parents or individuals don't want to read certain types of books, they simply don't have to. But these books shouldn't be taken off the shelves. It's true that some books contain inappropriate language, but that's part of how the story is crafted. Once a book is written and published, it shouldn't be altered.  If a person believes a particular scene in a book is inappropriate, they should put the book back and choose another one that they find suitable. Some readers, like me, enjoy books with detailed descriptions so that they can vividly picture the scenes in their minds. Libraries do have books with inappropriate language and scenes, but they usually set an age limit. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, which is a good measure. By that age, kids have a better understanding of things, and parents shouldn't be overly concerned. So, in my opinion, these books should stay in libraries.  On the other hand, movies with disturbing scenarios should be removed. Movies are different from books. They visually present the described content, and I don't think teens should be exposed to such material. It can be extremely inappropriate and disturbing, especially when watched in front of parents or younger siblings. Of course, this is just my view. If parents are okay with their children watching such movies, then it might not be an issue.  Music isn't as big of a problem, but there are parents who don't want their children listening to certain types of music due to their religious beliefs. I completely understand this. My parents initially didn't let me listen to music that constantly sang about sex and used curse words. As I got older, they became less strict because I listened to such music less frequently. As a teen, I also believe that some of today's music isn't appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of the lyrics don't even make sense. In libraries, I think they should only have music that is somehow related to the books.  Magazines generally aren't a major concern. Most magazines focus on beauty, fashion tips, horoscopes, and offer advice. They also keep people updated on celebrities' lifestyles and have a bit of gossip. They're mostly aimed at older teens and adults. For younger teens and kids, there are more appropriate magazines that talk about younger celebrities.  In conclusion, while everyone is entitled to their opinion on what is appropriate or not, libraries should maintain a balance. Books should stay, movies with disturbing content should be carefully considered, music selection should be relevant to the library's collection, and magazines should be suitable for different age groups. This way, libraries can continue to serve as a valuable resource for all.
1330	4307	2	3	Do you think that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if some people find them offensive? I firmly believe we shouldn't take this approach. If we were to remove books from the shelves every time someone thought they were offensive, there would be hardly any books left.  Based on my prior knowledge, I understand that different materials affect people differently. I've had a personal experience in school where some students refused to say the pledge because of the phrase 'one nation, under God.' We all have diverse opinions on various subjects, so our reactions will vary. However, this doesn't mean we should take away something just because some people find it offensive, as others may find it perfectly appropriate.  Observing how people react in offensive situations can help us find a solution. Removing the offensive materials is definitely not the answer, as many people will oppose it. Censorship in libraries should be based on separation. Materials of the same category should be placed in one section. This separation often helps people find what they need without being offended. For example, a person looking for children's books can go directly to that section and avoid the sections with potentially offensive content.  Our constitution guarantees that all citizens are free, especially in terms of freedom of speech. All materials are written by individuals expressing their opinions. By removing their books from the shelves, we are taking away their right to freedom of speech. It's their way of self - expression. If someone finds the content offensive, they should simply choose not to read it. Removing the material may frustrate and offend the author and other readers who appreciate it.  In conclusion, we should not remove certain materials just because someone finds them offensive. Censorship in libraries should focus on separation rather than catering to those who are easily offended. It's about giving people the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch. So, what's your stance on this? Should certain materials be removed from the library shelves?
1331	4308	2	3	Have you ever wandered through the library just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even CD that doesn't involve inappropriate material for once? You feel like a little kid in the shopping mall, impatiently waiting to find that one special toy, but it never shows up. You spend seconds, then minutes, and even hours, still slowly pacing back and forth from shelf to shelf. Finally, you find it, open it, and see the most inappropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgar language, or even skim through the most offensive reading yet. Do you wish it'd change? I visit the library every time after I finish a book. I've loved reading since I was little. Lately, I feel like my reading interest has gone down, not because I'm involved in other things, but possibly because lately, every book I pick up seems offensive. For example, I went to check out a new book. I was completely puzzled at that time because, unlike usual, I had no idea which book I was interested in reading next. The librarian directed me to their new best - seller and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it out, and after the first paragraph, I wanted to throw up. This book was too gory and I felt like it downgraded women. I was anything but satisfied. This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope I could check out a book that isn't so offensive and is actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me. Our library seems to be over - packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as a light read and they're very good at passing free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. Lately, my opinion has changed though. These magazines are starting to alter and I don't like it. It seems as if I can't open a page without seeing a half - dressed girl, some inappropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection. Seeing these vulgar images is enough to make me not only flip the page but also never second - guess about opening a magazine again. Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted. There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same. I go to the library to check out some new CDs, and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actually sell this garbage. I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new inappropriate vocabulary. I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. We just need to find it again. I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnecessary items at the library. I know I'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard many others would too. We want reading materials worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we want music that won't pollute our brains. In conclusion, it's high time we made the library a place that offers clean and enjoyable content for all.
1332	4309	2	3	I don't think certain materials should be removed from library shelves. People have the option to get what they choose from the shelves. The librarians don't force them to choose the item. It is a free country, and I think people should choose what they want. If the people don't like it, then they can read the back of the movie or book before they choose it. Everyone has different tastes, and just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean it should be taken away from others who might enjoy it. Libraries are meant to be a place that caters to a wide range of interests. By removing materials, we limit the choices available to the public. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of choice and keep all materials on the shelves for those who want them.
1333	4310	2	3	I believe that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the United States, there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the United States of @LOCATION1 for their music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free? I think that there should be no way that anything can be banned in a library; there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad? I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents don't want their children seeing. So don't censor it. Still have it, just make it so that you have to be a certain age to see that movie from a library. There should be no censorship in the land of free speech. How would we be called the land of the free if we are censoring everything? That is why I don't think we should censor anything in @LOCATION1. Censorship goes against the very principles of freedom that this country was built on. We should allow people to make their own choices and expose themselves to different forms of art and expression. In conclusion, maintaining a censorship - free environment in @LOCATION1 is essential for upholding the values of freedom and free speech.
1334	4311	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves if someone thinks they are offensive. Just because one person finds them offensive doesn't mean that they should be taken away from others who @MONTH1 like them. People are different, and therefore we like different types of things, like different music, books, movies, and magazines. If you find it offensive, don't listen, look, or read it. Listen to the music you like, watch the movies you like, and read the books and magazines you enjoy. But just because you don't like something, don't try and take it away from those that do. People are very different in many ways. We all have our own unique personalities and preferences. Let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes. Censorship has always been an issue, but I believe that if people would just stick to what they know and like and leave everything and everyone else alone, all would be ok. I understand that some people might find some things that are on the shelves today offensive. But if you don't like it, don't look at it or listen to it. Let it go and stick to what you know and like. After all, the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of preferences and avoid imposing our own views through censorship.
1335	4312	2	3	Do you believe that if you just take a book off a shelf you or your kids won't be exposed to offensive material? If you do, then you are wrong. You can't isolate your family or other families from the world because you are scared that they might pick up something bad. Everyday, whether they read a book or not, they are still exposed to vulgar behavior. All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us. The quote by Katherine Paterson also helps understand the concept. If someone were to take a book off of a shelf at their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no books left for children and even adults to read. In every book, there is some form of material that people @MONTH1 not be a fan of. There would soon be nothing left. There isn't a day that goes by that a kid doesn't hear something offensive. Even at school, where it's supervised, children bring words that they have heard their parents say or things that they have seen their parents do, and they share them with other kids. You can't protect them from every small encounter they are faced with. Some books are by far more offensive than others, but are you going to give a kid a book that has vulgar language or, will you give a child a book that's about @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 running out of honey in his jar? Most children don't go to a library or a store without supervision if their parent is @CAPS1 careful about just books. Therefore, their parents probably aren't going to allow them to pick up an obscene book or magazine, and in fact, they would probably try to hide it from them. If a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material. If you can't make the world kid - safe, then why would you try to make a library the same exact way. There are other people out there that might find the very material that you find offensive fascinating, and a library is there to suit everyone's needs. It isn't there for just children. In conclusion, we should recognize the diversity of interests and the impracticality of complete censorship, and let libraries serve as a place for all types of readers.
1336	4313	2	3	I think that we should remove certain things like movies, music, and books. There should definitely be a debate about this because these days people are doing things they've never done before. For example, music is a powerful influence. It can motivate people to do things and get deeply involved in the songs. People often try to imitate what their favorite artists or actors do. I've heard some songs that talk about illegal things. When I look around, I hear children talking about those things and asking their parents what they are. But parents sometimes don't want to tell them the truth. Once these kids get older, they'll know what it is and it will be their choice whether to follow that path or think about something else. The singers present these ideas in a way that seems harmless, saying you can do these things all the time and enjoy them without getting in trouble. In reality, kids are naive and don't know what they're getting themselves into.  Also, many books contain offensive language that kids read regularly, and people often don't even notice. This is how kids can get in trouble at school. They might learn a new word in a book they're too young to understand, but they do it out of curiosity. That's one way a child can develop bad habits as they grow older because they've learned things they shouldn't have. I think that as a responsible society, we should create sections in libraries and stores to indicate what people can and can't read, based on their age.  Some school libraries have movies available for students, depending on whether they're in elementary school, middle school, etc. However, some of these movies have offensive language and inappropriate scenes. Kids might want to imitate what they see and learn to do those types of things. They might think it's cool when they see actors in movies cursing. I think elementary students should only watch PG movies, middle - school students should watch PG - 13 and below, and high - school students should be able to see most movies. But at the same time, high - school students need to be more mature. Maybe that's why they don't always have the privilege to watch any movie, as some people don't know how to handle themselves.  Finally, I really think we should regulate some movies, music, and books because kids are learning things they shouldn't until they're older. These three forms of media can change the world in many different ways, some good but most bad. These are my opinions.
1337	4314	2	3	There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that is used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes, items like movies, books, and magazines on the shelves can be seriously offensive to people of different races or religions. These materials may contain derogatory remarks, inaccurate stereotypes, or content that goes against the beliefs of certain groups.  Censorship can be used to solve this problem. For example, in the book Fahrenheit 451, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely to prevent the society from becoming offended or even thinking. However, in the current situation, there is an overabundance of all kinds of negative material, and people seem not to care about what it can do to others or how it can damage other people's feelings and beliefs.  This issue can also be argued from another perspective. The people who are offended by the material, whether due to religious or racial reasons, don't necessarily have to be around it. For instance, if the offensive material is in a library, they don't need to go to that library. They can choose other sources of entertainment or information.  In conclusion, people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended. But at the same time, those who produce and distribute such material should not be so cruel and should be more considerate of others' feelings.
1338	4315	2	3	Personally, in my opinion, I have no problem with anything found in libraries today. Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but if it's not hurting you, just ignore it. Kids usually don't wander around in the adult section of the library; they go to the kids' section, so there's no need to worry about them. These days, kids are maturing at a much younger age. I believe there is no harm in libraries. It is a place where you can go to get all the information you can. So why would you remove valuable information?  The library is a place for all people, regardless of who you are, how old you are, or what you look like. Everyone can use the library for various reasons, often related to school. Personally, I don't use public libraries very much, but I often come to the school library to get work done or find a specific book.  For example, you might find Hitler to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about. But for me, as a German - American, I want to learn more about my own culture, no matter how dark some parts of it may be. So why take that information away from me? Taking away a learning experience just because a group of people don't like a book doesn't mean everyone doesn't like it. I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from.  Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs. Overall, I think the library is not a place to take things away when anyone is welcome. It is a place to get away from it all, and I think they should leave them just how they are.
1339	4316	2	3	I do not think people should take books off the shelves because town libraries have a wide variety of those types of books. People should be able to enjoy reading all kinds of books. Different people have different reading preferences. Little kids typically like fantasy and picture books, teenagers are often into romance, and others prefer non - fiction. It should not matter what other people think about these choices.  If people removed books from the shelves, then what would the other people read? Before taking books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of just doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if you removed books from the shelves. You would lose customers. Libraries rely on the diverse interests of their patrons, and removing books would limit the options available and drive people away.  If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you could make a card system where parents give their permission for their children to read those books. If that doesn't work, then you can set an age limit. Have the parents show you their child's birth certificate. Also, have a restricted section in the library. In order to get a book from the restricted section, a parent should sign a note saying their child is allowed.  Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If they are fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not be a major concern for parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem with that either. The other things you can figure out on your own.  This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I've told you how a library should work and what I think should go on in the library. I'll give you some advice. Think before you act. That is all I'm going to tell you.
1340	4317	2	3	I believe that all materials should be allowed in libraries because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to, and watch. Even if people banned some books from the library, other people would find a way to get them. As the people of America, we have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely.  As for music and movies, I think we've let ourselves go a bit too far. We've made pornography easily accessible, and there's a lot of music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from complete chaos in this regard is the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and their ratings on movies, music, and television. These ratings at least give us some idea of what to expect and help parents make informed decisions.  With magazines, it's a bit more complicated. Magazines have their own set of standards. We all know about Playboy, Penthouse, and other well - known magazines, but think about all the less - known magazines that stay behind closed doors and rarely come to public attention. These might contain even more extreme or inappropriate content.  In conclusion, while I support the free access to materials in libraries, we also need to be aware of the potential negative impacts of some forms of media. We should rely on existing rating systems and parental guidance to ensure that people, especially the younger generation, are exposed to appropriate content.
1341	4318	2	3	I do not think that books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should be removed just because some people do not like them. Maybe some others do like them and enjoy reading, watching, or listening to them. There should be no reason that one person or a group of persons should try taking something off of a shelf at a library just because they find it offensive.   Many people have a wide range of preferences and like many different things. Sometimes, the materials you read or consume might affect others, but often, you are mainly focused on what you want and like and what is offensive to you. What if something you were watching, reading, or listening to was offending someone else? Would you care? Would it bother you if someone told you it was offending them? Everyone has different tastes, and some others may not always agree with what they are going to be interested in. In the end, we should respect the diversity of preferences and not let the opinions of a few limit the choices available to others.
1342	4319	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? What I am going to discuss is whether I believe certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I will also talk about my introduction, body, and conclusion.   Do I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and anything else on any bookshelves or other shelves that is offensive to anyone should be removed? I think this because nobody should have to be exposed to offensive content. Everyone should be able to live without being offended by the materials they encounter.   I just explained and talked about whether the offensive things on shelves should be removed, and I answered yes. I also talked about the introduction, the body, and the conclusion. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from shelves can create a more comfortable and inclusive environment for all.
1343	4320	2	3	It is well - known that anybody is able to rent books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries. It is also a fact that some of the material in libraries may be offensive or inappropriate. While some people believe that such items should be removed from the shelves, I believe that books, magazines, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves. People should have the freedom to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to. If someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in their house, then he or she simply doesn't have to rent it. And just because something seems offensive doesn't mean it still isn't enjoyable.  The most important reason why I believe that items that appear to be offensive should not be removed from library shelves is that people should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they desire. Every individual is entitled to his or her own preference. Some people prefer R - rated movies or music with explicit content. If that's what people are interested in, then so be it. Anybody should not have to stop renting something that they want just because someone else doesn't approve.  Furthermore, if someone doesn't want something offensive in his or her house, then they can simply choose not to get it. No one is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something that they don't want. It's a straightforward choice. People don't have the right to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want. If someone doesn't prefer something, then they don't have to rent it.  Finally, just because something seems offensive doesn't mean it lacks value or isn't enjoyable. The best example that I can think of is a movie that is R - rated. Just because a movie is rated R doesn't mean it doesn't have a good story or a moral message. There are plenty of R - rated movies that have won numerous awards and other rewards. Another example is the singer Eminem. While his music may be offensive to some, there are still many people who enjoy it. Certain things that offend people can be enjoyable for others.  In conclusion, no one has the right to stop anyone from renting what they want from a library. People should mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if certain people believe they are. People can only make choices for themselves, and that's all there is to it.
1344	4321	2	3	Do you believe that books or any different materials should be removed from the library's shelf? No, because those books or materials are not suitable for everybody to look at. For instance, if you have kids, you should keep them in a kids' area. We cannot just start taking down every book off the shelf because it was considered a 'bad' book.  The reason why kids should stay in the kids' area is so that they won't pick up a book that's not appropriate for them. We want kids to be reading children's books. If a kid picks up a bad book, you should explain to them that this book is not for them. Some books are inappropriate for kids to read, so that's why they have their own area. Kids should not leave their area in search of an inappropriate book.   I think that kids should listen to appropriate music in a library. The inappropriate books or materials are not for the kids to read, so they should not be in that area to pick up a bad book. I feel like there are no truly 'bad' books out there. If you don't like a book, maybe someone else will. And movies, music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf because if it was inappropriate, it probably wouldn't be in the library in the first place. Everybody is not going to like everything, but that's just life. We should respect the diversity of materials in the library to meet different needs.
1345	4322	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with an astonishingly huge diversity. Fiction, non - fiction, horror, fashion, science - fiction, and many more categories of literature are crafted. There is truly something out there that everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had a negative opinion of it?   Everyone has an opinion. It may be in favor of something or it may not be. I firmly believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people it may be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it. Someone may enjoy a piece of work that another finds offensive. It is all a matter of opinion. The opinion of one person should not affect whether materials can be on a shelf or not.  If you walked into a library and the shelves were filled with books, but only books that everyone had a good opinion about, the shelves wouldn't seem very full. It is extremely hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public library. Censorship is understandable to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections. In these categories and sections, people can look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not.  Libraries have rated R movies. Many people could consider rated R movies to be offensive, but many people could also enjoy watching rated R movies. Who wins, the people who find them offensive or the people who enjoy them? It is a hard choice to make. I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them. The same goes for books, magazines, and music. If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it.  There are hundreds of different styles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines. They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. They cannot censor things just because some people find them offensive. Others may enjoy them. What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public library? In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of cultural products and respect the different opinions of individuals.
1346	4323	2	3	Should there be censorship in the Libraries or not? Many people have their own personal views on this subject. Everyone should clearly know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and other materials that they themselves have purchased. Now they want them censored? I don't think that is very right. Libraries should take all the censored material and create a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section. It would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that might apply to that section. The library was built for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and quietly read. Not everyone goes to the library for a book; some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine. Well, whatever it is, the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just to get. How do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library? The internet and other media are way more offensive than material in a library, so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library? If libraries have to do that, then so should all the other entertainment industries. Finally, every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility. My opinion says we should just move the material elsewhere in the building, in its own little wing or something. Where people could, if they would like to, go in and check something out, but if people didn't want to go in, they sure don't have to. Everyone has their own personal opinion on this subject, and well, I've given you mine.
1347	4324	2	3	I think that any book or movie should have some clear warning signs upon it, to ensure that all people know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. Some movies or books that are read or watched should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people might not, and if taking all of the stuff out of movies or books, it might cause people not to go see or read as many movies or books. In a lot of music, some things might be offensive, but if you don't appreciate what they say in the song, then don't listen to that group. There are some rap artists that say some things people might not like, but you don't have to listen to them. There are a lot more bands and different kinds of music to choose from. It would be hard taking stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take away a lot of what the people want to see. In magazines, a lot of people, including me, like hearing the truth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies that a lot of people might not know. If parents don't like their children reading those kinds of books, have them go buy a set that they will enjoy having their kids read. In conclusion, a balanced approach of warning signs and personal choice is the best way to handle potentially offensive content in various media.
1348	4325	2	3	My name is @CAPS1 and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that is found offensive should be taken off the shelves. I have never come across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. I'm not the type of person who would start an argument, but I am a type of person who will speak what's on my mind and tell you what I believe in. People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books, that there will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries, such as stores like @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and etc. Like I said, I have never come across a book that I think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course I don't read a whole lot either. But the books I have read, I have never come across any that were terrible. Books that have content like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, can be pulled off the shelves. But if you have a child in the library, they shouldn't even be in the adult book section anyways; they should be in the kids book section. I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. Most authors are smarter than that, or at least I would hope so. Music is a whole story itself. In my opinion, if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music, then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that I would never let my children listen to it, but I know well enough if I don't want them to listen to it, then I'm not going to play it while they're around. I grew up around rap music, so that's all I listen to, but when I have kids, I know what they will be able to listen to and what they won't be able to listen to. Movies are the one that I have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as @ORGANIZATION1, and book stores, they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see, and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves, such as all the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies. The name of the movies aren't bad, but the movie itself is not for a child to see, so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it? Magazines and etc, I don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do, such as 'playboy and play girl'. But they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them, only adults can. The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out. I think I've said all I can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. I haven't had a lot of experience, but maybe that's because I don't have kids yet. I guess I will find out when I do have kids. I'm happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know. In conclusion, a careful consideration of what is appropriate for different audiences should guide the decision - making on censorship in libraries and other media.
1349	4326	2	3	Library Censorship. Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves. Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the key reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive. Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid', then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should gently remove their child from that area and take them to another area. The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, they should show them another bookshelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child might enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child might be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting. The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people clearly know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people might think is inappropriate for them to read, they should go to a different area. Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain', then they should closely observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense. In conclusion, a combination of parental, librarian, and personal responsibility can ensure a healthy reading environment in libraries without the need for strict censorship.
1350	4327	2	3	I think that @CAPS4 is fine if you take them out. You should be @NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad, they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1. I have read some books that are really good, but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @CAPS3 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' and @CAPS4 is really sad. @CAPS4 is about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad, but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4. Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the TV because they think that they are bad. I was watching this TV show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4, but I do. I'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell. Some movies are better if they have bad things in them; @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie than a kid movie. I watched them before though. In conclusion, while there should be age - appropriate restrictions on certain content, personal choice also plays an important role for those who are old enough to make informed decisions.
1351	4328	2	3	No, the books and other materials should not be moved because anyone can be interested in them. Someone could enter the library looking for any of those items and be unable to find them because the library removed them. First, there will be no valid reason for removing the books from the library unless a significant number of new books and other materials are coming in. Everyone has different interests in various materials, such as books and other related items. That's why I firmly say do not remove the items. People might come to the library searching for a specific book they desire. If that person cannot find it, they might complain, or take their business elsewhere. Then the library could start losing business. Second, if the library starts losing business, it might be forced to close down. Then, if the library closes, the people who frequently visit there won't have a place to study, work, or engage in other activities. What if those people don't have transportation? They will not be able to reach another library. The owner of the library can lose money if it closes down because not everyone has computers and books at home. They can come to the library to do their research and rent books. Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is their only suitable place. Little children go to the library looking for books and other materials, and if they can't find the book they want, they might start crying. If they start crying, people who are working can be disturbed. Then that person or those people who are disturbed might leave and never come back, and that means money lost. Students' schools might not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library, but the library doesn't have it, so that student won't have access to the required book. In conclusion, these are some reasons and examples why I don't believe the books and other materials should be taken out of the library. Someone can be really interested in those items and come to the library to search for them but can't find them, which would be a great loss for both the patrons and the library.
1352	4329	2	3	You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you notice some eye - catching advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to carefully read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you firmly believe should not even be available in a public library, for they are far too inappropriate and offensive. What would you do? Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, which you believe is offensive, you should take action and say something. Talk to the librarian and clearly state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework and study is just plain wrong. What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even understand what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disastrous! I do not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inappropriate or offensive, their parents would be having a serious and major talk with the librarian. Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by whom. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just for checking out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older. I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians' desk. This way, no one who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need to provide proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials. Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, etc., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction. This is how it is at my neighborhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials. In conclusion, implementing proper restrictions in libraries is crucial for creating a safe and appropriate environment for all patrons, especially young children.
1353	4330	2	3	I believe that some materials in the library should be taken off. Some people may find them offensive because they might contain bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language in them, and people don't want little kids to stumble upon them. If a little kid saw that kind of stuff, then they would learn bad things. And they might say it in front of everybody, and then it could spread, and more people might start using such language. A lot of books are okay to read because they don't have bad content in them. Some people like reading books that have drama, and some people don't. Most books are okay to read. But some can have inappropriate language in them and shouldn't be allowed in the library. However, they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. If people don't want to read them, then they should simply not get them. Some movies have bad stuff in them. That kind of content should not be in the library because a lot of people don't want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would walk in there and get one, and if it had that inappropriate stuff, and the parent found out, then the library could get sued for having that kind of material. So they should be taken out of the library so people won't accidentally get them. The library can keep children's movies in there to watch because they are not bad. If I worked at a library, then I would take magazines out. Sports magazines would be okay to keep in there. But a lot of the other ones should not be there because they have a lot of bad things in them, and I wouldn't let people take them, so I wouldn't have them in there. But sports - related magazines are okay because sports are not bad for people to read. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read. That is just what I think. Other people might see it the other way, and they can. People are different, and they will think different things. Some people might want to read that kind of content, and some people don't. So it just shows you that people are different because they think things differently than other people do. And some libraries have that kind of stuff, and some don't. So if you are one of those people that like that kind of stuff, then go to one of the libraries that have it. And if you are one of those people that don't, then go to one that doesn't have that kind of stuff so you can get what you want, and they can get what they want. In conclusion, libraries should consider the diverse preferences of their patrons and make appropriate decisions regarding the materials they stock.
1354	4331	2	3	I have seen some truly offensive books on the shelves of libraries. Books that make you worry about what would happen if a child of a young, impressionable age, say 5, 8, or 10, looked at these books since that is when their mind absorbs the most knowledge. But what if this knowledge was offensive to a race of people or a person's religion? These children are the future of our species. This kind of content should be censored in libraries. Try to imagine if they had looked at books written by Hitler and other Nazi members during Nazi Germany's rule. Maybe they looked at a book by Ted Bundy or other famous killers. If they saw a photo - book about the massive Jewish death camps in Europe. Movies that show war - torn battles such as Stalingrad, Normandy, World War I, or World War II. The famous movie 'The Schindler's List', a movie based on the cruelty of the Nazis and the Holocaust. This is my view on censorship to protect children from the offensive things in or on books, music, movies, magazines. There should be censorship in all things that children can access. Imagine the world where there were no controls on what they could be exposed to through the media. In conclusion, protecting children from offensive and harmful content in libraries is of utmost importance to ensure their healthy mental and moral development.
1355	4332	2	3	The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed access to the library. It provides everyday people with the information that they are actively seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc., they can all be easily found there. Since they are all available, censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Genres were created for a valid reason. Certain items have different characteristics and forms. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some well - known examples. Since music is categorized in such a detailed way, there should be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be simply avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive. In the United States, the American people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one of the most important ones. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear the nation apart. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason, any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library. Another freedom given to the American people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasizing about school, it is all within the legal boundaries. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that are truly unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what. Movies are also located at libraries. They are categorized just as comprehensively as books and music. The term 'Don't judge a book by its cover' is true sometimes. This can also be applied to movies. The title of a movie or book will give an indication of what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated R or PG - 13. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated R movie. It is illegal, however, to check one out to a child of a young age. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to video - games, there are ratings and genres. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment, they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc., inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem. In conclusion, maintaining an uncensored library environment respects the rights of the patrons and allows for a diverse range of information and entertainment to be accessible.
1356	4333	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I firmly do not think it should matter whether we have music, movies, or magazines in the library. Some people genuinely like to come into the library to relax, perhaps sitting quietly in a corner to look at a magazine or listen to some soothing music. I truly do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there. If it is not causing any disturbance to them, then it should not bother anybody else. I often see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music simultaneously. It really does not bother me when they do this. It is clearly a way for them to drown out the world and fully enjoy a good book. There is only one valid reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library. It is that some people unfortunately get very loud when they are looking at magazines, or when their music is turned up way too loud. Other than that minor issue, I do not think we should restrict those types of materials in the libraries. I am an avid reader myself and I deeply like to read in peace. So I enjoy listening to my music while I am reading. I also like to flip through magazines every once in a while. It is truly very relaxing to me. Those are my well - founded reasons on why it should not matter whether we have those types of materials in the library.
1357	4334	2	3	Do I think that books, movies, music, or magazines should be removed from the library? No, I definitely don't. I firmly believe that they should be removed only under extremely rare circumstances because if you remove them, you're probably going to lose a significant number of customers. I'm going to be completely honest here. Most people have a genuine love for reading. I know that I sometimes read to study, and if they got rid of the books that I rely on to study, I'd be at a complete loss. How would I study? Even teachers frequently go to the library to study or to borrow books, or maybe to get books for their grandchildren or their own kids. Parents do the exact same thing. People often don't understand that music is a great help to everybody at some point in time. I know quite a few people who listen to music to help them concentrate on different things like homework, regular work, or even when they're feeling stressed out. There are a great many different ways that music benefits a large number of people. If people decided to feel offended over such useful things, then there is clearly something wrong with them because after all these years, there have been no legitimate complaints. Honestly, I have never borrowed movies or magazines from the library before. People usually do it for their kids or grandchildren. I really don't see the big deal. It's not like they are watching anything inappropriate. They mostly have family - friendly kid movies, not anything bad. Why would people want to take such little pleasures away from little kids? In a way, it makes me quite angry because I have a soft spot for little kids as they don't hurt anybody.
1358	4335	2	3	Did you know that libraries are like treasure troves, containing books, movies, music, magazines, etc.? Yes! They truly have it all. If you ever need something for research or a school project, just head right there. But if there is something in the library that you do not like, it's simple: just keep going. I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I firmly believe that if it is something that offends you, then you should just ignore it and move on. That 'something' that might offend you could actually be very helpful to others. So, now you know that if you ever see something that you don't like in the library, just calmly walk away. It could be a valuable resource for you and others. If things offend you, and you try to remove them, how would the next person learn? They simply won't. We shouldn't only think about ourselves; we need to think about others in the situation as well. By allowing a diverse range of materials in the library, we ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.
1359	4336	2	3	I don't believe that we should censor or take away anything from our library shelves that seems either offensive or inappropriate for viewers. However, I wouldn't recommend it for the kids who are not ready for that sort of material until they reach the age where they are mature enough for that kind of viewing. The reason why I say this is because I firmly believe and know that people sooner or later are going to see, hear, and go through that sort of viewing and/or experience sometime in their lives. It has happened to many people in the past, and it will continue to happen to everyone in their lives. The events that occur in the world are often awful but yet are undeniably true. The harsh realities that go around in the world should be known to other people and why, so people can know how to deal with the situation or at least know what to do. We should know how to react when certain events take place. For example, if a certain person of a particular race is minding his own business and passes a group of racists, and they begin offending him with hurtful words, then he shouldn't worry. Because if a person is only going to constantly use words, then you should know that he/she is just a weak person trying to get on your nerves and won't do any physical harm to you. There are many unpleasant realities that people don't like and try their best to hide it from others. But that would only make the situation worse for everybody and would leave them clueless if some people got exposed to what some people attempt to hide. We shouldn't hide the truth from others and keep them from knowing what has happened or what is going on, leaving them in the dark. I believe that nothing should be held back for the people who are ready to see or know what is going on, no matter how cruel or painful it is. They should know what it is and how to take care of themselves when they experience it firsthand. By facing these realities, we can better prepare ourselves for the challenges of life.
1360	4337	2	3	Censoring History We all know that language is the very foundation of human legacy. Language is spoken to precisely convey anything the speaker is trying to communicate. To take books from the shelves is equivalent to stealing the words from the mouths of many great speakers. We have a solemn obligation to keep the history that we have created alive. If something is forgotten, it is as if it never happened. And if it seems like nothing happened, it will reoccur - whether it is good or bad. To hide away words from our children is a grave mistake. If not by reading from a book, word - of - mouth will surely lead them to the same discoveries as they would have made if reading it from a book. But even more importantly, what good is there in hiding the truth? When many speak of tragic incidences, they often say, 'Let us not forget.' If we should not forget, why should the youth be prevented from learning? There is nothing in print that cannot be conveyed in a different communication form. Our history is vividly written on the pages of literature. The books we read are the precious property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us about our past mistakes as well as our glorious triumphs. A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' is a novel that realistically displays what life was truly like in one of America's most racially barbaric times. One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times. To counter this argument, one might point out that Jim, the black slave that stood by Huck was deeply loved by Huck. A book in that time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground - breaking feat. The 'n' word was common place in that time period - a friendship between a black man and a white man was not. Is it really important that a child knows of just another offensive word that they are bound to discover eventually anyway, or is it more important that they learn that the color of skin does not change a person? Do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away. To take one book away is to set a dangerous precedent of taking all of them away. Censoring one piece of literature opens the floodgates of debate for every other piece ever created. The world has witnessed what can happen when things get censored. During Hitler's dictatorship, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspapers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the dictatorship wanted got through. The people were brainwashed, and those who were not rose up, and when they did, they were brutally shot down. Do not let the world come to such a disastrous state. We are better than that, and our literature clearly shows it. In other words, to censor media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of the education and freedoms that are absolutely critical to the well - being of future generations. Do not hide the free speech of authors. Do not hide our history from our children. Do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before. Let us educate our children for the future of humanity. Let our history not repeat itself. Let us innovate and create a new, better world. Let us allow our words to flow freely. Let us allow our legacy to live on and continue to inspire generations to come.
1361	4338	2	3	The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right, and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies, shouldn't be on a children's shelf to read, but rather on an adult shelf. I believe every author has his or her right to express oneself and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect, even if we don't agree on their beliefs. If every book that was found offensive was taken off a shelf, we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain things offensive. Many children are interested in certain things, and we can't hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes against family morals or values, such as religious beliefs. It would be a good thing to monitor what your children are reading, watching, and listening to. On the other hand, adult shelves will have many different things that would be offensive to many different people, unlike children's books. Writing is a way to show a person's expressions and what they stand for, although it may not be pleasing to me or any other person. But what if we write a book and somebody does not like it? Then we wouldn't like it if they took it off the shelf. That would show disrespect to a person who has thought long and hard on their work. Learn to stand proud on what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe, family-type of books, music, and magazines. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects both individual beliefs and the freedom of expression is essential for a healthy literary and cultural environment.
1362	4339	2	3	I'm against censorship for good reasons. Everyone is for censorship, well, I'm on a different perspective. If you're not old enough to get a movie or a book, that's for a reason. On another note, if you are, then it shouldn't matter. People should have their own choice. If they want to go out and get a rated [specific rating] movie and watch it with their kids, that's their own choice. It's definitely not the person who makes the movies' choice to censor cusswords and stuff out. That's why they make edited CDs so people can buy them instead. People have different beliefs, and whatever they believe in is how it should go. And if somebody else with different beliefs doesn't like that, then I guess they need to write a paragraph like I'm doing now. Also, people want everything censored out. Eventually, there isn't going to be nothing to read, watch, or listen to. So all you people that want everything to be censored, I hope you're happy when the world has nothing to do because of you. In conclusion, respecting individual choices and freedom of expression is crucial, and over - censorship will lead to a dull and restricted cultural landscape.
1363	4340	2	3	Censorship for the future kids of America. Personally, I have read some disturbing books and also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated [specific rating] movies. Not even talking about all the messed - up music I've heard so far in my lifetime. What it comes down to is a lot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. Books, anyone can get from a public library, and some are about murder, rape, gang violence, and all the horrible reality of the devilish deeds in the world. I personally don't have a kid, but if I had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated [specific rating] movie, I would wanna file a complaint because that's not how I want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out of his mouth. Also, I wouldn't want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out of his mouth. But the [specific organization] needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until they're old enough to go get it on their own, like they need to be [specific age] to go see a rated [specific rating] movie. That is how it should have always been. In conclusion, proper censorship and age - appropriate access to media are necessary to ensure the healthy development of future generations.
1364	4341	2	3	I feel that materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some [specific group] like offensive things that they have in the library. Some [specific group] would sometimes want to know about certain things that are offensive. Most [specific group] could be offended by a lot of different things. Different [specific group] have different things that are offensive. What might be offensive to you probably isn't offensive to me. [Specific group] that don't like offensive things just shouldn't check it out, and [specific group] that like offensive things just could check it out. I feel that they just shouldn't be removed just because [specific group] don't like offensive things. They just shouldnt check it out. You just can't remove things that are offensive just because some [specific group] don't like offensive things. Everyone does have their own right, but some [specific group] like offensive things. I read a book that was offensive to me, but it told me how to react to the situation and how to overcome my situation. So some things may offend you, but some things you just have to read about it more because some things tell you how to overcome that situation or it will tell you what to do about the situation you had been offended by. That's why I feel that you shouldn't remove offensive books. In conclusion, allowing access to a diverse range of materials, even those that may be offensive to some, can provide valuable learning opportunities and respect individual preferences.
1365	4342	2	3	Moving [specific direction] The [specific entity] [specific category] In [specific place]! When you enter a library or a book store, of course, you will find [specific category] that you like and dislike. Your opinion may not be the same as someone else. Sometimes you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way things are going. People have different views about different [specific category] in this [specific context]. You are going to come across good [specific category], bad things, happy [specific category], sad [specific category], [specific category] you agree about, and [specific category] you disagree about. I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody. The reason I state that is because if any of those items offend one person, they might not be offensive to another. Different people have different interests in many different [specific category]. So therefore, there should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves, especially if they are not hurting anything or anyone physically. Speaking from personal experience, there were many times I felt offended about certain [specific category]. I feel that abortions can come off a bit harmful to a [specific entity] that has not been born yet. Killing a child that has not experienced the things you have is not right. But sometimes the way I can feel can be a lot different from other people. So who am I to tell another person what they can and can not do? That comes with voicing your own opinion. You can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling. If you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with, it is crazy. Think about the [specific entity] situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you. It will be a lot of times you will disagree or have an opinion but can not change or do anything about it. [Specific category] will be much easier and less [specific negative aspect] if we sometimes deal with the difficult [specific category] in [specific place]. In conclusion, accepting the diversity of opinions and the presence of potentially offensive materials is an important part of a free and inclusive cultural environment.
1366	4343	2	3	No, they should not have the CDs, books, and other items off the store shelves. They should leave them on the shelves. I think they should only remove the old video games, along with old books and music. Every other item should remain. In conclusion, keeping a wide variety of items on the store shelves allows customers to have more choices and find what they need.
1367	4344	2	3	In many public libraries across the nation, a large number of: books, magazines, movies, and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and may find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries, and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays? Everybody is different in their own way, and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy, and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library don't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if there is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in public libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests, so they should have everything open in libraries. There is a reason that public libraries are called public. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a public library. That would be why there is such a thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the 'adult restricted' section of your library. For example, Stephen King, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the 'adult restricted' sections or even the'restricted' section. It should be up to the children's parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself. I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different, and has their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine, or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the public. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the adult restricted section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big warning to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself. In conclusion, maintaining a diverse collection in public libraries respects the individuality and interests of all patrons.
1368	4345	2	3	Should books, magazines, etc. really be censored and taken off a shelf in a library just because you might find them offensive? Some of you who are reading this would say yes, but why? What would be the reason behind it? So, to answer the first question I asked, my answer would have to be no because a library is a public place for all ages, and each area is labeled or should be labeled with the genre of the book, magazine, etc. it contains. I myself read almost just about everything I can get my hands on, and for some people, it's the same way. Yes, I understand that if it is offensive to you, you probably would feel they should censor it, but what about those for whom it isn't offensive? What would you say to them? How would you explain why it was offensive? Most of all, how would you react if they held it against you? If it was because of one person or a small group of people that one of my favorite books or series was censored, in all honesty, I would be pretty angry. Books are for everyone to read; they shouldn't be unable to read the books they love because they have been taken off the shelf. I think that if a person really doesn't like the book and finds it offensive, they should then just ignore it and move on to find another book. They shouldn't have looked at it in the first place. Books will be offensive to someone somehow. Usually, a book is written to target a certain group of people. For instance, what if someone found the romance novels that a lot of people love offensive? What if that was all the person read? Well, the people who only read romance novels wouldn't have a book to read because someone had them censored and taken off the shelves. Books have been written to help teach, get away from the real world, create a place to go for a person with an imagination, give someone hope, mystery, and excitement. Books aren't something that should be taken off a library shelf; they are a bit of something for someone who just loves to read. Yes, there would be books you don't want your kids, grandkids, nieces, and nephews to read, but that can't be helped. You can't censor every book that you don't want them to read or find offensive for them. If you did, there wouldn't be a single book on a library shelf. So, for those of you who have read this, think about it. When you pick up a book and find it offensive, do you want to make someone else upset because you had it taken off the shelf? You never know when that might happen to you. Think about it before you go and try to do that to a book. In conclusion, censorship in libraries limits the reading choices of others and goes against the inclusive nature of libraries.
1369	4346	2	3	I don't believe that any certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the libraries' shelves because anything can be offensive. What if someone needed to research about a particular historical event? Well, they really won't be able to if all the books about that event were taken off the shelves just because someone found it offensive. Nowadays, everything is offensive to somebody. For this, people need to understand that it is what it is, and if you were not part of that problem, then what do you need to worry about. This day and age is full of challenges all around the world. There are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offended. Just like all the earthquakes around the world, I know that there are some people who are offended by that, but what if somebody was in college and they wanted to learn more about what happened so maybe they can get a group of people and make their lives better. People are hurting, and I understand that, but we people are not here to judge. We are here to help the poor and the sick get by with what they have and just help them see that there is a way out. With all this said, I don't believe that we should remove the books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves in libraries. In conclusion, keeping all materials on library shelves ensures that people have access to the information they need for various purposes.
1370	4347	2	3	When I go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic. The information I want is the facts that really happened or took place. This would not be possible if they censored all the material that offended somebody. Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading or researching. It is important for readers and researchers to connect and take in all the information they read. That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing. Authors write the things they write for a reason. Taking their hard work off the shelves because some little thing offends someone is not fair to them. Besides, either way, someone is getting offended because the author is going to get offended for having his hard work taken off the shelves. As you can tell, I am against censoring our libraries. The way I see it is that if something offends you, then don't look at it. In conclusion, maintaining an uncensored library environment respects the rights of both authors and readers.
1371	4348	2	3	I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their beliefs or ideas, as these are integral expressions of individuality. If certain books found offensive were to be removed from libraries, then there would be hardly anything left for anyone to read. After all, different people have different sensibilities, and what one finds offensive, another may cherish. If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read, then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion, children should be able to read whatever they like, and by doing that, they can teach themselves many things. Books can also help children to escape from everyday life. Admittedly, children should not always escape or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionally they need to. I know as a young child when things were not going so well, I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things. If children are allowed these escapes, they can do better on their school work and with their peers. Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations. If a child reads a couple of times a day, it is proven that said child will do better in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination? It is impossible! In recent online polls, parents whose children can access books say that their children do better in school and in everyday life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies. With this knowledge, they can learn with less difficulty and can excel in academics with ease. In conclusion, if certain books are censored from the libraries, they will be unavailable for children to read. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life. Do not let libraries censor books!
1372	4349	2	3	Some materials in libraries, especially those published recently, have information that is offensive towards others. But should they be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is. But materials should be removed if it is a sexual, racist, or life - threatening offense. Some material might have offensive comments that are sexual. If it's an offense that is explicit and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that could be a good reason for the material to be removed. It might make the person feel emotions that bring them down, like shame or disgust. It might also make the person feel violated and offended. There could be material that has racist comments. Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today. It is something that starts fights and arguments. It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves. Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also. So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed. There are some materials that might have an offense that seems life - threatening. Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that might seem like the nation would be in danger, someone might feel offended and want that material removed. Material with too much threat in it might make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen. They would feel a life - threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves. So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves? Yes, they should. If they were to be found to have a sexual, life - threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life - threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions.
1373	4350	2	3	Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech. There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard. An author's opinions might be offensive to some, but does that mean he or she should not have a voice? Writers get their ideas from somewhere, and society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjure up. Taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly, citizens of the country have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book, don't check it out. Writers might state things that to some degree might offend one in a million people. Others see it as freedom of speech and writing. An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second - graders. But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world, walking out their front door will show that same thing. Some books might be fictional, but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else. Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers. So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it, they got it from the way people truly are in the world. Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provocative language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex. Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways. If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves, society still will not change. There is no perfect society. Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone. If an individual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing, that person should not check that author's books out from the library. No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by. Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers. If the reader does not like the book, they are able to close it. No one has glued their fingers to it. Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to. Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things. Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if someone does not like a book, they should not read it.
1374	4351	2	3	One could understand why some would wish to censor libraries and remove all rude, unwanted, or offensive forms of media from their shelves. After all, no one wants their loved ones to be exposed to something distasteful. However, one must take into account that, as Katherine Paterson said, if one person has 'the right to remove that [a] book from the shelf...then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' With that thought in mind, do we honestly think that censorship of libraries is a smart idea? If everyone was able to pick and choose which books to be taken off the shelf or which music to ban, then we would have nothing left. You simply cannot please everyone. Are there benefits? Of course there are benefits. One certainly wouldn't want one's child exposed to certain material at a young age. But one must not censor libraries! If one wishes, as a responsible parent, that their child keep away from a particular book or movie, they should take that matter into their own hands and not condemn the book off the shelf. By condemning the book, one condemns the author. As an American, one has the freedom of speech, and this applies to media as well. The author has the right to author a book that some might view as offensive, and no one has the right to remove his or her right from the standing. Paper burns at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. In the classic novel by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451, the protagonist struggles through life in a world antagonized by the banning and burning of books. The story takes place in the future; however, it contains an interesting undertone that hints at the possibility that this 'future' might be nearer than first imagined. To be blunt, the protagonist's life is horrible. He lives in a world that bans books, yet he is quite the bibliophile. He is employed as a fireman, not to clear fires, but to create them. Bradbury's firemen are responsible for the delicate task of book burning, which is a rather frequent occurrence. However, with the main character's love for literature, how can he burn books? Throughout the novel, the character tries to come to terms with himself and attempts to put an end to the madness, only to be forced out of civilized society. The book is frightening, but an amazing read: it emphasizes the dire reality of censorship. It's everywhere. Now, one certainly doesn't need to worry about Bradbury's futuristic hell coming to life any time soon. But one should know the dangers of censorship. No one person has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they feel is offensive, let alone ban it entirely. The banning of books is a banning of freedom: freedom of speech, freedom of ideas, freedom of thought. Another dystopian world that comes to mind is the world of George Orwell's 1984. Though, granted, our society is certainly not headed for that any time soon, if ever: it is still a valid point. Once some freedoms are removed, others will follow. Libraries should remain entirely intact, forever. Every person, every man, woman, and child should have ample access to knowledge. Whether this knowledge be gained through books, magazines, movies, or music, it needs to be readily available. Instead of banning certain media, one should label said media with a warning. Parents should have enough sense to pay attention, and thus, the problem is solved.
1375	4352	2	3	There are many books out there that parents would not want their children reading. Some books have violence and crimes, others have love and romance. But it is not the best idea to use censorship in libraries. There are many books out there that might not be good for children to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life. For example, a book about crime might teach them about the consequences of bad actions. Also, we can not forget about freedom of the press. With freedom of the press, anyone can write about anything they want. They can write about the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance. Everyone has their own way of writing and their own imagination. Without imagination, what fiction would there be for children to read? There would be nothing to write about without imagination. With censorship, there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read. If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves, there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor. Whether it is swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love, there is something in every book that is inappropriate for children to read. If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves, there would be nothing left to read, and the intelligence of children would drop dramatically. Children read for many reasons, like to expand their minds and to enter a world where the book takes place. But what children might not know is that reading also strengthens their vocabulary. When children read, they learn many new words that are in that book. While they are reading, the book opens their mind to much more than what they are used to and normally around everyday. When they are reading, the children expand their minds and also helps them with everyday situations. This is why I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a great idea. If libraries censor books and everything else on the shelves, there would be nothing left for children at the libraries. They would be stuck reading books where they do not learn anything. They would read the same books over and over, they wouldn't learn anything new. There wouldn't be anything they could expand their minds with. That is something we certainly do not want for our community or anywhere for that matter.
1376	4353	2	3	The scary book that you don't want your children to pick up off the shelf. I think if your kids read it, they would be extremely scared, having terrifying nightmares, and you probably don't want that. And if you have the right to move it, your kids will have the right to move it because they see what you do and they're gonna want to do the same. So you can do it when they are not around. And yes, I believe that certain materials should be carefully managed to protect children from unnecessary fear and discomfort.
1377	4354	2	3	"Have you ever picked up a piece of material while in a library and it deeply offended you? Would you want your children reading, watching, or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them? I don't think any parent wants that. Think about it, how do children have easy access to things like that? Is it all around in plain sight or do children actively go and find it? Not every single child in @LOCATION1 is going to be fully protected from bad materials. Most of the time after school, children stay in the house and engage in various activities instead of going outside. Inside of their house they have access to television, computers, and music. They think, ""Why go outside when I have all this stuff inside?"" Truth be told, children hear so many harmful things from everywhere and anywhere. Nothing is censored like it was back in the day. Now a days, nobody seems to care if materials are offensive, just as long as they sell. That's not the way it's supposed to be at all. Everybody should want the best for the children and young teens. People wonder why there is violence, bad attitudes, crimes, etc., because of all the stuff we have access to. Schools could help prevent this problem by thoroughly removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries. It's really sad that such type of material is available in a school, but that's how the generation is today. In a library, only certain things should be done, like reading, using computers for educational purposes, and working at a table. Children shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games, or listen to music with bad words in it, or perhaps pick up a dirty magazine. A library should be a pure place for learning, doing work, and reading. If there is less offensive materials in a school environment, that's one significant step into fixing this problem. Censorship is much needed everywhere, as it would help out a great deal."
1378	4355	2	3	The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand. Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free and unrestricted access to all media - related materials, we take away the precious opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, the unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of a proper and clear - cut definition for 'offensive', and the blatant contradiction censorship poses to the very core of what a library is. The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both firmly protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively and severely undermine both of these rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the large number of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that @CAPS1 have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their unique ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Censoring library materials would be unjustly limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the @LOCATION1. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries. The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries. The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non - offensive environment through the strict limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a sharp clash with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new and valuable information if someone else did not like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre - conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship. All in all, we can clearly see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be severely ravaged. We cannot, as @CAPS1 with rights, employ a system of censorship.
1379	4356	2	3	I think kids should be able to read what they want. Kids should never get told no when it comes to learning. Plus, there is not a truly bad book that your kids will find at school anyway. Why should kids not be able to watch and read what they want? This is how we learn and grow. Unless it was of adult content, which would be against the law for them to get. haha. Our kids' minds are not something we should waste on things that they don't want to read anyway. When a kid starts to hate his or her work, it starts a long chain of hating school and the books inside it. So, we should encourage kids' free exploration in reading within the legal and appropriate boundaries.
1380	4357	2	3	I don't think that certain materials in books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because I firmly think that everyone has the right to say what they want to say. However, I do think some things in books, movies, and music that might be appropriate for a high school student aren't appropriate for an elementary school student. Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students. It would just depend on what they are reading, watching, and hearing. I've never experienced anything offensive in what I've read in any book before, but I have experienced some in the music I've heard. I didn't say really anything about it. I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to, and I didn't think it would really be that bad. It's mostly in rap music that I've heard that's really offensive, and I think it shouldn't have been even written. But I still firmly think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say. We should respect the freedom of expression while also being aware of the different sensitivities of different age groups.
1381	4358	2	3	We all have our favorite books, and there are some that we like more than others. In certain months (@MONTH1), our preferences might shift. Have you ever walked into the library, filled with hope of finding that all - time favorite book that you've nearly forgotten about, or perhaps a book a friend recommended to you? What happens when you get there and discover that the book has been censored? Most of the books we see in our public or school libraries are well - liked or are favorites of many. Books open a brand - new world to everyone and should not be taken away. To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe that the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because they could be offensive to some people due to racial slurs or inappropriate comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago are set in a long - gone era. Take @PERSON1 for example. In today's context, it might be considered offensive, but this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in that time period. Without it, some people would never know what happened, and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future. Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has their preference on books, and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others might not like. If all books that are considered bad or offensive were taken off the shelves, then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there, no matter how horrendous it might be. Besides, you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics, it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book, they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them. I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone; it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended, then they shouldn't read it. It's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully, I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want.
1382	4359	2	3	Killings, murders, and homosexual - themed books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken away. That is like saying I get offended by homework, so we should take it out of @ORGANIZATION2. Some of the most interesting books to read, in my opinion, are about murders. I believe they shouldn't be taken out; otherwise, no teenage kids would read in @ORGANIZATION1. Teenagers like to have mystery and romance in their reading. I know that one of my favorite books, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, would offend some people because it has murder in it. That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me. They can just overlook these books and pick another. If you want to keep your @ORGANIZATION2 students interested, you shouldn't take out books that might offend someone. By taking out some books, not everyone would be happy. Some kids might not even read anymore because you took the best books out of the library. Every book, in one way or another, would offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and read a different one. I have seen some books at my @ORGANIZATION2 that offended me, but I did not tell the librarian to take it out of the @ORGANIZATION2. Another student might have loved to read that book. Everyone has different opinions, so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones. The only books that would be left would be @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and children books. I do not know of any @ORGANIZATION2 student that would want to read @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and give a speech about it in class. I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports anymore; all the books we read in class could offend someone. If everything that offended someone was taken out of the school, there would be nothing left of the @ORGANIZATION2. See, everyone has a different opinion on everything. That just isn't right. In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and libraries. They keep the @ORGANIZATION2 students reading and growing. Without some of these books, I myself wouldn't like reading. So let's be mature adults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us.
1383	4360	2	3	Censoring any type of media such as books, magazines, movies, or music from a library is not right. A library is a huge repository of information, a common place where people can seek out knowledge. When something is found offensive, you should not hide it away as though it never existed. If any media is offensive, it should be up to the person who is looking up the information to choose if he/she wants to use it. When someone, for example, a child, comes across something offensive, the first thought is often to take it away from the library or television. Instead, one should just explain what they are looking at, and they will eventually understand the reason it is offensive. But how does someone know what is offensive or not? Just because something is found offensive by one or two people does not make it right to just take it away. It should be talked about or discussed by groups of people on the subject, and then a decision should be made whether or not it should be taken off the shelves for being offensive. If there is a book or magazine on the shelf and it might be offensive, it should be a decision made by the people surrounding that type of information to take it off the shelf and not to be hidden away. In the end, we should respect the diversity of opinions and the value of information, and not hastily censor media just because it might offend a few.
1384	4361	2	3	Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyway, whether we take it away or not. Offensive material, such as cursing or expressions of rage, is a form of expression and a way of relieving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression. Children will see and hear offensive things regardless. Even as it is now, parents try to hide such things from their children, which makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hide it, the more children will seek it out. In movies, books, and music, offensive material is a form of expression. It relieves stress, shows rage, and presents a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagine someone truly angry in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing or fully convey the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will perish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' Here, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him. In such ways, offensive material can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it explicitly. Offensive material can also convey grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story and allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher, or listener would wait for more and engage with the music, book, or movie. It puts interest into the material. Only certain people can agree on something being offensive, such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But offensive material applies foreshadowing, interest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyway? Something that interests them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would we remove something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would attract and keep some engaged within it? In conclusion, we should accept that offensive material has its place in creative works and not be too quick to censor it.
1385	4362	2	3	Do you think that something should be taken off the book shelf just because it offended someone or you disliked it? I don't think so. Just because you don't like something or you don't approve of the reading material doesn't mean it should be taken away. If it was like that in a particular time (@DATE1), then there wouldn't be any reading material, no books or magazines left. In my opinion, if a book offends you in some way or another, then simply don't read it. It's as plain and simple as that. Because I'm sure that there are thousands of books, magazines, newspapers, etc., that offend a lot of people every day. I don't mean to be harsh in any way; that's just the way I feel. This is only my opinion on this situation. We should respect the diversity of reading materials and not let personal sensitivities lead to the removal of valuable books from the shelves.
1386	4363	2	3	"Have you ever thought about why teenagers are changing each day? Sometimes parents don't pay attention to why that is happening, because they think their kids are growing up, or because they need more freedom, or even because they need more time. When time passes, they stop and think, ""What happened to my kids? Why are they changing so much?"" But they don't know why we behave like that. You have to stop that, because we are changing because of what we see in magazines, movies, and books, and also music. Sometimes music has offensive words that we learn.  But also, music, books, magazines, and movies are good, but when they don't have offensive words or bad things in them. Sometimes they affect us in a good way, but the majority of the time they affect us in a bad way because we learn bad things. Sometimes little kids read books with bad and offensive words.  I remember when my friend and I were @NUM1 years old, she started reading books with offensive words, and her mom got mad at her. After that, she started insulting her mom and calling her names, and her mom was feeling bad, but she didn't know why her daughter was acting bad. The next day, I went to their house and I told her mom that she was reading bad books and watching movies with offensive words, and I told her mom where she was hiding all those books and movies.  When she got home, I was there, and her mom had all the books and movies in her hand. She gave me a bad look and she told me that I was a bad friend because I told her mom. I started crying because she made me feel bad, but she didn't know that I was doing it for her own good.  Before I moved to the @LOCATION1, she went to my home and she said, 'I am sorry because I treated you like that', and I told her that I did it because I loved her and because she was like my sister since we were little. We started crying. Now we are still best friends. These days, little kids know everything, and it is because of what they watch and see.  You can help us by taking all of the bad words and offensive words out of the books, movies, and magazines. Help us to become someone important in life, and create a better environment for our growth."
1387	4364	2	3	"Ok, some books can be really offensive, and some magazines can be bad. Like this one sports magazine I read talked about some athletes and their accidents. One article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basketball, and he had the stomach flu. He was having a hard time playing because he had to use the bathroom a lot. 'I mean, who would want to let the world know that they had an accident in the bathroom?' That's bad!  And another thing, why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them? There are quite a few books like that. For example, there's this book called 'Wake', and it's about a girl who gets pulled into other people's dreams. There was this girl who had a sexual dream. I thought, ""Wow, why is this book in here?"" It also had a lot of cursing in it. I enjoyed it, but I think it should be removed from the library. Because there are kids who aren't of age, so they shouldn't read them.  I don't know. That's all I have to say right now. Other than that, look at what your kids read these days; you might get upset. It's important to ensure that the reading materials available to kids are appropriate for their age and development."
1388	4365	2	3	Katherine stated that if everyone had the right to take a book off the shelf, then there wouldn't be any books left. I think what she is saying is that many people think a book is inappropriate, but in another person's eye, the book could also be appropriate. Censorship is a big deal nowadays. Nobody wants their young children to read about drugs and/or violence. I have many opinions upon this issue.  First, I will state why I think the books, or movies, or whatever should be taken off the shelf. The books, movies, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelf for being too inappropriate. The books and movies are inappropriate by having drugs, sex, violence, and many other things in them that young children shouldn't be subject to watching or reading. I know if I was a parent, I would not want my young child reading about a violent murder or gangs.  The other thing about censorship is that it is the people's choice to read an inappropriate book or watch an inappropriate movie. As a kid myself who is growing up, I didn't really care for reading anyway, but the books that were the best sometimes were the ones with violence in them. Also, even though the book may be inappropriate, the child still should have a say in what they are reading. This is where my next thought comes in. You have to think about the kids that are mature too. The kids that are mature, and it is just a hobby to read, may not have any books of their style left to read if they were all 'taken off the shelf'. This goes for parents too. If they have a book at their house, the child could easily pick it up and read it there.  What the book stores, libraries, and movie stores should do is put an age limit on the books and movies. I know that for @CAPS1 rated movies there is an age limit, but for explicit books, I do not think there is an age limit. They could also maybe even get a letter or a note with parent consent on it, so the children could get the book or magazine. Maybe the parent should even just come in and get the book or movie for the child. The libraries, or book stores, or movie stores could also easily put a warning on the side of the cover to show that the book may be inappropriate to some. What the children read is only up to two people: the child and the parent. If the parent doesn't care that the child is reading or watching an inappropriate movie, then it should be no problem.  Therefore, I think in order to withhold the buying and selling of books, there has to be the option to obtain the inappropriate ones. I feel that even though the material may be explicit, the kids, with their parent's consent, should have the option to check out or buy mostly anything. After all, the book may be about violence, drugs, or sex, but the children are still reading, which is always good. By finding a balance between access and protection, we can ensure a healthy reading environment for everyone.
1389	4366	2	3	I do agree with this topic at hand. Some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropriate or sometimes vulgar. Way too many people get away with way too many things in this day and age. Our society we live in is just a total wreck and a complete, utter disaster. Something has to be done to put an end to this madness.  Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropriate book on the shelf, it is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book. Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entertainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing. Why would we put them on a shelf to be publicly displayed? That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to.  I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip - hop music coming from my nine - year - old sister's room. I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutely awful. The singer was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol. I went in her room and turned it off and questioned her where she got the CD from. She replied 'the library.'  That's just another example of what I'm speaking about. If someone at the age of nine can check out a CD like that, then imagine what is available to me at the age of sixteen. Adolescents do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary. I'm just afraid for the next generation; what are they going to be listening to? What are they going to be reading?  And it's not just the library; it's everywhere! We can't even live a day of our lives in this society without hearing something bad on the radio, on TV, or even in public. Everywhere we turn is something bad or vulgar. So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit. We need to stand up for what's appropriate and what's right. By taking action now, we can strive to create a more positive and healthy cultural environment for future generations.
1390	4367	2	3	I don't believe that we should remove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons. This is the real world, and the things you read about or watch in a movie may be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see. Life is about learning new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere. The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them.  If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it, even though it is what many kids are reading about today. Of course, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics. If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well, welcome to life. Most books have a true story behind them, and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life. Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read.  Also, everyone today listens to music. We find music as a way to relax and have a good time whether you're riding in a car or at a party. Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them. Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs, but it is what many kids are listening to today. What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life.  Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media shouldn't be removed from libraries. Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete. We watch movies to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while. No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some may think they are inappropriate.  I strongly believe that removing any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other type of media would have a negative effect on a lot of people. You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people. How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed? What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore? By maintaining a diverse collection, we can respect different perspectives and promote a well - rounded learning experience for all.
1391	4368	2	3	I believe that the book that none of us read should not occupy a place on the shelf of any bookstore. In my view, if adults read it, it doesn't mean children should have access to it. Also, some of the music available on the shelves should be removed from all stores. Children under the age of @NUM1 should have no way to obtain certain rated - R music. Such music shouldn't be on the shelves where little kids can easily get hold of it.  Now, let's talk about the movies playing in some shows. No child under @NUM1 should be allowed to watch half of the things shown in movies. Children should not be exposed to the kind of content that adults are more likely to encounter. This is one of the reasons why young children often imitate the actions they see. The people who make certain movies need to consider how children might react to the content they create.  Most magazines sold today give children the wrong ideas. When magazines are filled with a lot of gossip, kids tend to think it's real or okay to act in such ways. This sends the wrong message to young children. As we know, kids these days believe whatever they think is right, and many of these magazines make things seem so real. In conclusion, we need to be more careful about what media children are exposed to, whether it's books, music, movies, or magazines.
1392	4369	2	3	I think people import books from Mexico. It's important that when we hope our people write well, having the right books is crucial. I really enjoy my book - reading time, especially when it becomes a part of my family's routine. Many people love reading books. A lot of people go to bookstores, and so do my family members. If you want more information, feel free to call me. Books are scored fairly in schools. If there are conventions to have a proper structure, it helps us benefit from the content. I appreciate books because they help many people look forward to something special, like a show or a party when it finally happens. Sometimes, when I came to school, I wasn't in the mood to read. So, I'd go to my room and start reading a book. Reading a good book is truly beneficial. I'd keep reading and really get into it. When I go on vacation, I always pack two books to read by the beach. When I get back to school, I still enjoy book - reading as part of my family's activities. Do you like reading books? Reading is good because it broadens our knowledge and enriches our lives.
1393	4370	2	3	"No, as an @CAPS1 citizen, I firmly believe that no materials should be removed. There are several reasons for my stance, and I hope that after people read this, they will agree with me. There are three main points supporting my opinion, and I'll list them below.  First and foremost, this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, as the national anthem says. So, if someone removes a book or movie from a library because they find it offensive, they are encroaching on one of my rights as an @CAPS1 citizen. The right they are interfering with is the right of freedom. I should have the freedom to walk into a library and pick any book I want. I should be able to go to a movie store and rent any movie I choose from the shelf. If they restrict my access to a movie or book, they are undermining my freedom, and this is something I cannot tolerate as an @CAPS1. I should have the liberty to read or watch whatever I decide.  This leads me to my next point. It's a simple and logical one. People have the choice to read or watch a movie. Just because it's available doesn't mean they have to engage with it. If someone dislikes a book, they can simply avoid it. If they don't like a movie, they can choose not to watch it. In my opinion, it's quite straightforward. If someone finds a book or movie offensive, they should leave it alone and not try to ruin it for everyone else. Just because a few people find a book offensive doesn't give them the right to remove it. There are millions of other people who might love that book, so why spoil it for everyone to please a few? They have the right to say no to reading or watching, but they don't have the right to deny others.  Finally, people claim that a book or movie should be removed because a child might access it and it's not appropriate for children. Well, I have to say it's the parents' responsibility to ensure that a child isn't reading or watching inappropriate content. If a child gets hold of a so - called ""bad"" book, it's the parents' job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completely remove a book or movie just because a child might get it.  In conclusion, I firmly oppose the removal of materials from libraries or stores. We should uphold our freedom of choice, and parents should take on the responsibility of guiding their children."
1394	4371	2	3	"Many people hold different views on various things, and there's not much that can be done about it. It's an inevitable part of life that no one can make everyone happy. I don't think offensive materials should be removed from libraries just because some people find them offensive. There are three main reasons for this stance.  The first reason is that removing offensive materials won't make everyone happy. Just because some people are offended by certain things doesn't mean everyone shares the same sentiment. People have the choice in libraries to pick out the books and other materials they like. There are countless books in libraries around the world, and people will always have something to be mad about, whether the materials are there or not. As the saying goes, ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Sometimes, people might see a ""suggestive"" cover and take offense, but that's not a valid reason to remove the book.  The second reason is that offensive materials are enjoyable for some people. There's a reason these materials are in the library - because some people appreciate them. If a book or magazine is never checked out, it's likely that the library will get rid of it. Clearly, there are people who read, listen to, or watch these materials. People get offended by things daily, and removing ""offensive"" materials from libraries won't solve the problem completely. It might help a little, but there will always be people who are easily offended.  The third reason is that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think there are offensive materials in the library doesn't mean others feel the same way. Taking away such materials is like making kids at school wear uniforms; it takes away freedom. We live in @LOCATION1, which is supposed to be a free country. It's not truly free when people remove books and movies because they're offensive to some. If you don't like it, don't read it. There's no harm in keeping the materials on the shelves.  In conclusion, despite the fact that some people may be offended, removing offensive materials from libraries isn't the solution. We should respect everyone's freedom of choice and opinion."
1395	4372	2	3	Some books are offensive, but not all of them. Unfortunately, some libraries have started to censor their book collections by removing books they think could be offensive. I firmly believe there should be no censorship in libraries.  One reason against library censorship is that a large number of good books are lost as a result. For example, some libraries don't carry @PERSON1's books because he uses curse words. Instead of completely removing these books, libraries should simply warn people about the language used.  Another reason is that books on different religions are often removed. I once witnessed a librarian throw away a book just because it was about the @CAPS1 religion. This is a terrible action as the @CAPS1 religion is extremely interesting, and many people will now never have the opportunity to learn about it.  A third reason is that removing books can end up offending some people. I heard about an @CAPS3 family complaining about a library for removing a book about the @CAPS3 religion. It's upsetting because everyone should have access to the books they want.  I propose that instead of censorship, libraries should separate books by different subjects and genres and put up signs warning anyone entering that section. This way, everyone can get the books they desire, and libraries won't have to worry about offending people.  In conclusion, libraries should refrain from censorship. Some libraries' attempts to censor by removing so - called offensive books are misguided. We need to find a better way to manage the book collection to ensure everyone's access and respect for different interests.
1396	4373	2	3	Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It might be due to the way they were brought up, or simply what they believe. I do not believe that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal opinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world. If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others against their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive. I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part. I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they should be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind. In conclusion, censorship should be a personal and parental choice rather than a universal one.
1397	4374	2	3	At Jeffersonville High School, we don't have the right to remove a book from the shelf. If there's a book that isn't suitable for you, don't pick it up, just like you wouldn't watch a bad movie. It's like getting a bad lunch; you're not going to choose it, so why choose a bad book or movie? We should respect the diversity of materials available and let individuals make their own choices. In conclusion, the school should maintain a diverse collection and let students decide what they want to engage with.
1398	4375	2	3	Censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book, song, movie, or magazine is found offensive in any way. Mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools. Censorship was originally started during the 'Dark Ages' in Europe with the Catholic Church. It was used to hide information from the public by taking all records of it away from the public's use. In the United States, we are a democracy, but we still choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people. In some parents' opinions, books are great and educational for children, but in other parents' opinions, books do things like promote homosexuality, use false language, or even show drug use. Most of these books are not trying to promote these things but they are just part of the story. So, pretend like we hide all the bad events or situations in the world from occurring in front of our children. They have no knowledge of this part of life, so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up? We can't just hide drugs from them; we can read these books and teach them the harm drugs can do to someone and how to avoid them. If we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs, things will get out of control. The majority of these books that contain 'harmful' things to children actually teach lessons that parents don't think of. They just think of what's written down on the paper instead of the moral overall lesson that the story is bringing to a child. If a story has false language, our child will ask us what these words mean and we will tell them not to use them and what they mean so the child knows not to repeat them. If not, they can go into school and another child will tell your child to say these words and your child (not knowing the meaning of the word) will go out and say it and be awarded with a detention or even a suspension. Personally, I don't want my child receiving a detention or suspension. Censorship is a growing issue in the United States. It can do good things like hide actual sexual interactions from children, which should be hidden from children anyways. Censorship can also do the bad things like I discussed earlier, which do more harm to a child than good. When you're asked for your opinion on censorship, just always remember what's best for your child, and knowledge is always better than cluelessness. In conclusion, while censorship has its place in protecting children from certain content, it should not be over - used to the point of depriving children of valuable life lessons.
1399	4376	2	3	Going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things. Some items are not appropriate for everyone though. Certain books, movies, magazines, and music should not be accessed by everyone. Having an adult - only section would be a way to solve this problem. Removing certain materials from the library would not be in good interest. Any popular material should be available at the library. Many best - selling books would be wrong for children to read, but they would be perfectly fine for adults. That doesn't mean these books need to be taken out of the library. Children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though. Having a section in the library from which only adults can rent the items would remove this problem. People under 18 should also be restrained from looking through these materials. Having a children's section in the library would also keep them away from adult materials. The library needs to make itself user - friendly. People who frequent the library often pick up a book, not knowing what it holds. When inappropriate material is inside, a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to. Parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text. They should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library. Library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults. Allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library. Taking adult materials out of the library is not a good idea. It would lower its popularity. Everyone has different interests, and they want to research them at the library. The safety of children is also important. Making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern. Having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem. Not allowing anyone under 18 to check out explicit materials would also help. Keeping the library full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation. In conclusion, creating distinct adult and children sections in the library is a practical solution to balance the diverse needs of all library users.
1400	4377	2	3	I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should. For example, there are many good books that are banned because they might have a little bit of cussing in them, but I believe that is okay. I mean, it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words, maybe even worse, if he turned on his TV. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someone's religion. For example, I read a very famous book called The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my school library so I couldn't check it out. I had to go to the public library to get it. I don't understand what is so wrong with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn that it is banned by some educational institutions. This book might talk of a mischievous youngster who runs away, does a lot of different crazy activities, and even smokes, but this is no worse than what we are exposed to on TV. If I was an administrator in a school, I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express. For example, if a book is offensive to someone, for instance a book written by a white supremacist, this piece shouldn't be allowed on the shelf. But if it is a book about the Civil War and the Confederacy's view on slavery, this would be okay. Because the white supremacist book is more hate than anything; it is, for instance, promoting racism and that isn't right. But the book on the Civil War and the Confederacy's view on slavery is a part of our history. It shows different ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong; it is just what they believed. So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that don't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it might not be what you agree with, but judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express. Hopefully, you will agree with me in this. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someone's religion. I have expressed my opinion on this matter. I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the school that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves. In conclusion, book - banning decisions should be based on the underlying message and moral value of the book rather than surface - level content.
1401	4378	2	3	Whenever you go these days, you see violence in every store around the world. Children growing up in this world are our future, and they witness that negative output. A lot of kids and young adults thrive on the offensive materials the world presents. I think that offensive items should be taken off the regular shelves and sold in stores only for adults who are twenty - one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores where young teenagers can buy those products, then we are just putting ourselves at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and saw magazines that were not appropriate. I thought to myself how they could sell these types of magazines. Music, movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store; that's why it's called a book store. It's not called a movie, music, or magazine store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive, they are going to grow up thinking it's okay to be that way or treat somebody differently because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store, just take the offensive ones and have a twenty - one or older sign. So the kids don't end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't. When I was young, I went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. A lot of the time, my mom would take the book from me because it was offensive. I didn't know that at the time; I was just a little kid. In today's society, kids are growing up quicker than they really have to, and that's not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kids' books. I guess it doesn't really matter for middle school and high school kids because those kids really don't like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for are the ones in elementary because those kids actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelf, those kids will read it, learn about it, and be curious about what that drug has an effect on them. In the end, it doesn't really matter what I say because people are going to keep making books. Any type of book is all based on how much money they can make. It doesn't matter if it is a negative or a positive book; the company wants to make money, and so does the author. We need to find a balance to protect our children from harmful content while still allowing the free flow of ideas.
1402	4379	2	3	There are many different topics that could be offensive; it just depends on the person's own personal judgement. In my opinion, I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinions. If someone comes from a different country or even a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way. When I am older and if one of my elementary - aged children was to bring home a book about abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inappropriate topics for younger children be in the books they read. It is a little bit different with a high - school student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material, and I do not think it is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone. In the book, 'A Child Called It', there are a lot of detailed events that happen. Some might say it is too graphic for children, but the reality is, events like those happen in today's society. It really opened up my eyes, and I am extremely happy I read it. The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe it had the same effect on other people too, and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation. Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and say it is alright, but books that will help expand the children's minds. It could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitive topic, but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? It would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs rather than having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in. I have also read a book recently titled, 'Unwind', which is about the government granting the ability to unwind your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. It is sort of cruel in one way, but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. It states that everywhere you go, people are going to disagree and agree on things, but not everyone will believe in the same thing. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes to different views. Racism, abortion, child abuse, unwinding your children, whatever the case may be, some people will support it and some will not. I think it is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truly believe in, and taking 'offensive' material from school libraries is not going to help any. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about it, the author had to have had a reason to write it, and honestly, what is better for the future than a generation of children grounded in their own true beliefs?
1403	4380	2	3	Since the beginning, there has always been someone who is offended by certain media. Books, movies, and music have been the main focus of this controversy. There have been arguments over it so severe that it has gone to court! The people who have been upset over media have caused there to be certain censorships over these materials. I believe that there should not be censorship in media. I think that there are books, movies, and other media materials that can be found offensive to someone or a group of people. This is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it. If something is considered too vulgar for the public eye, then they should have it in a more discrete area, but not be taken off the shelves. I disagree that media materials should be taken off shelves for being offensive. Media is all about someone's free expression and trying to share it with the world. There are around 7 billion people in the world, and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do. A great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the Bible. The Bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print. People of different religions can sometimes find the print of Bibles alongside their religious books offensive, and there is always great controversy about it. All these movies and books are great because they are different and free! The world needs people who challenge ideas and religions. Every single person in the world is unique, and I think it is great for everyone to put their opinions out for others to find so they can have a new view on the subject or at least contemplate it. Society has already put parental advisory warnings on CDs, put ratings on movies, and labeled books as challenged. All this does is restrict the public from finding new ideas to compare to and form opinions. I believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have; it is what sets us apart from each other. Let media be free so men, women, and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful! Censorship will be challenged in years to come, and I will help challenge it for all to be free and happy, as a free - thinking society is a progressive one.
1404	4381	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines that are in libraries should be appropriate material. But in some cases, it's fine to have some offensive literature because people can learn from it. However, there needs to be an age limit to checking out these items. So I do believe we should keep offensive literature on the shelves, but with a certain extent. There are so many books and other kinds of literature in libraries today. Libraries are a place of silence, and to some people, that's boring. So, like me, when I go into a library, I go to the books or magazines that seem very interesting to me. Although they may seem interesting to me, others may find them offensive. For example, it might be a comic book that says something that someone may take offense to. Libraries can't please everyone that walks through the doors. Just because someone does not like the offensive stuff that's in there doesn't mean they have to take it out. Because there might be someone like me who likes those kinds of books or magazines. There is offensive stuff all over the world, so you can't avoid it everywhere you go. I believe there is a good outcome for keeping offensive literature material on the shelves. I think that keeping offensive material in libraries may have a good cause for one very good reason: learning. As I said before, it may be offensive to some people, but to some, it's not. So some people might like to learn about offensive things. Maybe they never knew those things that are in those books. They also may never know what's in those books unless they keep them on the shelves. They need to have a section where offensive books, magazines, music, and movies go. If something is offensive, put it on the shelf, and they must be 18 years old to check it out if it's on that shelf. Yeah, there may be a down - fall to keeping offensive things in libraries. But you can't hide from it all your life. So instead of going out into the world and learning about it the hard way, go to the library. You could pick a book up, learn about it, and learn how to deal with it. It's just part of life; there is offensive material everywhere. You can't be sheltered your whole life. So, in my opinion, I do believe that we should keep these offensive materials in libraries; it could be a learning experience that enriches our understanding of the world.
1405	4382	2	3	I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books. However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries. Removing or censoring them would be like washing away some bad things, but it would also be a bad idea. By keeping these books in libraries, we allow for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives. While offensive content can be a concern for young children, libraries can implement measures such as age - restricted sections or clear labeling. This way, older and more mature readers can access these materials to gain different insights and knowledge. Censoring books limits the freedom of thought and the ability to explore various viewpoints. We should trust that libraries can manage the presence of offensive books in a way that balances the need for knowledge and the protection of young minds. In conclusion, we should find a middle - ground approach that preserves the integrity of libraries as a source of diverse information while safeguarding the well - being of young readers.
1406	4383	2	3	I think that the censorship in libraries should definitely be relevant. For instance, if someone wants to check out an adult book, they should be required to show ID at the front desk. Many children take advantage of the current system; they rent books and games they know their parents would never allow. A censorship system should be a quite simple arrangement for public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose since they are not under any state law. On the other hand, public libraries are under state and city law, so they should not be able to expose adult content to children. For example, in many libraries around the U.S., there are books called manga or anime books. A lot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated 13+. I think there could be many changes in the library systems. It is your choice if you want to change them or not, but implementing proper censorship would better protect young patrons.
1407	4384	2	3	I do not believe that materials in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay closer attention to what their children are doing. By closely monitoring their children, parents will be able to control what their kids are exposed to. There are a lot of inappropriate things for children to read, look at, and listen to out there. Parents need to do a better job of teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen to. It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are actively looking for it. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library, the more adult - oriented books and magazines are separated from the children's books. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times I have been to a library, I have never accidentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages and it should not be limited to just one age group. If libraries were censored, more people would be upset. It would be similar to a store stopping the sale of your favorite product because one person did not like it. A lot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. Then, the library would become a place mainly for children. Most small children do not even go to the library, so it would become virtually useless. In all of my years, I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Whether it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouth, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitoring what their children look at or read. Those parents should not be deprived of their privileges to look at more adult - rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was irresponsible to monitor their child does not mean that all parents should be punished. The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefore, the library should keep materials for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottom line is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things, they should keep a better watch over them and teach them the difference between what is acceptable and what is not.
1408	4385	2	3	Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them and finds them offensive is simply not fair. A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy. A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think. Simply regulating books and other products by creating age limits based on the books' content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves. Take an author like Mark Twain for example. His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people. That being said, censoring the books' language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like Mark Twain's, then they would have no problem making inferences on what material was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized. The other fact is that taking out mature - level books completely from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product, you're going to lose the diversity in your customers as well. For instance, think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were G and PG, there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because you're taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie. So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books? Books that deal with more controversial content shouldn't be placed on the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book may contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you can't shield them from reality forever. We're all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality, so a balanced approach is needed.
1409	4386	2	3	I believe that if you let people take stuff off of the shelves that they didn't like, then there would be nothing left. I think this because there are a lot of parents who don't want their little kids to be seeing or hearing inappropriate things. That is because their kids could get influenced to do the wrong thing and get themselves in trouble. Then you have some parents who don't care what their kids are doing as long as they are leaving them alone. And then you have some other parents who are very over - protective. Yes, I think that there are some things that should be taken off shelves because they are very inappropriate. They are inappropriate because they talk about drugs and alcohol and try to get young kids to try them and get addicted. That way, those businesses can get more money, but those kids end up getting hurt or even dying from it. All some of these businesses are trying to do is get money from the young by making the bottles or containers look cool. Most of the time, you will have kids go for it, but there are some kids who don't because they don't want to get in trouble or hurt themselves. There are some songs that should not be allowed to be played because of some of the things they say. There are some people and some parents who listen to it with their kids in the car, and then their kid will go to school and be singing it and get in trouble. I think that there are a lot of things that should be different, but they are not because the businesses are just happy that they are getting money. They don't care who is buying it as long as they get their money, and that is not the right way to look at it. You should care about the lives of people and their families. Then you have some magazines that have some inappropriate pictures in them. They do this because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one picture that is in it. They want it because it's a very pretty girl with just a bathing suit on or maybe nothing on. That is why they put it in there to get their money. Most of the girls in them are models and they are very pretty, but sometimes there will be a little boy who takes his dad's magazine and then takes it to school and gets in trouble. Then his parents are embarrassed because they didn't know he had it. That is why I think that some stuff should not be on the shelves in stores. You will have parents who buy it and then leave it lying out, and their kids will get into it and might take it to school. You should never leave anything that you don't want your kids to have lying out for them to get. That is why I believe what I think about this issue, and proper regulation of these items on store shelves is necessary.
1410	4387	2	3	Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offensive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I believe they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies, and they all have different preferences. Companies that manufacture books, movies, music, and magazines would be losing out on money if people can't find something they like. If they don't have the money to produce what they make, then they will go out of business. Then you might be out of luck for finding what you are looking for. All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shelves because one person did not like it? Well, that's how people feel when offensive - labeled items are removed. What would be put in their places? Stores have to have something to fill the shelves. Would they put more candy and make the world fatter? If you come across something you think is offensive, just don't pay attention to it. Others may like it, just as you like your favorite candy. We have a great number of other things you can pick from. In conclusion, removing offensive items from shelves would have negative impacts on both consumers and businesses, so it's better to let the market and individual choice prevail.
1411	4388	2	3	A curious young child, full of wonder and excitement, goes into the library for the first time with the eager hope to find an interesting story to read. Yet, when she eagerly makes her way to the children's section, the particular book she wants so badly is not allowed in this library because it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child, feeling a bit disappointed, then goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. However, the older sister is too busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her in - depth questions over a liberal topic. Unfortunately, she can't find the book she wants as the library has censored it. Why would we censor libraries if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is definitely not right to censor libraries because that is restricting what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper; it is relaying a story to entertain the audience that is reading it. By censoring libraries, that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a beautiful way to express yourself. Authors share their expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrible day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life. The '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something engaging to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind freely. I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me. Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture, the slightest thing can be called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things, how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items, we will never learn, and neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas. Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red - flagged. If certain items become restricted, it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this, a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red - flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose themselves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work because the books could stay in the library and still be used, but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it. In conclusion, censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech. We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system, it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' material can stay in the libraries, but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are too.
1412	4389	2	3	I think that no source of knowledge should be taken off any shelf in any library because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion, someone could find a book offensive, and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me, so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shelves are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive. Some books are racist. Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, for example, has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that, then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when I'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone too, and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's. Also, some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse than the books people read. If you find a book offensive, don't read it! When I hear about a book being offensive, it makes me want to read it. It gives the book character and makes it humorous. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from those books, you even learn something about yourself that makes you wonder if I didn't read this book, would I still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people, and that's the best part about reading a book like that. Libraries are a wonderful place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading, and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that I had growing up, plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me, it's just not right to take away someone else's choice of knowledge. That's my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries.
1413	4390	2	3	I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelves because a few people are offended. There @MONTH1 be a few that don't like something, but for every few that don't like it, there are some who do. For example, there might be a book that makes females look dumb, but personally, it doesn't affect me, but there are some girls who get offended because of their superior knowledge. I have a friend who gets offended by movies where the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first. So if we removed every movie that offended him, what would be left? I feel offended when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves. Even though I feel offended, I'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give useful tips and actually help people feel better about themselves. If I took that away from them, it could cause issues. If there is something that is removed from shelves, it should have a good reason. Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity, I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it. Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue. Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster, and everyone swarms the stand, attacking each other. Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized, and then the library will be sued. Yes, I agree that there are some people who would request the stuff to be removed, but you can't always get your way. I know people would say that's not fair, but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair,' and that's true. So next time you hear someone wanting something removed, tell them this, or next time you want something removed, you refer back to this. So in conclusion, things shouldn't be removed unless necessary. So when someone is offended, that's their problem. You can always walk away; you don't have to look or listen.
1414	4391	2	3	I believe that the certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., they are here for a reason. People like them. Maybe there are some books and things that people @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not find offensive. That's okay. I'm not trying to say it isn't, but you don't have to look at that book. There are so many others to pick from; it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up. The objects we are talking about are our entertainment; it brings us joy and many smiles. People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers but through these tools. Tools is a better word for these things as it makes them have a real meaning. Children nowadays love books, music, movies, magazines, etc. As a teenager, I can say that most of us who like music love it deeply. It builds our character. People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust. They were meant to be picked up and looked at. I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this. Don't get me wrong; I can understand where their opinion stands, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Children, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another. Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well. If people want this, it is going to be a big war. Only because they are not the only people on the planet. If people want these tools of ours to be removed, this will only be the beginning. In the next couple of years from now, people will want to get rid of something else, then something else. It's just one right after another; it won't stop. This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion; some are good, and some are bad. In this case, my opinion is that I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can improve our world as we know it.
1415	4392	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. @CAPS1, you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3, you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books. @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life, and personally, I think you should live yours as well. Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on. Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away. Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example, look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work. I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that consisted of drugs and violence that I related to, and @CAPS4 helped me out. @CAPS4 made me realize it's not always the right thing to do. I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the above that 'offend' them are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parents, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in their lives. Violence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check. Books like that can influence kids to want to go the right direction. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison, and they'll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the gist of what I'm trying to say. If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive are enjoyable to me. This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survive. What do you think is in store for the next years to come? You must learn to deal with @CAPS4. Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions; they don't have to pick up an @PERSON1 book when there is an @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honestly think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie knew what it was about, and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get 'offended.' @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure
1416	4393	2	3	In this world, you truly never know what someone might be writing. There're numerous materials in this world that I firmly think aren't appropriate for someone to be reading, watching, or listening to, etc. You might be thinking that anyone makes his/her own decision of what they read, watch, or listen. Well, I do whole - heartedly agree with that, but I do sincerely believe that some materials aren't rated properly according to age. I do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone. You might be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, etc., but in my honest opinion, some materials are just offensive and not proper. I've seen so many materials that I think are not proper for people under age to be looking at. In some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or inappropriate language. You might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but I do. In my opinion, some materials are not rated low enough and should not be for people under age. It's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and acting like rebels towards their parents. Many of these things kids pick up from books, music, movies, etc. This is one of the many reasons some materials should be banned from kids. You might ask yourself why? Well, first of all, kids are just learning and they tend to do everything they watch, see, or listen to. I mean now kids don't even think about what they're about to do. They just act, they don't care, they think it's okay. I think that parents should be alert to offensive materials on the shelves and should say something about it so that they can be banned. Why ban some materials from everyone? Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right? You might be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and there's nothing wrong with it. Well, you might be right but also wrong. I certainly do agree with you, we all watch things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us. Why do people do crazy things these days? In my opinion, I think it's because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, etc. I think that if a book shows very offensive things, they should be banned from everyone no matter what. It's the right thing to do. If you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is, well, we need to do something about all these offensive materials and ban them for good. We certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or acting like rebels towards us. We don't want some crazy person coming to our house and doing crazy things to us just because that's what they learned from those materials on the shelves. It's clear to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone.
1417	4394	2	3	A place filled with knowledge should be a place where you can find all the news that is shaping the world as it is today. A person should also be able to find out things from the past. A library has many different things in it: books, magazines, movies, and some even have music. The books range from encyclopedias to works by @PERSON1. The variety of books and information is truly extensive. But then again, with all the good things, there always comes a bad side to the information. With all the profanity found in today's society, you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library. Books are placed in a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgeable. The thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting, but then again, who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature types of information or language in them. I feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read. The fact of the matter is they have the right to. Both young and older people need to be educated about the world's past history and the present news. One reason is to prevent things that happened in the past from happening again. Another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is well - informed. Libraries should have banners or flaps up clearly stating what is in a certain section of that specific area, and people can then make the decision to go to those areas or not. Things that are considered 'not right' in one person's eyes might not seem so bad to another; it's all a matter of personal preference. Things should still be available for the public to read or see. Making the choice to go into a library is an individual's decision. The fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to gain knowledge, no matter what type of information. A person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others.
1418	4395	2	3	I think that your parents should have to sign a piece of paper clearly stating that it is okay or it's not okay for the person to go to that side of the library. It is ultimately up to the parents and how their kids will handle it. On one side of the library, it would be more geared towards a more mature audience. Of course, there would be no pornographic material, but there would be stuff that wouldn't be considered suitable for younger readers. Kids fifteen and older would generally understand. They might also have to have an adult accompany them. On the other side of the library, it would be more of a children's area filled with children's stories. It would be targeted towards kids who are fourteen years and younger. There would have to be someone at the dividing line checking the pass that indicates whether it is okay or not. It would be a little difficult to implement, but it would satisfy both parties. It is up to the parent to decide if it is okay for their children to read a certain content of language and description. However, the child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent. I definitely agree with Katherine Paterson. Eventually, your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me about it than find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law. Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might endanger their lives. By having such a system in the library, we can ensure that children are exposed to appropriate materials while still allowing them to gradually learn about the world in a safe way.
1419	4396	2	3	Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are truly unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle? Everyone in this world is entitled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people might be right to others. For example, one family might view their children using curse words as offensive while another might see no problem. The diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence discussed in published works. These concepts exist in the world, and censoring them will not make them disappear. It is well - understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that fundamental fact. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability to see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspectives does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the acknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored. In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of personal opinion, and we should respect the diversity of views in our society.
1420	4397	2	3	Do I think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves? No, I do not think that some of these materials should be removed. Why? Because nowadays, kids read things such as gang violence and other materials that don't involve school - related content, but some kids find the books they read interesting. Now, do I think that the books should not be given to students who are very young? Yes, due to the fact that some books are a bit above the reading level and maturity of younger kids. Sometimes you might have kids who are interested in what others don't read. Books about gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories that some kids can't handle. I think that in this case, kids under a certain age shouldn't read these books because of the content involved. Kids find these books, movies, and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today are portrayed in those books. I'm not saying that it's a good thing, but I'm saying that the things they read and see in those books and movies are things that some of us have witnessed in our everyday lives. When I was younger, I went to a library in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, and whenever a kid would choose a book that wasn't appropriate for him/her, they would always say 'you need your parents' permission to check this book or magazine, etc. out'. Once I actually noticed and understood the reason for this, I thought that it was a good idea. I figure that all libraries should be like this, considering that kids shouldn't read books that aren't suitable for them. This is also a good way to guide kids from reading things that are not age - appropriate to finding something that is. So the main answer to this suggestion is, no, I don't think that these materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries. Why? Because once they are gone, then some kids might not even visit the library anymore because the books they find interesting are no longer there. So my suggestion is to keep them on the shelves, just like any other book, and let parents and librarians play their roles in guiding kids' reading choices.
1421	4398	2	3	Do you believe that certain books, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship? There are numerous instances when you hear a parent caution their child not to look at that magazine because they don't want them to encounter the vulgar content inside. I've often heard parents tell their children not to ever watch that movie as it'll display things that they don't need to be exposed to. Almost daily, we find ourselves in such situations, uncertain whether we should pick up the magazine or simply leave it on the shelf. In my opinion, I firmly believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves. Kids are strongly encouraged to visit the library as frequently as possible, but not if there are vulgar items on the shelves.   Kids are advised many times a week by their parents, teachers, and other adults to go to the library. They can work on their homework, read an interesting book, or do some focused studying for school. When they get distracted from finding the book they want by a book that contains vulgar things, they're bound to be curious. The main reason I oppose having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children. The last thing they need to be looking at is something that isn't suitable for their age. It's extremely difficult for a child to resist a movie or magazine they've never seen or looked at before.   In most libraries, the adult section is separated from the children's section. However, this doesn't mean that a child can't overhear something that the adults are listening to or watching. The children's section is designed for fairytale stories and kid - friendly movies, but when the adult section has inappropriate activities going on, kids can overhear. If children and adults are going to be in the same library, then I think they should make it completely inaccessible for children to wander over there and see what's new on that side of the library.   Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of teenagers in the community. After school hours, a large number of teenagers in our community enjoy going to the library. If this is such a great environment for teenagers to be in, then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet?   Some teenagers listen to bad music with cursing, vulgar language, and much more. Libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this. If they want to download bad music, then they need to do it somewhere else where younger ones can't get a hold of any of it.   My last argument for this is a reminder for the parents. Parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library. You might not think your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes, they're curious. All children are, and it's human nature to be curious. I, myself, would accompany my child a few times just to see what's in the library and tell them not to take things off the shelves that look bad.   Some libraries can't completely fix everything. They can't take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves. In the quote it says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I can think of books and magazines that I would never want any child to look at, especially at a young age. Libraries need to be more vigilant in taking vulgar things off the shelves so that younger children cannot access them. It's one thing for a child to see a book or magazine that isn't necessarily appropriate, but in a library, it's a completely different matter. In conclusion, libraries should take proactive steps to manage vulgar content to protect the well - being of young visitors.
1422	4399	2	3	There are certain books that no child should ever read, but in some libraries, they seem indifferent about what's on their shelves. They don't seem to care if a little kid starts reading a book full of cusswords and other profanity. As long as he's reading, that's all that matters to them. Even though libraries have kid sections, that doesn't mean he can't walk over and grab an inappropriate book or whatever he can get his hands on.   When I was little, I was always in the library, and it was never difficult to get a book with bad language. We even thought it was funny whenever the book had cursewords in it because we would just repeat them. I remember in school, even books the teacher would read to us had cursewords, and we would all laugh at it. Even the teacher thought it was funny. But if we ever repeated that word while not reading it, we would get sent down to the office. Even though we thought it was okay to say just because we read it out of a book.   I do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf where a kid can grab it. I think it's fine to have cursewords in books when students are in junior high, but elementary school is too early. Those books are meant for adults only because some books sound better with cursewords in them. My parents thought it was wrong when I would bring home a book from the library and it would be full of cursewords or slang. But they would never say anything to the library because they know that I will be hearing these words all the time when I get older.   In conclusion, considering the impressionable nature of elementary - school children, books with curse words should not be easily accessible to them. While it may be inevitable for kids to encounter such language as they grow older, libraries should take steps to ensure that young children are protected from inappropriate content.
1423	4400	2	3	Billions of books are constantly moving from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and non - fictional, horror and comedy. Writers, residing in every corner of the world, compose works that range from complex life experiences to simple dreams. As an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots can have endless combinations. Every reader has a different preferred style.   Libraries are filled with books that reach up to the ceilings, encompassing any and every kind. Books are carefully divided into their individual sections according to truth, genre, and cover, with each category typically having about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers create for all sorts of people. For some to claim what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitimate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings similar to movies, a restricted cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. However, taking away the enjoyment for some readers is unethical.   Whether it pertains to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who create the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the concern is regarding youth, parental guidance should be in effect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source, so it's important to consider all options. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of expression of creators and rely on parental guidance rather than censorship to manage content for young audiences. To each, its own.
1424	4401	2	3	Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is interpreted very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be censored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have opaque covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialogue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public.   Growing up, my parents would carefully monitor what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that I looked at. When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big, scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty - foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler, @PERSON1 @CAPS1, who could frighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world championship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye - candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half - naked girls fighting each other and turns off the TV and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.   I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial, and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with the @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved the @CAPS7 show as well and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me.   I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.   In conclusion, while censorship can be a subjective matter, it often plays a role in protecting young people from inappropriate content. Parents and guardians, with their concerns for their children's well - being, often make decisions about what their kids can and cannot consume. As individuals grow older, they gain the ability to make their own choices, but the influence of parental censorship during childhood is undeniable.
1425	4402	2	3	Yes, there are many things today that have censorship, but should we keep them out of our libraries? I think not. They should not remove items from the libraries due to censorships. Maybe if they are such a big concern, they could do something else with them besides taking them out.   I don't believe that they should take out censorship items from the libraries just because some people have a problem with it. Because nowadays, you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies, games, etc. I think that if they are even thinking about taking censored products out of the library, it should be up to the library and not the government.   If censorship is such a big problem with people, they don't have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problems with parents because their kids are checking out the censored items, they should have a ban. Like if you want to check out an item with a censorship, you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardian with you. But if it is still having a problem with it, make it like tobacco products where you have to be @NUM1.   Then if the libraries don't want to do that, they could make a whole room just for censored items. They should also put the room in a corner or in a less - populated area of the library. There should also be a sign saying there are censored items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.   So there are many other ways of dealing with censored items. Since there are so many ways to deal with them, why take them out? We should not have to take censorship items out just because some people do not like it. Why punish everyone because of a few people? In conclusion, libraries should explore alternative ways to manage censored items rather than simply removing them, as it is unfair to limit access for all based on the preferences of a few.
1426	4403	2	3	What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantrum about how inappropriate a book was, and she vehemently wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stand there, stare blankly, and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I firmly believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off the shelves.   Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely necessary. However, when you really think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.   If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.   The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.   I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf. By doing so, we can maintain a diverse and inclusive library environment that caters to the needs of all.
1427	4404	2	3	Tuff @CAPS1 for a little @CAPS2   Censorship is a problem we are faced with today. I believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary, but I also feel it must be kept in check. That's why I have a great deal of respect for organizations and industries that try and stop or put off censorship of media until you're more mature and responsible enough to handle it.   The most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are books and music. A lot of books are very well-written and fabulous to read, but in history or racial, and more cultural books they use words/terms that are offensive to me and a lot of other people too.   Also, the main cause in this is music. In today's society, nearly every person has an iPod and downloaded onto that iPod is music. I'm not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases I hear about every word in the book and race topics. Rappers are setting bad examples for young adolescents like myself, who pose with guns and have marijuana and crack. Why do they do this? Just to make themselves more popular. That is hurting our education and making us think we should be criminals.   I, in my opinion, enjoy magazines and true informative facts from professional reporters. The reporters are on the citizens' side and trying to get the true facts out there for us, the people. Magazines also tell about annual celebrations and good things happening in the world. Where you can find out the scores of sports games and what the weather is going to be like.   Last year, I remember reading 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4'. It was so controversial and talked about black slaves and whites treating them like dirt. Also, about blacks never winning a trial and being treated unfairly. I felt embarrassed and I was the only African American in the class. It was awkward. I felt like if we had a discussion people would talk badly about it then remember I was in the room then they'd stop.   What is the world going to do? Censorship covers an entire multi-media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship. It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolescents in the world. To help fight this cause! Bring down all that is bad! We can do it, we will fight! Like @PERSON1 says, 'don't hope for a better change or wish for a new world.' If you want change you need to make it happen and stand up for what's right and make a difference in the world. By taking action and being vigilant, we can work towards a better and more responsible media environment.
1428	4405	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend anyone's gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offends anyone's religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offends anyone's race.   The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy, eroding their self - esteem. Second, the material can cause a large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others, leading to heated arguments. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text, potentially leaving a negative impact on their mental state.   Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song - writer, actor, and/or director, breeding unnecessary animosity. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents, not by offending someone's religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrorists from this offensive content, which is a serious threat to society.   The material also should be removed if it is offending someone's race. First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's a very offensive name (not directly but in general), causing immediate hurt. Second, the material can speak of the race as if it was bad, perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race, spreading prejudice.   The material that is offensive to anyone's gender, religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. The library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting, not to offend other people in all ways. By removing such offensive materials, we can create a more inclusive and respectful library environment.
1429	4406	2	3	Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is inappropriate for children, and we wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library.   To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child @MONTH1 not be aware. I believe there are certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five - year - old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older, which can have a negative impact on their development.   To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they saw on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken aback. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation, causing unrest in the library.   Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something.   To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what @MONTH1 cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x - rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a separate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it. By doing so, we can ensure that the library remains a place of learning and enjoyment for all.
1430	4407	2	3	What do you think about them taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive? Everyone has a different look on it. It is an important thing to think about. Just stop and think: do you want your child looking at that when you are not around? Many would say no, because they are too young to know about stuff that shows too much and for other reasons also. Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens and children.   I believe that they should be taken off the shelves, and you have to be @NUM1 or older to buy them for many reasons. The biggest reason I think they should is that kids under the age of @NUM1 want to look cool like the older teenagers, but really don't need to see that. With the young teenagers thinking they need to do things like the stuff in music, movies, to be cool and thinking if they do that they @MONTH1 look cool. Young teenagers don't think about what they are doing, and just think it's okay because the older ones are doing it and they see it. With magazines, and movies, and music they need to be of age to buy. One big reason to believe that they should be taken off the shelves is because a lot of kids and young teens think they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive. There are a lot of different types, and you have to be of age to go into some places. With believing that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the @CAPS1 a feeling of free about your child to look at things without thinking about the offensive ones.   I hope with reading my persuasive essay, I hope I relate to someone about the books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive can realize what I'm talking about with young teens around the ages of @NUM3 and if you take your child with you and they see something like that. With the stuff I gave you it helps you see the outlook on stuff that is offensive on the shelves. By taking offensive materials off the shelves and implementing age - restrictions, we can better protect the well - being and development of our young people.
1431	4408	2	3	Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My firm opinion on this matter is a resounding no. In this essay, I will clearly explain my stance and sincerely hope to change other people's viewpoints. I will also elaborate on how the past has a profound effect on the present day.  In some instances, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., might seem to offend any race or a certain sex, but that is a reflection of what occurred in the history of the @LOCATION1. Some of these materials might be very offensive, yet they only showcase a bygone era. Others might just be blatantly racist or sexist. Those that depict the @LOCATION1's history serve as an educational source so that we can learn from past mistakes.  Here is precisely why I hold this opinion. Taking this material off the shelves is akin to taking someone's freedom of speech away. I detest it when I hear music that disrespects women, but I'm not going to attempt to get it removed because it might simply be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how the history for their family might have been.  In conclusion, I firmly believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion, take a moment to consider what is truly offensive and what is just someone expressing a past memory. If a past event was offensive, something today might seem offensive as well. As I was taught earlier in my life, treat others as you want to be treated. I earnestly hope I have caught your attention and changed some opinions because a great deal of the offense today has stemmed from the past.
1432	4409	2	3	Censorship in libraries? A yes or a No? I firmly believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are very few things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in @LOCATION1. I truly can't fathom who would come up with such an absurd idea.  To me, there are simply far too many ways for people to get offended. For instance, I remind you that we almost changed our pledge to the flag of our country by removing the word 'god' all because some people don't believe in god. Now, we are supposed to get rid of good books just because they might not be deemed child - friendly by someone? Think about all the amazing books, movies, and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or 'I don't think this book is appropriate for my child.' What about the people who do like that book and now won't be able to read it anymore all because of that one person?  There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just place the 'naughty' books in the eighteen - year - old or older section so that younger kids don't see them. The people who want to get rid of so - called dangerous books to children make libraries sound like they are pornographic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible, bad books that will cause their child to be mentally scarred forever. In fact, there aren't really that many such books out there anyway.  Now, sometimes a 'bad' book might end up in the kids' section, but that doesn't mean we have to remove that book forever from all the other people who want to read it. All library workers just have to make sure to put all books in their rightful spots, and nothing bad will happen. The 'bad' books will be in the adult section, and the child - friendly books will be in another. Have some library workers monitor the area and ensure little kids don't enter the adult section. This will prevent children from seeing the 'bad' books because they will be in the appropriate adult section.  In conclusion, I answer this question by saying no. There are just far too many good books that would have to be gone forever, and it's not worth sacrificing the wealth of knowledge and entertainment they offer.
1433	4410	2	3	I believe that all literature of any kind is useful, even though it could be offensive. If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, then many life - lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to transport people to different worlds, to help them acquire knowledge, and to teach them lessons that the real world might not teach them. If materials are taken off the shelf out of fear of offending someone, then very few things will remain, just as Katherine Paterson says in her quote. If certain literature were no longer available, then it definitely would not be the same as it is now. Literature exists for us; it educates us, and if even one item was taken away, it would likely start a commotion.  Books are always there for us, whether we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality. Imagine if you were not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society. If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would strip all the excitement out of everything. Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be watered down to meet the needs of our 'non - offending' society. A lot of music would lose its charm, and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.' Movies would become too dull to watch, and many aspects of society would be negatively affected.  Books, documentaries, magazines are there to help people learn. For example, if it's a lesson about what not to do while young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke, then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking? Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come alive to readers. They have problems just like people in the real world, even though they might not be real themselves. So, if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real - life person decide on what they should do about their problem. Important history books or movies could be taken away because it 'offends' some people for students to learn about slaves.  If one item was taken from the shelf because of offending someone, then more and more materials would be taken away from society. What good does that do anyone? It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about. It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of appropriateness. If books were being judged on appropriateness, then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now. No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.  In conclusion, books, movies, magazines, music - it is all too important to society. It keeps us company, teaches us, and makes life easier at times when the world seems against us. If one person decides that a book is not appropriate, they can choose not to read it, but they should not decide to remove that book from the library shelves. Doing so would start a chain reaction of trouble that would affect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe. Information of any kind is valuable, no matter its content. So, removing any sort of material from our libraries is a truly horrible idea.
1434	4411	2	3	The content in today's materials is not always suitable for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be exposed to, including video games. By growing up in a violent environment, children observe and are more likely to become violent themselves. The continuation of censorship in today's materials is a necessity for the well - being of the children in today's society.  In video games, there are ratings that help clarify what is suitable for each age throughout childhood and adolescence. Movies follow a similar system, making it more difficult for younger children to watch certain movies. However, books and magazines are not as well - protected as they should be. Age and maturity play a crucial role in determining whether a child should be allowed to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a prevalent trend in video games in today's world, and some of the influence it has on children is unnecessary and ultimately detrimental to their well - being.  The reason ratings should be improved is that children absorb their environment and tend to imitate what they see. So, if they are exposed to violent behavior, they have a higher chance of becoming violent children. In libraries, there are sections for every age group, specific genres of books, both fiction and non - fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are placed on the shelves and made available to young teenagers and children. As an important part of the community, libraries should contribute to the well - being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.  Throughout my own experiences, I have witnessed children growing up too quickly when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in today's music, radios do a decent job of editing content in songs by putting parental advisories on certain CDs, but this still doesn't prevent children from purchasing the material. In games such as @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc., teens are now getting used to this type of behavior, which is neither safe nor beneficial for children.  By censoring certain material, it helps prevent the spread of bad behavior among our youth today. This way, we can create a more positive and healthy environment for children to grow up in, where they are shielded from inappropriate content until they are mature enough to handle it.
1435	4412	2	3	READ WITH @CAPS1  I firmly do not believe that libraries carry the responsibility to censor reading materials. When a person steps into a library, they should immediately understand that, since libraries are places where knowledge is amassed, some of the information they find might not align with their beliefs. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can simply put it down just as easily as they picked it up.  Obviously, though, there are certain exceptions. Children's sections, of course, should be restricted to materials intended for younger readers. Placing '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' in a children's section hardly makes any sense, just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' in the adults' section.  In addition, author @PERSON1 once astutely stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be extended to all other patrons as well. This would ultimately lead to all the books in a library being off - limits, and the knowledge contained within them would remain unknown.  There are, as with any rule, exceptions. For example, if a library is designed solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should not be seen as a negative thing. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as pornographic reading material, protects children from forming ideas about concepts they might not be able to fully comprehend.  With all these factors considered, banning books from a library hardly seems like the best approach. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented, allowing readers to form their own opinions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types interact, a burst of intellectual energy is released, leading to growth and understanding. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their role as a haven of free knowledge, with minimal and well - considered censorship only in appropriate cases.
1436	4413	2	3	A library is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent. As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult - type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the library to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad. A few years back, I heard about a teenage boy that would go into the library about once a week to look for movies that his parents would not approve of. Later on, that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not have had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything you see and hear has some type of inappropriate background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry - free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the library. This problem can be easily fixed by removing that issue. I strongly believe that library material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, cannot see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. From what I have seen, someone might want, for example, a book about a particular religion taken off the shelf because they are of a different faith and might not support its religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion. Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the library for hours and soak in a good novel. Material that is found offensive does not belong there, unless it is for real educational learning. In conclusion, maintaining a proper balance in library content through appropriate censorship is crucial for creating a safe and educational environment for all visitors.
1437	4414	2	3	The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought up many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of its rating or the content in it is inappropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I. I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adult - related content. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age. These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times. When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called 'The Mysterious Adventure' by John Smith. This book was a fictional story taking place during the American Revolution. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out. That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it. From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over 18, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it may be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc. In conclusion, while censorship has its place in some media, censoring higher - level books for children is not the best approach. The parent - consent system can strike a balance between protecting children and allowing them to learn and grow through challenging reading materials.
1438	4415	2	3	Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people. There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves. I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves. One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project. For example, a student could have a project over a controversial historical event. A book on that controversial historical event could offend many people. Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book. Someone might need a certain book for a project. If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class. That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves. Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves is it's their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it. Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people? There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it. If a book offends you just don't look at it. Why would you look at something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries would have to remove a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it. That is my last reason my opinion is what it is. So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in taking books off the shelves. People need them for research and projects. It is someone's opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them. For example, if I didn't like something on a menu at a restaurant they are not going to take it off the menu for me. My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them that would be easier than taking books off the shelves. In conclusion, removing books from library shelves due to personal offense is an unjustifiable action. Keeping the books available serves the greater good of education and individual choice.
1439	4416	2	3	Is censorship Right? Is censorship right to have in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people might want all censored items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that might like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic. In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are public areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe censorship is unjustifiable to take away in libraries because this might be one's favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while no one else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are too revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American fashion is not going to ban capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions. A great resolution for this disagreement is categorizing. By putting all of the censored books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, censorship will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Whereas the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around it. This is a quick and easy fix. There is no reason to take away one's favorite genre because someone doesn't like it. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue Aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend Lily likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is non - beneficial for either of us because now the one we do not like is gone but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. People in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make it fit the community's likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Categorizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediately. In conclusion, categorizing library materials is a practical and fair solution to the issue of censorship, allowing everyone to enjoy the library according to their preferences.
1440	4417	2	3	In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many parents are opposed to. While libraries may seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrays it to be. One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age - appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the parents to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' Parents should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library. A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a separate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an R - rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of M, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. Similar censorship should be applied to libraries. Having separate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a separate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. This type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of this would be for a sixteen - year - old boy. While he cannot go and rent the R - rated movie, if his parents deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. This gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. The same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library. Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' This is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become this way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all too well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen - year - old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk - driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. This ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it
1441	4418	2	3	Library books offensive? The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us, ordinary people, based on our personal opinions. If someone has an issue with a particular book; next time, simply don't borrow it. I firmly believe that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the libraries. It's not within our purview to make that choice. I know people sometimes find certain things wrong or inappropriate in a book at the libraries, but if it doesn't suit your taste, don't read the rest of it or don't recommend it to a friend. I have had problems with this before. I went to check out a book, and my mom said that she didn't like the topic it was about: honestly, it's just her opinion. A person should have the right to his/her opinions, but it shouldn't affect someone else's access. One person in @MONTH1 really likes the book, while someone else in @MONTH1 hates it. Obviously, there are people out there who enjoy that type of book, so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it. The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian. That person knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library. If a book includes something graphic or racist, you can have a calm conversation with them because, although they're a librarian, they don't read every single book that is in the library. Some items can be offensive to some but not to others. The library is there for knowledge and entertainment. We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big fuss because there could be reasons why things are where they are. You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter and who is in charge of the library. In conclusion, respecting the librarian's judgment ensures the library remains a place that serves a diverse range of interests and promotes free access to information.
1442	4419	2	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary but also unconstitutional. As @CAPS1 citizens, we have certain @ORGANIZATION1 rights that we are guaranteed by the documents that keep our society from descending into anarchy. If the right to pick what literature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that leave our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today. In the @CAPS2, the @CAPS3, and the @ORGANIZATION1, we are given certain fundamental @ORGANIZATION1 rights. Some of these rights, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been restricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We @MONTH1 not have 'lost' these rights completely, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is truly frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people,' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat? Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples of why censorship of written literature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writing a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government deems rape as 'too graphic,' what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully - informed paper. But by censoring our libraries and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of its country's youth. Some @CAPS4 classics are also being wrongly speculated against. The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2 has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for educational purposes. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n - word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time - period of its writing, this word was more common and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern - day societies. But because time has changed its meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an @CAPS4 classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language.' Censorship is not only taking place in written literature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self - censor their children. But it is not up to the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parent's right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers. Music is one of the biggest parts of our society today. With the invention of iPods and @NUM1 devices, music has become much more common and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differ from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it @MONTH1 seem offensive to some citizens, but others @MONTH1 just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you @MONTH1 not listen to that'? This should not be allowed, yet it is. How can one person or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the @ORGANIZATION1 rights of our great country's citizens and the individual rights of people like yourself. In conclusion, we must stand up against censorship to preserve our constitutional rights and ensure a free and informed society.
1443	4420	2	3	It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that @MONTH1 seem harmful to children, freedom of information is far more important than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from gaining an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 clearly states that freedom of speech, religion, and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 grants the fundamental freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional as it blatantly prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all the information that should be available to them if not for censorship. Although private businesses and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that allow this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor. Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban particular books because of their personal views of alleged 'immorality.' Without clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, one cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Undoubtedly, this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knowledge left. Without knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark. Many books are banned that address great problems of society. @PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman @CAPS8 @PERSON4 burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend their special interest, that is, censorship. They feel powerful when they restrict other people's freedoms. A novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS9 @CAPS10, was banned. Apart from vulgar language in the book, @CAPS9 @CAPS10 also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of @LOCATION1 in @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS15. This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned. How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned? Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal, and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatantly unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and it hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our intelligence and liberty. In conclusion, we must oppose censorship to safeguard our right to free information and foster a more enlightened and progressive society.
1444	4421	2	3	Children are our future because when I am old, they will be the ones who are caring for me. So, for me, censorship is a big deal. It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children but also because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an important issue, but to what extent should it be taken? People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries. My view on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the bookshelf. I can understand censorship to a certain extent, but taking books out of a public library makes it difficult to decide where to draw the line. Just because a book has a bad word in it, does that mean we should take it out? Also, just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't keep that book in a public library? I do believe that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids' books; they most likely want to be reading a more complex book. I think there are some books that should stay out of the library, though. An example is books that are extremely racist. These books should be kept far away from our children. This is necessary because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read, especially since there are audio books, which would just make them say those things. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet. There are things that you can do as an alternative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one method that is used in public libraries, which is separating the adult books from the children's books. You could also move these two sections to opposite sides of the library. The books that are more explicit could be put higher up, such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as an adult. These are my views and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and views that I have are most likely different from most people. I thought they were good ideas, though. Ones such as having separate sections for kids and adults. I thought my best idea was putting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther apart. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library censorship, like these suggestions, can protect children while still allowing adults access to a wide range of reading materials.
1445	4422	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 express the way we feel or think, but can it be too graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries is needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others. Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic, ranging from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that involve a great deal of violence. Children's minds are like sponges, which means they soak up anything they read about, and it has a high chance of influencing their behavior in everyday activities. If you go into a music store, you will find many different types of music, from rap to bluegrass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap, and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this, why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2, and in every song, one of those four key topics comes up. Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1, the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' etc., and how they try to turn their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break. Movies like those are funny to watch, but for someone
1446	4423	2	3	I think what ever is offensive should be taken off of the shelf because it is inappropriate. Books are meant to be a source of enjoyment and learning. While a little violence in an action/adventure book can help set the mood of the character, establish the setting of the story, and aid in understanding, offensive content beyond that is unnecessary. Offensive books can be a tricky matter. For instance, a comedy magazine or book that makes fun of something or someone can be taken as offensive or just a joke. However, to most people, especially parents or friends, these offensive books can have a negative impact on children. Kids at a young age have impressionable minds, like sponges, and they learn and remember things easily. If a child gets hold of an offensive book, they are likely to remember what they read. I believe those kinds of books should be removed from the shelves. Kids are already exposed to such content on television and in daily conversations. They need educational books that can teach them and prepare them for their upcoming higher grade levels, giving them a fresh start with new words and grammar. In conclusion, the presence of offensive books in accessible places is not beneficial for children's development, and removing them is a necessary step to ensure a proper learning environment.
1447	4424	2	3	I think books and magazines should be taken off the shelves if they are too vulgar for young children. Specifically, if they deal with explicit content such as sex or extreme violence, they should not be on display. Only appropriate and age - suitable stuff should be allowed on the shelves. I firmly believe that publishers shouldn't even create such books or magazines unless they can keep them hidden from people under the age of @NUM2. Unfortunately, people often do what they want regardless of the potential harm. But we need to have some control to protect the young ones. In conclusion, setting boundaries on what is available to young children is crucial for their healthy development, and taking inappropriate materials off the shelves is a step in the right direction.
1448	4425	2	3	Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are too offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they should not be read. Throughout our lives, we often encounter things we don't like or want to deal with, yet it is beneficial to be exposed to them. Libraries should have the right to offer all types of books on their shelves without being censored by the public. As people of the @CAPS1, we have endured difficult times. Issues like @CAPS2, racism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few examples. Due to a lack of knowledge, we tend to repeat these problems. Slavery and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 events were some of the @CAPS1's darkest and most gruesome moments. Recalling these memories is difficult but necessary. If books were censored, many young adults would not be educated about these historical events and might repeat such horrible actions. The same principle applies to movies, music, and magazines. These publications often cover current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form of self - expression, and everyone has different tastes. Limiting the options is unfair. Music can not only express feelings of love or anger but also teach life lessons. Some artists share their life stories through their music, which can educate others about the consequences of certain actions. Magazines usually focus on current topics such as politics, jobs, or young adults' lifestyles. Movies also have the same rights and cover similar important topics. No group of citizens should have the power to decide what is inappropriate to read. The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, and censoring what people read takes away an author's right to express themselves. Although Katherine Paterson had a point, she is ultimately wrong. A library should be a place where people can access materials of any genre. Censoring materials is unfair to those who want to read them. In conclusion, we have the free will to choose what we read, and libraries should remain a place of open access.
1449	4426	2	3	There are things in the world that are not meant for certain people to see. Items like rated @CAPS1 movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music are inappropriate for children. While people have the right to view whatever they want, when it comes to children, it is the parents' choice, not the storekeeper's, to decide if a child can access such materials. If a child is under the age limit, a storekeeper should have the right to restrict their access. However, the question of whether a storekeeper should tell a child no is a complex one. For example, if a child tries to buy a rated @CAPS1 movie with guns, blood, and killing, and the parent doesn't want the child to have it, the parent might be angry if the storekeeper lets the child buy it. On the other hand, the parent might also be angry if the storekeeper refuses the child. Since the rating of @CAPS1 is based on maturity, it's difficult for a storekeeper to know how mature a child really is. A child might imitate what they see in movies, and the storekeeper has no way of knowing this. If a child watches a violent movie bought from the store and then goes out and commits a serious crime, both the storekeeper and the parents would feel terrible. This situation could be avoided with an age limit. Similarly, if a group of @NUM1 - year - olds who just got their licenses go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, without an age limit, there is no one to stop them from drinking and driving. Teenagers often don't think about the consequences of their actions, and many 12 - @NUM2 year - olds aren't mature enough to make responsible decisions on the spot. Therefore, there should be an age limit for certain things, not for everything like buying a candy bar or a soda. An age limit on buying @CAPS1 rated movies, alcohol, guns, knives, etc., is necessary. In conclusion, having age limits on these items helps protect the safety and well - being of young people and society as a whole.
1450	4427	2	3	What do you go to the library for? In the past, libraries were primarily places for studying. Since there were no computers, people had to visit libraries to look up information in educational books. But is that what people do at libraries today? Or are they there to access vulgar books, magazines, and movies? A library is supposed to be a peaceful place for work and a valuable source of educational materials. However, nowadays, people can be tempted to look at inappropriate materials. They might also spend the whole time on the computer playing games. There are many possibilities. People can check out materials on pornagraphy, drugs, alcohol, or even worse at the library. Is this what we want our kids to accidentally pick up? I personally witnessed a little kid pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mom had to quickly grab it before he could look at it. The library should not be a place where such things happen, and the risk of young kids accidentally accessing these materials needs to be eliminated. The music available at the library can also be very bad, and children might get exposed to it. If they like it and want to keep listening, it could have a negative impact on them. The world does influence what is in the library, as drugs, sex, scandals, and alcohol seem to interest many teenagers. But a library is a community building, and it's easy for people to access these vulgar things. The youth's thoughts can be easily swayed after being exposed to such content. Women and children often find these materials offensive. These materials need to be more strictly censored. Libraries should be a safe place for studying and getting books, not a place where people are tempted to look at inappropriate things. Many people find the current situation offensive. In conclusion, censoring inappropriate materials in libraries is essential to make them the safe and educational places they are meant to be.
1451	4428	2	3	A library card is one cherished thing that a kid always looked forward to obtaining. It's the first official piece of identification that many kids have, and they are allowed to proudly carry it around themselves. This little card opens up a whole new and exciting world of entertainment and stories that can transport you anywhere you want to go. Once a kid owned a library card, they were given the privilege to check out any book they desired out of the huge and diverse selection of items in a library. But a valid concern arises: how do you keep a young child from checking out a book, movie, or magazine about inappropriate adult material? A practical solution to this problem should be formed so that people can be effectively protected from material they don't want to see in a book, movie, or any other source of entertainment. Libraries today normally have a well - defined children's section, where colorful picture books and engaging short stories line the shelves. The rest of the building is a scattered arrangement of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre. The only way to understand what the item is about is to flip through the pages carefully or read the back cover attentively and try to find a hint of how the plot goes. This could be dangerous at times because not all materials give a specific and clear summary of what happens. I once rented a movie expecting it to be a thrilling scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park. It ended up being scary for another and unexpected reason, as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple of minutes of the feature. I had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like that and I was truly disgusted that there was no warning. I firmly believe items like that should be placed in a separate area or at least be required to give a detailed summary of the kind of offensive material in them. Libraries could collect viewer comments, allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it. People could then read these comments before checking out that item. Viewer comments would be a great way to get someone else's opinion on what the item contained before another decided to rent it. Another effective way to help this problem would be to give materials a certain rating, similar to the ratings of movies when they come out in theaters. A specific rating would clearly warn viewers or readers from checking out an item that is offensive or inappropriate. Libraries could also give specific age ranges according to the ratings on an item, not allowing anyone under a certain age limit to check out a book from the building. Ratings would help keep offensive books out of a child's hands, or that of anyone else who didn't want to be exposed. Libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could possibly think of. They can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items. I firmly believe items with offensive material should be either put in a separate area, or given a certain rating in order to warn people before checking it out. Allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful. Libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures, so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material.
1452	4429	2	3	Do you find books you read offensive? How about music, or magazines? I sure don't. I can't think of a valid reason why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read. If you sit back and carefully think about it, there should be a very low amount of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public. I believe that it is indeed possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directly directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone, then it is just a book. A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were commonly used during that time. They use them to vividly show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during that era. Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book just to put someone down. I tend to see books just objectively explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set an appropriate tone of the book. Music on the other hand could be thought of as different. Many people could take music in the wrong way. A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap. Rappers tend to express themselves thoroughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language. I personally don't get bothered by the music, because they are usually referring to their own life and how things went with them. Music can also be on the good side too. When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to soothe people and can be used to help people relax. Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly depends on who the person is and how they react to what they listen to. Then you have magazines. Personally I think they are the worst of all. Magazines tend to go one extreme way or the other. They either harshly put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are overly positive and say nothing but good about them. One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full and accurate story. In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about. Magazines always have a positive aspect, but where there is a positive they also have a harsh negative thing to put in with it. In these regards, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library. There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to predominantly stick with the positive side. Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it. With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that type of music. Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy. There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way. I don't believe there is anything wrong with libraries' censorship as long as you can use your own good judgment.
1453	4430	2	3	Imagine your all - time favorite book, song, and movie. The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read countless times over. The ones that you keep on eagerly checking out from the library again and again because you love them so much. Now, picture this: one day you go to the library, expecting to find your beloved item, but it's gone from the shelves. What happened to it? You initially think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do? When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge and rich selection of books and other materials to choose from. A library serves as a haven for many people of all ages, enabling them to choose whatever they are interested in. This is one of the main reasons why libraries are so popular among all people. If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore. I firmly believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Libraries should accommodate as many people as they are able. Removing material from the shelves might make some people happy, but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable. Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. Doing this could result in less diverse material for people of all ages. As Katherine Paterson wisely said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that if items were to be removed from the shelves, there would be less for others to enjoy. Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch. If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only prevent you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material. Many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive. While some might think that some books have subjects too racy for readers, others might not feel that this is the case. Take a popular children's book like Judy Blume's Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. To some, this might be one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book. They would have never had the chance to make their own opinions. I feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion. It is only natural to disagree with someone. You can always run into people that don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies. Eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people. If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only appeal to a certain audience. Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste. To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people. If an item that someone was looking forward to checking out was no longer available due to censorship, many people might even decide that they don't want to go to the library anymore. What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy. Censoring material would be like telling a reader that their opinions were not as important as those of the people who found it offensive. I believe that if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available to check out at the library, first think to yourself what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things. Because after all, what you think is offensive might be the best thing in the world to someone else.
1454	4431	2	3	Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of. What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books? My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then simply don't read it. I think they should have a well - defined children's section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about this problem. If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent accompany them. That way, the kid wouldn't bring home any books that their parent wouldn't approve of or allow them to read. If you are an adult and you don't like a book then just simply put it back on the shelf. Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf. They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want their children to see it because their children would need their permission to check out the book anyways. I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or that their parents would not approve of. By having separate sections and parental supervision for accessing the adult section, libraries can maintain a balance that respects the diverse interests and sensibilities of all patrons.
1455	4432	2	3	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be removed from our libraries? No, I don't think they should be removed. Instead, they could be placed in another part of the library, away from all the other books that aren't offensive. If they did decide to remove these books, our kids would have a hard time learning about the unvarnished truth. Book publishers often put only what they want our kids to learn. Most of the time they leave out bits and pieces about what really happened. So if they took the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines out, a lot of kids would just go home everyday and sit around idly or cause trouble. From my own personal experience, I enjoyed reading, listening, and watching the offensive materials they want to take out of our libraries. So if you don't like the offensive materials then don't even look at them. That will solve your problem, and you should also teach your children to do the same. Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials. If people still complain, move it to another part of the library, in a separate room or something of that kind. This should solve the problem of kids accidentally reading, listening, and watching these kinds of things. By keeping these materials in a designated area, libraries can still provide a comprehensive collection while also respecting the concerns of those who find certain content offensive.
1456	4433	2	3	I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. Everybody has their distinct likes and dislikes when it comes to music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If a reader does not like a book, then that reader will simply not continue reading the book. Similarly, if a listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and attempt to find a different kind of music. This topic is fundamentally about personal opinion and choice. If it were me, then I would whole - heartedly say yes to allowing censored materials. I have a strong preference for getting the full, unadulterated effect out of things. I want to hear the rawness of a song, the unfiltered emotion, or feel the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars replacing a censored word. I want to see that word in its entirety and feel its full impact.  I am actually in the process of reading the very controversial book '@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'. As you @MONTH1 are well - aware, the author of this book is named @PERSON1. Another well - known aspect is the use of the '@CAPS2 - word'. This is a highly controversial book because throughout most of it, he doesn't refer to colored people as black or colored; instead, he uses the '@CAPS2 - word'. Most people today think this is extremely racist. But back in @LOCATION1's era, it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't considered as overtly racist back then, though it still had an underlying negative connotation, but it wasn't as controversial as it is in modern times. Now, critics and some readers don't agree with this term and believe the book should not be held in libraries or read at all. However, I have to disagree. I understand why he used the word; it was a common part of the language in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose a significant part of the history of the old south.  People have the freedom of speech to express whatever they want, whether that be in written form or verbally. I, to be honest, do say some of these censored words on occasion. Most of the time, these words slip out when I am extremely angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say in the heat of the moment, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? It's just a thought. On the other hand, I can also see why people don't want these censored words around. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to accidentally say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's a valid concern, but you can't completely protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere, from video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their right to exercise their freedom as they see fit. In conclusion, while we should be mindful of the impact of our words, completely banning controversial books is not the answer as it takes away from historical accuracy and individual freedom.
1457	4434	2	3	I don't think that censorship in libraries is right, for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be freely accessible to everyone. Secondly, what you might perceive as inappropriate, might not be offensive to someone else. Lastly, an author has the right to express themselves in their book as they wish, without the constant worry that their book might be removed from the shelves of public libraries.  My first reason why I think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community. For example, if a student needed to conduct research on how black slaves were treated back in history, they might not be able to find a relevant book in the library. This could happen because someone thought books on this topic were offensive to black people. As a result, instead of going to the library for reliable information, the student will have to go elsewhere, where they might encounter the wrong type of information. This not only wastes the student's time but also undermines the purpose of the library as a reliable source of knowledge.  The second reason is that what you might consider offensive, might not be so to another person. So, why should your personal point of view affect another person's choices? It wouldn't be fair if the opinion of one person or a small group could limit the options available to others when they visit the library. Censorship could potentially remove your favorite series of books from the public library just because a group of people thought it was offensive. This restricts the diversity of reading materials and goes against the spirit of a free - access library.  My last reason is that an author has the right to express themselves in their book as they want, without having to worry that their book might get taken off the shelves of public libraries due to its contents. Sometimes, the content that might seem offensive is actually essential to make the book more descriptive and interesting to the reader. This content can help the reader understand the book better and gain a deeper insight into the story.  These are the reasons why I think that censorship is not right. If we had strict censorship in public libraries, then we wouldn't have many books left on the shelves for us to read. In conclusion, we should respect the rights of authors and the diverse interests of readers, and avoid unnecessary censorship in libraries.
1458	4435	2	3	No book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. Books are an incredibly important part of most people's daily lives. Whether they are utilized for educational purposes in school or simply for entertainment, books serve a good purpose and are always beneficial.  People have a wide range of different likes and interests, and everyone desires to be able to read what they want without having to constantly worry about whether the books will still be on the shelves tomorrow. For some individuals, books are an excellent way to pass the time. They not only help you learn new things but can also offer guidance and comfort during difficult life situations. Books are like a whole world to most people, and without them, those people would be at a loss as to how to spend their free time or gain knowledge. No one should be allowed to take away something that is so important to other people, even if it might be considered offensive by some.  All books have a purpose and a message that they aim to convey; otherwise, the authors would not have dedicated their time to writing them down and getting them published. The author writes to tell a story, whether it is a positive or a negative one. They want to share that story with the world to inform and engage people. These stories are clearly important to the author, and they are also important to the readers who enjoy their books. The authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what they wrote. If people are so offended, then they should simply stay away from the books written by that particular author. There are countless books available out there, written by many different authors, giving people a wide variety of choices. They do not have to take their offense out on certain authors just because they did not enjoy what others might find appealing.  There are so many books in existence, and it is almost inevitable that there will always be a book that offends someone. If we were to get rid of every single book that offends people, then we would not have many books left. And without books, we would lose a crucial source of education and entertainment. We will not be able to learn the new ideas that authors present if people keep getting offended and having the books removed from the shelves.  Books need to stay on the shelves. They are important to everyone, whether they are willing to admit it or not. Without books, people would not have achieved the level of knowledge and development that they have today. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of authors to express themselves and the right of readers to choose what they want to read, and keep books accessible to all.
1459	4436	2	3	Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public. This is of utmost importance because a child could easily gain access to offensive material if there is no proper censorship in place. Censorship is a vital measure for libraries as we do not want our children to be negatively influenced by offensive materials found within their premises.  The libraries would not even have to completely get rid of the offensive materials that they take from the general shelves. A practical and reasonable idea for them to implement is to move all of these materials to a separate section designated for adults. This way, the children will not be able to casually come across them. By doing so, the libraries would not be incurring any financial losses, and at the same time, they would be effectively keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for their age. There is no valid reason to give unrestricted access to material that could potentially be offensive to other people, especially children.  There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials. For instance, someone might need to use a book that has something offensive in it for a specific research project or academic purpose. However, if all such books are removed from the general shelves and moved elsewhere, it could pose a problem. I believe that it depends on how offensive the materials are as to whether or not they should be removed from the public shelves.  Although I am somewhat divided on this issue, there are some very good reasons for moving the offensive materials away from the general shelves. These materials are not suitable for the youth of our country, and they should not have easy access to them. We should implement censorship in libraries to ensure that nobody, especially the young and impressionable, gets hurt or negatively affected. In conclusion, while we need to balance the need for access to information, protecting the well - being of children through library censorship is a necessary step.
1460	4437	2	3	"Be a responsible parent or a considerate child if you are against censorship. Censorship is, in fact, really unavoidable in many aspects of life, and it should not be regarded as a major issue. If you don't want to read a magazine, a book, or watch a movie, then simply choose not to. Countless people avoid such content every day if they don't want to be exposed to it. At the same time, many people do choose to read and watch those so - called ""bad"" types of movies. It is ultimately a personal choice, and you don't have to be exposed to it if you don't wish to. Those who are against censorship can try various ways of keeping their children away from the inappropriate content or protecting themselves, but they shouldn't try to remove it completely.  One reason for censorship is that it provides a vast amount of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material, whether good or bad, that you get out of it is your choice to engage with. I think some of it can be beneficial for kids, not in the sense of corrupting them. Instead, it can help kids expand their imagination. However, I do believe that children should wait until they reach a certain age to read or watch this kind of material, until they are mature enough to distinguish reality from fiction. Also, it can teach valuable lessons that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real - life situations and what is going on in the world today. I think it is great for both kids and adults to be aware of what is happening around them. If you keep kids in the dark, then you deprive them of the right to form their own opinions. Any parent can tell their child that something is bad for them, but you can never truly know unless you experience it for yourself. Children can make up their own minds, and usually, they will do what is best for them.  Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are individuals who enjoy reading about fiction or engaging with what might be considered ""tacky"" things in life. It helps them get through a regular day. You never really know what somebody enjoys doing. If someone is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like, only to find out that they are unable to do so, there is a high chance that they will be extremely angry. If I were in a similar situation, I would probably be angry or depressed. It is not always a straightforward or non - controversial topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it, that's fine, but the people who can handle it don't want it to be out of public access. Also, keep such materials in libraries because if you don't want your kids to access them, don't give your kids library passes. However, if you do, supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who don't have the money or don't want to own the books shouldn't have to pay for them when it can be made available in a way that restricts access to those who need to be protected.  The last reason for censorship is that it keeps people interested. It also imparts a great deal of information. Not only does it entertain, but there is also a wealth of vocabulary that you can pick up from these books. I have personally learned most of my important lessons from books, and I hardly had to pay for any of them. When you don't have the money to buy all the books you want, the library has the same information available, but it's just more accessible rather than having to go to the store. Whoever finds it offensive, that's okay. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off the shelves, and it's not anyone's business what other people choose to see. If people really want to read these items, they will find a way. Banning them from one place is not going to eliminate censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this kind of content in school and on television. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.  Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral by different people. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand, nobody can force you to stay away"
1461	4438	2	3	Book @CAPS1          @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I don't think @CAPS4 books, magazines, and other reading materials should be taken off the shelf because. Books help people read and concentrate better. In my case, the more books available, the better it is. These books have been here to keep us occupied during our leisure time. Without them, we would have no brief description of what happened in the past. Books have always been here to support us, and every story must have some fun detail to engage the readers. Without books, I don't know what we would be doing in our free time.                                                                                                            Books have been the greatest thing in my life, and @CAPS5 it hurts for us to know that you want to get rid of them after you made us read them when we were kids. So what is the point of getting rid of them when we've come this far? In magazines, there's a lot to know about our people and how we live. We have worked hard to reach this stage. At least when we read, we learn how to do some certain things. For instance, do you remember when you were a kid and you always hated reading, but now, a whole new change has come into your life and you now know what to do. My favorite book I have ever read was the @CAPS6, and @CAPS5 was inappropriate but also had meaning. We have to keep these stories alive, and I'm not going to let you take away the thing we love to do.               I love books, and I hate to see them go away. These books were here when we were kids, and we have to keep the legacy up. Reading is the best thing in life, and @CAPS5 it helps clear our minds. Thanks to reading, I was able to explain to you this much and show how supportive I am of these books. @CAPS5 Removing the books would devastate our country, states, cities, schools, and reading clubs. So please don't remove our books. That's all we ask, and not only will you make me happy, but you'll make our readers very happy. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day.
1462	4439	2	3	Although possibly offending some people, materials that are in libraries that could possibly be considered 'offensive' are actually good to keep around. If people who find the materials in libraries offensive are getting upset over the lack of censorship within the library itself, they should re - think the situation and consider that the 'offensive' materials that are left within libraries could be considered appropriate IF the viewer is ready to experience them. For example, an adult who has a mature mindset might be able to handle and learn from materials that a child cannot. If a person does not want to be exposed to things in libraries that could be considered offensive, then they can altogether avoid these materials. They can simply skip over the sections or titles that seem unappealing. If parents find the materials that are within libraries offensive, they should monitor their children while they are visiting their library. They can guide their kids to appropriate books and help them make good choices. The materials that could be considered offensive @MONTH1 actually be good, educational media that a person could learn from. For instance, some historical books with graphic descriptions can teach us about the harsh realities of the past. If @CAPS1 within libraries increases, 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now.      Some books, movies, and any other number of things that can be found within libraries are being labeled as inappropriate. These materials can be educational, however, and should not be removed from libraries altogether just because some of the materials are found to be too crude, vulgar, or adult - like for younger ages. Parents should monitor their children while in a library as to not let them stumble upon something that they would not want them to see yet. If something is labeled as inappropriate for children to view by parents, then it is the parents' responsibility to make sure their child does not stumble upon it.      Much of what @MONTH1 be considered as inappropriate and needing censorship in libraries to this day @MONTH1 actually hold some educational value or meaning to it. There are books and movies that are based off of true stories that have taken place that could be announced by parents as 'not appropriate to be viewed by children'. However, this does not mean that libraries should have to remove the material from their shelves just because parents @MONTH1 not think or necessarily agree that it would be appropriate for their child to read or see. It is the parents' responsibility to see that their child does not check out what they would consider inappropriate. Much of the things within libraries that might be considered inappropriate for children hold good educational value and should not have to be removed from the shelves of the library simply because parents find it not age - appropriate for their children.      @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now so that those who want to see or read the stories or movies can do so without having to buy them. If parents want to make a big deal out of how libraries hold materials that are not appropriate for their children, they can either altogether not go to a library or they can monitor their children closely if they bring them along on a library visit. I have found that when I visit my library, I look at it as a source of knowledge that has been pooled in one place, written and created by thousands of authors, all of which took time out of their own lives to create it. If we are going to remove these books or movies from libraries, I think it would be taking away the rights that people have to the materials that SHOULD be provided by a library. @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is today so that people can enjoy all that should be within it, even if some of it is labeled as inappropriate by parents.
1463	4440	2	3	Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. In a democratic society, access to knowledge should be unrestricted. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. Everyone should have the chance to explore different ideas and perspectives. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I assume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstitutional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blindfold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is. For example, a book about a controversial historical event might be censored, but by doing so, we prevent people from understanding the full truth.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countries would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen. They can make an informed decision based on their own values.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming - of - age story about a boy. It helps young readers deal with the challenges of growing up.      In conclusion, I do not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to. There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand their knowledge and understanding of the world.
1464	4441	2	3	Censorship is very important, especially when you are referring to libraries. I believe that each individual person is entitled to an opinion. If a certain book, magazine, movie, etc., is offensive to one specific person or a wide variety of people, those individuals should consult an official who has authority and decides what goes on and off the shelves about what they think or feel about their choice of selection. They can have a proper discussion and present valid reasons.     In the world, there are many different types of minorities, racial groups, and also differences in political groups, (@CAPS1 and @CAPS2). Even though these separate groups are extremely different from one another, they all share one thing in common. No matter who believes what or who supports who, everyone will always have a difference in voice. Some people @MONTH1 feel that having particular material displayed on shelves of libraries is rather offensive to specific individuals. For example, a book with offensive stereotypes might be offensive to a particular ethnic group. Where as others like myself say, as said earlier, if you are to have a problem with something displayed, then you should contact someone who will listen to what you have to say. For example, I cannot express that I desire to have something removed from a library shelf just because I am the one who finds the material a concern. Not everything is decided by me. It would be incredibly rude to state that something is offensive to me might not be to someone else. Just because I don't approve of something gives me no right to purposely remove something from the shelf. That is all related to freedom of speech. However, yes, you do in fact have the right to say what bothers you, but you do not own the privilege of doing what you want at any time because you have opposed views. You need to respect the rights of others as well.     It is true to say that we all agree we do not want to see inappropriate material displayed on library shelves, especially for children's sake. Ergo, libraries should take major consideration of restricting specific areas of a library for adult views only. They can clearly mark these sections and have age - verification measures. I know suggestive material might be a concern for one, so not allowing children of a certain age to see certain material would be a highly good idea for any worried officials, adults, and parents. By implementing such measures, libraries can balance the freedom of access and the protection of younger patrons.
1465	4442	2	3	A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching through the various shelves and sections, I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any inappropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experience, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must.     Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated - @CAPS1 movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. @CAPS2 literature is not necessary and inappropriate for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations. For example, a child who reads a lot of violent and drug - related literature might be more likely to be influenced negatively.     The world has set their standards too low, and the children of today's society are following after our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson once said,     '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come. If we don't take action, the cycle of low - standard exposure will continue.     Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step - up and say something. I am a part of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I want to find the perfect book, I will be able to find one that is suitable and free from inappropriate content. This will create a healthier reading environment for everyone.
1466	4443	2	3	Every individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored. Schools, as educational institutions, have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that aren't appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. Schools surely do not want something inappropriate on their shelves where students can easily see it. Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. Younger kids, such as those of elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read. In public libraries, things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book. A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense. When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read. So, I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out. Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored. In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decide what they want to be allowed to check out. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship, considering both institutional responsibility and parental guidance, is the most reasonable way to ensure that people, especially the youth, are exposed to appropriate materials.
1467	4444	2	3	Well, if one person has a right to something, then it would only be fair for the other people to have a right to the same thing. That would be like having six kids in one room and, for no reason at all, just give three kids a cookie and not the other three. That wouldn't be right, now would it? So, if one person wants that book and then another person wants that same book, then they would have every right to grab that book, and there's really nothing one could say to them. I know how it feels not having the same right as everyone else. Like one time, my teacher gave my friend a piece of gum for no reason at all, and I was mad because I didn't get a piece. I thought if he got a piece of gum for no reason, then the rest of us should get one for no reason. As I said, if you give a right to one person, then you should give that right to another person. Now, I could understand if three people were involved in a fight and the third person was just standing there watching. That person doesn't have the right to go to jail, but the two that were physically fighting then they have every right to sit in jail and think about the fight. Now, the third guy that was watching, he doesn't have the right to keep any videos of the fight and he should get a ticket. In conclusion, fairness in the distribution of rights is crucial, and different situations call for appropriate judgment of who should have certain rights.
1468	4445	2	3	WHAT DO I THINK? When I heard about the problems some libraries were having, I thought to myself. What is the big issue over censoring movies, disks, books, and magazines? I know that children should not be around vulgar language, whether heard or read. Books that have inappropriate pictures should not be acceptable for the eyes of our young children either. The libraries should come up with a solution. I was thinking that if they want to, they could make rooms of books that are only for certain ages. When people take these books off the shelf to report it or put that book somewhere else away from their children, they make the people that work there jobs much harder. There should also be an adult with you if entering into the room. The adult must be 18 or older. If a child is found in there alone, the workers of the library will contact the child's parents as a first offense. The same thing goes for the second time you're caught. The third time you are caught, you will get a phone call to your parents and be banned from the library for three months. If you live in a big city, you may have bigger, better libraries. Some libraries have so many books, that you might have to get a cherry - picker to reach them. I know I'm a little off - topic now, but it is part of what I'm going to talk about. There are massive libraries and small libraries. It's almost like the difference between pre - school and college. Now that is a big difference. What I think the cities that have a bigger population should consist of two libraries side by side. The one on the left would be for toddlers ranging from 2 - 5. This library will be busy a lot. The library will consist of a day care so parents can look for a book in complete silence. The children at the ages of 6 - 12 will also be in the library on the left, but upstairs. They will have books made just for their age ranges. They will also be capable of watching TV or playing minor games that don't possess violence on the computer. The library on the right will look like a duplicate of the one on the left but is completely different on the inside. The reason they would do that is so kids would not try to get in because it looks cooler than the other. Our children look up to us in lots of different ways. Some may include copying our every move. So when they see what you watch, listen to, and even read, they might want to do that too. In conclusion, by implementing these library - related measures, we can better protect children from inappropriate materials and create a more suitable reading environment for different age groups.
1469	4446	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves because I don't see how they are offensive to other people. Even if it's war movies, they are telling what these men have gone through. They fought and lost their friends. You don't just see people killing and shooting; you see the emotions of the men, and it can evoke emotions in you to see that. Every book in there should stay there because some people need it for a project or to study about that person, and a lot of books have lots of history that you can learn from. The only thing that I think should be removed is the music. If it's rap or anything like that, it should not be allowed in libraries. It brings hatred and often glorifies killing in the lyrics, and that should not be allowed. Some magazines should be allowed, like racing, sports, or military, but all of the other bad stuff should stay out. Because if kids do see the kind of stuff that shouldn't be seen, it will get into their minds. In conclusion, while most materials in libraries have their value and should be kept, there are certain types, like some music and inappropriate magazines, that need to be excluded to create a healthy reading and learning environment.
1470	4447	2	3	There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines out there. Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie. They could even have stuff that young minds should not read. Have you ever thought about what would happen if a little kid grabbed onto something that he/she was not supposed to read? When it comes to things like this, there is a huge range of topics. Some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age. That's why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain range of ages are allowed to go. When it comes to books, there will always be some books that are not appropriate for the young mind. They could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life. Some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future. Books are great for learning, don't get me wrong, but there are some that are more adult - related. Now there are a ton of books that kids can read, and parents won't need to worry about them reading. Another way libraries can help is to put the movies in a certain section. The library could make a section called 'family and kids'. This section would hold a perfect spot where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids getting the wrong ideas from movies. In our library, we have this section. My grandma and I would always go there and find an incredible family movie to watch together. Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever. Finally, the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie. Clearly, a child of 5 shouldn't check out a movie that is rated R. That's just wrong. Libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie. That's why the movie companies rate movies, so they can give people a heads - up about what's good and bad about the movie. Also, the libraries should make sure a kid is checking out the appropriate type of magazine or book. The people that work there could look through it before and make sure it's the right type of book they should read. There are an infinite amount of ways we can protect the minds of young ones. I don't think libraries should ban books, magazines, movies, or even music. I think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what they're allowed to read. Books are a great way to learn things, but they should be learning about the stuff that is suitable for their age. Libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves. I believe people would get upset if they banned the stuff they love. They should just keep an eye out for what kids are looking at. In conclusion, libraries can play a crucial role in protecting young minds by implementing age - appropriate access and content - screening measures, rather than resorting to blanket bans.
1471	4448	2	3	How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had some @CAPS1 language or a nasty meaning? I mean, of course, there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so, you exclude some truly @CAPS1 great novels from the past. These novels were acceptable back then. If you want to censor books, do so in your own library. Personally, I don't believe in the censorship of books. If the author meant to write the book that way, then the writing should stay that exact way. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students. You might censor a school - book if it had extremely @CAPS1 graphic text between its covers. There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our society's ability to learn. Books, I believe, should not be offensive unless you're a self - conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience; it shouldn't be marred by censorships. In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading an exquisite novel that has a few @CAPS1 minor graphic details. I do not care if there is an explicit word in my reading. Albeit, some @CAPS1 naive persons have it in their will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture. Most @CAPS1 of the books written in today's world are far less explicit than before. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier. When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost a whole civilization's culture and literature. This should never happen to today's literature. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be losing a certain aspect of our culture. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries. The libraries are public for a reason. In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyers of classic literature, and it should never come to that.
1472	4449	2	3	I do not believe that they should be taken off the shelves because some @CAPS1 people still come to get that sort of stuff. Some @CAPS1 people say it is not polite for little kids. Well, keep your kids away from it then. Some @CAPS1 people don't like it and some @CAPS1 people do. I am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, because no one can tell us what we can and can't watch or say. It is our life. If we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it, we can. No one is telling people that they have to read it or even look at it. If you don't like it, don't look at it. That @CAPS2 kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what you're going to look at and away from kids. That @CAPS2 shouldn't even be a problem. That @CAPS2 is just people that think they are high - class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag. That is their opinion. In conclusion, I think if you don't read @CAPS2 stuff or watch @CAPS2 stuff, you are trying to be something you are not. Trying to act better than everyone because you're too high - class to read something like that. We all get a laugh out of that @CAPS2 kind of stuff.
1473	4450	2	3	In my opinion, books that might @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or might @MONTH1 come off as offensive. A person should be able to read an article without feeling like someone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well, say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable. Do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it. People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelves of libraries, there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person. Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like it when @CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@CAPS3.' When @CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking, they usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable. In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other people's, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion, you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to.
1474	4451	2	3	Should books, music, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own opinion on that question. In my years of reading, I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it. Personally, I don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growing up, our parents try to keep us from things that at that point in life we don't need to see. I can agree with age limits, but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know what's out there before you just let them go to find out on their own? You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views might @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting beside me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and listen to what you want. The world is not a safe place; it's scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certain things that they won't know and won't see. But that's just part of raising your kids. When they get older and start asking questions, I'm going to answer with the truth. Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth, we are telling them that it's not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day, there is segregation to all people, not just against races but in our own race itself. To conclude my opinion, I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't not let anyone see it and then let them out in the world and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children what's out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, who @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?
1475	4452	2	3	The last thing I would want my children seeing in a @CAPS1 is offensive material. A @CAPS1 is thought of as a learning zone, a place where people can learn about new things and expand their knowledge. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music, or inappropriate websites available to children, it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning environment. My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age - appropriate. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive materials. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the @CAPS1 should be monitored. If someone wants to look up inappropriate images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material. I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However, those might @MONTH1 be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I am, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they might @MONTH1 think that there is no real harm. But that might @MONTH1 just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some might @MONTH1 argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this, all morals would be forgotten. In some cases, morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious, and their particular religion might @MONTH1 be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a @CAPS1 with their children and find them staring at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocence. Having these things out in the open and accessible to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not. When I was a little girl, I remember going to the @CAPS1 often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appalled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then, my mom has been a little sceptical and dreads going to that @CAPS1. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article. I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform the general public of these issues and to explain my side of the argument. I don't see the reason for having these materials on hand at a @CAPS1 where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a @CAPS1, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this, I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, @PERSON1.
1476	4453	2	3	Children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day. These curious children are actively exploring the vast literature world to learn and grow intellectually. The library is a wonderful place filled with many genres of literature such as colorful children books, informative non - fiction books, engaging fiction books, adult books for more mature readers, and even movies that bring stories to life. There are certain genres carefully curated for specific age groups, and there are indeed a lot of materials in libraries that parents do not want their children to even hear the name of. I think that it is normal for parents to feel this way but it is not necessary. Children should have the right to explore the literature world however they want. Reading different types of literature is a terrific way of learning, and library shelves should not be stripped of the books occupying the space. There are many different types of books, movies, magazines, and music on the shelves in a library. These are all great forms of literature and a way of learning different things. Although, there are a lot of parents who do not want their children 'exposed' to such materials. If a child wants to read a book, let he or she read it for crying out loud! Parents might say that it is 'corrupting' their child, but books and music don't corrupt children; it's the environment and people around them that have the ability to cause such corruption. It is a very normal thing for a parent to be protective of his or her child, but to a certain extent. A parent is supposed to help their child grow and learn right from wrong. They have every right to protect their child from dangers in the world, but not to keep them from learning the art of literature. They're not supposed to shield their child from all the faults the world has, even if it is a book. Literature in every form is a great way of learning. Libraries shouldn't have to strip the shelves of wonderful books created in the literature world for one's entertainment or learning. If a child wants to read a book, they should have every right to read that book. They should be able to explore however they desire, as it enriches their minds and broadens their horizons.
1477	4454	2	3	Well, people who are adults should be able to get whatever they want because they are mature enough to make their own decisions. On the other hand, kids should not have unrestricted access as they lack the full understanding and judgment. But what can you do? It wouldn't be right to take away things that people, especially adults, like. Everyone has different preferences, and as long as it doesn't harm others, adults should be free to pursue what they desire. For kids, proper guidance is needed, but completely depriving them of all things might also limit their growth. In conclusion, a balanced approach should be taken to respect individual rights while also ensuring the well - being of all, especially the younger generation.
1478	4455	2	3	Libraries, they are everywhere, and all together they contain millions of books that have the power to influence everyone who reads them. Whether a book is being read about @PERSON1, a well - known figure, or the @CAPS1, a particular topic of interest, there is always something influential to be read. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages. The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes, those types of books are influential, yes, it is possible that it could negatively affect the youth of @DATE1, but everyone has the right to read what interests them. Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials. There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books. Is this a bad thing? Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience? No, having experiences is only half the point of living; sharing it is the rest. The @ORGANIZATION1 explains one of the more major downfalls in @LOCATION1 and how it brutally affected the people struggling for life and money. Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone. These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake. The youth of @DATE1 is portrayed in mostly a negative light. Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devil's offspring; our youth need positive influences. Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper. Most students find reading to be boring. In school, you are not offered what you want to read. Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught. Young adults need creativity, and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds. Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read. Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like. If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people; what would you do when suddenly everything sports - related was taken away? You would lose your career. Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds. Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe repercussions; especially for those who greatly enjoy those books. Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed. Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives. Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind. Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world. Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and I, am one of those thousands of people who understand the importance of literary freedom.
1479	4456	2	3	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Should those magazines and other items be put up in a place suitable for that age group? Should those types of things be in the @CAPS1 with children? Should they be in @CAPS1's period? I think that the @CAPS1 should have all types of books in there because that's what a @CAPS1 is for, to provide a wide range of knowledge and entertainment. But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have those types of books open to children, they should ask the @CAPS1 to change how they have the books arranged. But I also think the @CAPS1 should put those books up in a part where they have adult things and books at. Because those types of books aren't made for children's eyes. The @CAPS1 should put people's ages on the @CAPS1 cards so that this won't be a problem to the people or the @CAPS1. Because then you would know how old they are. And only @NUM1 years of age can see the books and magazines, etc., that aren't right for young children's eyes. But I do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and their children are reading it. And it is offensive to the people that just don't like what the book, music, and magazines stand for. One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taken off the shelves because there are so many people that come to the @CAPS1 just to read those books. And the people who read those books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves. Because personally, I like the magazines, books, music, and the movies, and I don't find nothing offensive about them. And I like the movies too because it gives me something to do and watch when I am at home. I also think that the movies and music are something we all love that's in the @CAPS1. Because it gives me and my friends something to do after school. So if you take away the things we like, what will we have to do after school when we go to the @CAPS1. And the things that were named make the @CAPS1 so fun and peaceful. The @CAPS1 is a place where you can come and wind your day down. Without those things they're trying to take off the shelves, it's going to be boring. People who don't have nothing to do during the day come to the @CAPS1 and look for that offensive stuff. In conclusion, a proper balance should be struck to ensure that both the interests of different age groups and the overall appeal of the @CAPS1 are maintained.
1480	4457	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. People should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that another person will also find it offensive. The libraries need to let the community deem what they find offensive or not. Some parents say that they do not want bad or certain materials in the library because their children might read it. If parents are that concerned about what their children see, then they should sit down with their child and have a detailed discussion about why they should not be able to read or watch that type of material. Parents should be able to make their children understand why they shouldn't read or watch the certain material instead of accusing the libraries themselves just for having the material. If some books or movies are deemed very offensive by the public, then they should be placed in a special area. This special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says '@CAPS1 content' and should only be able to be viewed by adults. This would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials. Doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material. This would also solve a problem because it would be in a back corner or area that not many people go to so children will not very easily see it. The best solution to this problem would still allow the libraries to put certain material that are found offensive in their libraries. But instead, put age restrictions on being able to check out the material and also put it in a different section of the library than the normal material. This way, the rights of both adults and children are respected, and the library can still serve as a place of diverse knowledge and entertainment.
1481	4458	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs. For instance, a book that graphically depicts drug use might be a concern for parents worried about the influence on their children. But libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves. There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it. Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves.   One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because of what Katherine Paterson said in her quote. She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf. Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day. Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library.   Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this. As you know, there is a large number of different cultural families living in the @LOCATION1. Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries. Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing. How would a library handle this situation? If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries, there would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it. Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it, they would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves. There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves.   My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies. Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental businesses, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve. If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business. And in my perspective, the only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner. It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc. The public has to accept those choices. You have to look at it from their view. Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them? It's just not the right way to handle things.   After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that. It's never been that way and it should never be that way. Obviously parents don't want their kids to see inappropriate things. But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be.
1482	4459	2	3	Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more widespread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single person's individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.   Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books, we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.   When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friend's eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' At first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.   There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. At this point, we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.   So next time you pick up a book from the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad at but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and cultures, and take responsibility for our own reading choices in the library.
1483	4460	2	3	I strongly feel that every book was created for people to read and gain knowledge, on whatever aspect of what the book is about. If your children are looking at things they should not be looking at, you should keep your child away from that section. Every person has a different style of books that they like to read, they should not have to lose those books because children are looking at things they're not supposed to. What would be the point in a library if you cannot have certain materials inside it?   My view on censorship in libraries would have to be that those 'bad' sections should be off limits to children. All libraries are divided up into different sections like; fiction, non - fiction, fantasy, children's books. Those sections were created for a reason. If people choose to let their children read books from any section then that is fine with me. Although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library. I feel that if that one parent complains and no one else does, then they should not be allowed in that library anymore.   I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be excluded from a library. Just because a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have, I feel that parents should be responsible for what their kids are looking at, and not make libraries take books off their shelves. Everything from books to movies were put in the libraries for educational reasons. There should be laws that say those things are put into a library for a certain reason, and if customers do not like that they can go somewhere else.   My own experience being a volunteer at a local library is that there are many things that were put into a library for a reason. Every movie, book, and magazine have information about something that you @MONTH1 might want to know. Books are put in libraries for people's pleasure and love for reading. All those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading. Movies at a library are put there for educational reasons like: to teach kids to count, and to learn something about a certain topic. Magazines could just be in a library for people to read and relax, and learn something new in the world.   I really feel that parents should watch what their children are reading, and you should think the same. Libraries should not have to remove books from their shelves that have been there for a really long time. Materials like movies, books, magazines, and music should never be taken away from a library. What would be the point in having a library around if you could not go check a book, movie, or CD out that interests you? In conclusion, libraries should remain a place where a wide range of materials are available, and parents should take on the responsibility of guiding their children's reading choices.
1484	4461	2	3	Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidentally' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.   Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? '@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.   However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. @CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.   The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, etc. in there. Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their minds safer.   Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3. In this way, the library can balance the need for providing diverse materials and protecting the well - being of children.
1485	4462	2	3	I believe censorship is necessary. If all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn @DATE1, we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow. It's important that we are held back somewhat by these offensive outlets in order that we grow into mentally healthy adults. However, censorship can go too far. When it comes to the removing an author's work from a public library altogether, we have crossed the line. With the @CAPS2 given us by our founding fathers, our @CAPS2 given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, I submit that it is a crime to remove the hard work of authors and artists from the shelves.   Of course, the first point of argument that comes to mind to defend my position is the fact that we are all given a legal right to express ourselves through the @NUM1 amendment of our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. The writers of this @CAPS1 were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people. That law still exists @DATE1 and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work, their words, and their ideas out in the world. As far as I know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal. Still, even with this point made, some @MONTH1 may not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want.   A man by the name of @PERSON4 comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media. @PERSON4 was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human @CAPS2 activist. I think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument. @PERSON4 was known to be a firm atheist and secular humanist (one who believes that there is nothing more important than the physical human body), but he gave the same argument I'm giving @DATE1, and I'm a catholic. @PERSON4 spoke out against censorship, saying that it was a way to judge artists on their work when it wasn't even listened to fully. If someone as convincing and passionate as @PERSON4 could feel that way when he didn't even believe in a @CAPS4, then everyone should see that the human race, whether they believe in a @CAPS4 or not, is given the right for their creation to be revealed. In some cases, it's necessary and needed for people to show their ideas to the public.   @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON3 even, and the list goes on. These people, although from different worlds and different times and different people, were all avid believers in the @CAPS2 of humans. Imagine if @CAPS3 had just said, 'I don't think people want to hear me so I'll just stop and let someone else take over for a little bit.' Do you think the world would be as
1486	4463	2	3	Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest bits of discreet history, political corruption, and inappropriate sights from a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future. Censorship is extremely dangerous to a society because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor Greta Thunberg and many other environmentalists around the globe of the climate change possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about George W. Bush's censorship of his oil distribution among the Middle East (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment. Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the Holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that Christmas may cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellectual. Then think of all the sudden problems it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The Giver' by Lois Lowry, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the Elsewhere', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology. Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the Osama bin Laden killing was nothing of anyone's awareness except the intelligence of the CIA, military, and government officials. That was a thoughtful choice from the authorities as well instead of announcing it on national news. I'd rather of course be notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or 'The Color Purple' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hear a historical racist Caucasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it. Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, bookstores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship... In conclusion, censorship restricts our access to knowledge and can have far - reaching negative impacts on society, so it should be kept in check.
1487	4464	2	3	Dear, Katherine Paterson. I was thinking about if the items you listed are offensive. Well, I believe that this is a free country and that all people should be treated equal. What I'm trying to get to is that the newspaper organization should keep doing what they do! In fact, they should add more. Yes, there should be restrictions on some things but to solve the under - age buying problem, just make people use their ID. By doing this, I think this would solve a lot of issues. Taking it all away would be a little too serious for just some magazines or movies. So keep doing what you're doing, just set a higher restriction on sales and things should be just fine. In conclusion, with proper ID - based restrictions, the issues related to offensive items and under - age access can be effectively managed.
1488	4465	2	3	This writing is socially unacceptable! There are many books and media sources that include: language, sexual tones, and other immoral things and ideas. However, culture does need to be obtained. Although immorality on this earth is at an all - time high, we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the shelves and turn our attention to people's hearts, and turn to morally right things. When a person walks into a library, he or she can expect certain things, for example: the smell of the older books, the noise of a group of kids, and the yelling of the librarian to keep them quiet. What he or she would not expect is: kids doing drugs, and watching porn on the computers. This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers' fault. This is the fault of an immoral world. I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system and it gets worse every day. There is good, but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet. I can quote from many, in my 8th grade class that have told me 'The only thing that is wrong, is telling someone they are'. This thought process is immoral. But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer. Jesus is the answer. In the Bible it says, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This is truth. In the book of Romans it says, God gave many people over to their sinful passions. God is the only good, and the only light comes from Jesus. The only man to live a perfect life was Jesus Christ and he was God in a human body. We as a planet need to turn to God, the only good thing. And try to be like God, because this world needs God. Only God can change a heart. We need to focus on God. Once we do that, the way we think, and the way we write, and the way we act, will change and we will not need to discuss this problem any longer. In conclusion, by turning to God, we can address the moral decay in society and bring about positive change.
1489	4466	2	3	I think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored. It is wrong to make fun of or joke about people. Mocking a disability like there have been movies made doing. Well actually, there is a movie I've seen before called The Ringer and it's a guy that made fun of a special olympic team, then lied about having a disability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine. That would be something that I myself would want to take off shelves because there is no reason to mock a disability. I wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not so maybe depending on what the offensive information is tells them something shouldn't be brought out. In conclusion, offensive content that mocks others, especially those with disabilities, should be censored, and a proper system for deciding shelf - worthy content is needed.
1490	4467	2	3	I don't believe that any kind of material such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be censored except for mature content such as pornography, violent and horrid movies and video games. But that's why we have age - rating organizations made. So when asked, we can show our age. Some age groups react differently to mature contents. Usually 18 and up is a tolerable level for maturity to set in. Maturity is maintained at different paces in all age groups. For example, perhaps a 16 - year - old is more mature than a 20 - year - old. It is when you as an individual can act like a human being. Instead of like a pack of rabid wolves. Just because you do not act mature doesn't mean you don't know how to be civilized. The best way to prevent a child from discovering something inappropriate or vulgar is to, separate the books by an age - grouping system. Keep adult videos out of sight and reach of children. Also put safety locks on your TV to prevent kids from sneaking behind your back. In conclusion, by using age - rating systems and proper safety measures, we can protect children from inappropriate content without over - censoring other materials.
1491	4468	2	3	Everyone has a unique opinion. Don't you agree? That's precisely what makes us different as individuals. This is why some of us would rather sit back and watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2, or why some prefer to listen to the catchy beats of pop instead of the soulful tunes of country. A library is an extraordinary place that brings all sorts of people, with their diverse interests and backgrounds, together. It's a place brimming with interest and a vast repository of information, a haven for research and a source of pure enjoyment. So here is my thought - provoking question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive?' I don't believe so, as the wise quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I whole - heartedly agree with that statement! Think about this scenario, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, and if everyone had that right, we would end up with no more books, no materials left for us to study or for the simple pleasure of reading. I have to admit I've come across things in the library that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might find them fascinating. You can't just have a library all to yourself, filled only with things that match your interests and no one else's. That's not the purpose of a library. Millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So, no, I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Just pick up what you find interesting and leave it at that. We all have rights, just like we all have our likes, dislikes, and minds of our own. Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more. They advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons in unexpected ways. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together. That's my firm position on this topic, and I hope this helped you form your own well - thought - out stance.
1492	4469	2	3	Books in libraries are available to everyone, so it's a valid question to ask who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not. This is a very controversial topic that often sparks heated debates. On one side, parents are understandably worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They firmly believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be practically worthless to even get a library card. I believe that it is the crucial job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed strong morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong every single day, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision. As a teenager, I know from personal experience that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the precious idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the audacity to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that. Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find in - depth information about the topic, I had to check out multiple books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people important lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their own beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them. People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices every day. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same kind of decision - making. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do. In conclusion, the decision of what to access in the library should be left to individual judgment, and the freedom of choice should be preserved.
1493	4470	2	3	Yes, I do firmly believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to put yourself in the other person's shoes and think about it from their perspective. Imagine you went to the library regularly, and that certain offensive thing was constantly there, or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head. That would be a tough problem to deal with during your every - day visit to the library, and also in your everyday life outside of it. One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you, and another person knows it offends you, then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things. Another reason I believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that library very often. I mean, if you have to see that offensive book every day, don't you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit? So what I am trying to say is I do believe if there is an offensive book on a shelf, it should be removed. Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you happen to hear in passing. Books are things you read, and the words are right there in front of you. I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books usually say it right there in black and white, and there's also the possibility of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then take action and fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of your life. So get it fixed now or just find a way to get over whatever you find offensive. In the end, creating a comfortable and non - offensive environment in the library is essential for everyone's well - being.
1494	4471	2	3	Books are pieces of art, crafted with care and creativity. Authors are true artists, using words as their brushstrokes. Writing is a powerful form of expression, and in the @CAPS1, it grants the precious freedom of expression. I do not think we should deny anyone that fundamental freedom. I do not believe books or any other form of art should be removed from the shelves of libraries. I understand that parents do not want their children seeing or hearing certain things. People have a natural desire to keep children naive and innocent. The thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up. They are naturally curious beings. They will want to know about the world, and they will want to see it in all its complexity. You can not hide things from them forever. I believe in what @PERSON2, my favorite musician, once said '@CAPS2 covering your childrens eyes...' The world can be a bad place, and you want to protect them from that, but it can also be incredibly beautiful. There is so much that children, and just normal people, would miss out on if we took down every thing that someone said was 'offensive'. Also, there is the crucial question of, what is offensive? Who decides? Where do we draw the line? Like Katherine Paterson said, soon we would have no books left on our shelves. Because everyone has a different opinion. People can find the most innocent things offensive. If you do not want your children reading or hearing certain things, then have an open conversation with them and tell them so. Do not ruin it for other people. To each his own. Different people like different things. Something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful and inspiring to someone else. '@CAPS3 mans trash is another man's treasure.' Books, music, movies, they are all art forms. People have the right to express themselves. We already censor so much in our society. I think when you censor things it takes away from the original essence of the work. If you do not particularly like something, then it is your choice to not read it. It is your choice to not listen to it. You can choose for your children, but you can not choose for others. People have a right to do what they want, as long as it doesn't harm others. People have a right to do what makes them happy. They have a right to read, watch, or listen to what makes them happy. They have a right to create what makes them happy. You have no right to take that away from someone. Books do not kill people. Music does not kill people. They can make you uncomfortable. They can even make you sick or angry, but they do not harm anyone physically. People make decisions, and people control their own actions. Books, videos, art, does not harm people. All in all, I do not believe any books, music, movies, or any other forms of art should be removed from the shelves. There could be age limits for certain things, or specific sections for more adult - oriented things, but I do not believe any @CAPS3 should have the choice to decide what is right for someone else. You can shelter your children if you would like. You can avoid things you find offensive. But please do not take away an opportunity for another. A wonderful book, or a life - changing piece of music could be taken away from someone, because you found it 'offensive'. We should respect the freedom of expression and the diversity of opinions in the realm of art.
1495	4472	2	3	Books are part of history, and no book should be censored. They serve as important records that show and teach us about history. If the book is based on true events, nothing should be censored because it gives us an unfiltered view of the past. Many books from the @DATE1's and earlier have words that younger children should not see yet. In today's world, with how the human race is, everyone is going to encounter something bad or even see something inappropriate at some point. It's just like saying all websites should be censored, which is an unrealistic and over - reaching idea. A book that needs to be censored should not be in an @CAPS1 school. I would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher in the educational process should be used, no matter the content in it. This is why a teacher needs to read the book thoroughly before assigning it to the students. If he/she thinks the students will not act appropriately after reading it, then the book should not be used in the classroom. If we start censoring books based on individual sensitivities, a lot of books would be removed or censored from shelves. If you do not want to hear those offensive words or see certain images, then you should not have gotten that book in the first place. Many people would be made mad if extensive censorship did happen. I would be too because sometimes a whole chapter could be considered bad or in music a whole lyric could be inappropriate. Many people are already mad about the idea of censorship, but everyone else would be mad if widespread censorship happened. In conclusion, while we need to be mindful of the content children are exposed to, we should not overly censor books as they are important historical and educational resources.
1496	4473	2	3	Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds absolutely crazy. I can understand how some people might be offended by certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but there are also many people who truly appreciate such content. It's all about diversity. Some people love the down - to - earth literature that gets straight to the point, while others simply can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with?  I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive ones, but it is all based on facts. I mean, if this is such a big problem, there should be a specific section in the library to find those things. If people want to complain, then they can just get out of that section because people like me will be in that section, eager to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment, whether it's offensive or not.  People @MONTH1 find some of it offensive, but I believe it actually makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated in the way described in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does!  Even though I hear of people reading offensive books, I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should have a rational conversation with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for those types of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will eventually get over it.  Now that you've read what I had to say, what do you think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy, allowing everyone to enjoy the diverse offerings in the library.
1497	4474	2	3	Should we have censorship in our libraries? This is a complex question that both sides can argue with valid and creditable facts. However, censorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard of until a person reaches a mature age. But how can you precisely tell when someone is of a mature age? Maturity lies within an individual's ability to cope with various thoughts, ideas, and actions. Censorship should be allowed to a reasonable extent.  Censorship plays a significant role in society today. It has brought about a remarkable change in the content on our television from @NUM1 years ago to the modern - day. The government is more lenient today than they were @NUM1 years ago. On television @NUM1 years ago, you would never hear a swear word, or see a couple sleep in the same bed. Now, some swear words are considered okay because people can handle them. It's as if they have become part of our daily vocabulary now. Censorship has indeed changed a lot.  Books of all sorts should be accessible to children and adults of all ages. Certain literature provides a rich variety of topics and subjects that are beneficial to a developing brain. We learn and understand at different rates. Some books with 'adult content' @MONTH1 be suitable for more intelligent minds. Authors sometimes put in so - called 'adult content' to add suspense and drama towards the bigger picture or message behind their work. Books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning.  Movies are different. Some movies have sexual content that our youth should not be exposed to. Most magazines follow the same principles as movies do. They are both rated differently according to age levels. Therefore, we can protect the innocence of our youth. Music is healthy for a person's mood. Music should not be censored. People just have different tastes in music. Some @MONTH1 be fond of other genres and some @MONTH1 dislike the other genres. There is a wide array of music that people can enjoy. There is no way to censor the universal language that music provides.  Censorship should ultimately come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear. Censorship of books is not appropriate, but censorship of movies and magazines is acceptable. Music, however, cannot be censored. The lyrics and sounds speak to many people in unique ways. It is all helpful in the end. Everyone should have the right to watch, read, or listen to whatever they want. It all comes down to learning, and there is no place for censorship in the pursuit of knowledge. So, please do not censor our libraries. Allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their families, ensuring a balanced approach to access and protection.
1498	4475	2	3	I don't think people should remove the books, movies, and music from the library because it's the people's choice to read, listen, and watch the things they want. Why should people change their preferences just because other people can't handle the content? If the people want to read, watch, or listen to so - called 'bad stuff', they should be able to do so. It's not other people's place to decide.  The people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read, watch, or listen to. They will discover by themselves what they want to hear or listen to. As parents or individuals, they will also find out what they want their kids to read, listen, and watch.  This is what I think of this issue. It should be up to the people to choose what they want to listen and hear. Everyone has the right to make their own decisions about the media they consume, and we should respect that freedom of choice in the library environment.
1499	4476	2	3	I feel that a person has the right to go to a library and get a book, magazine, movie, or whatever else they might need because someone could use the material for important information they @MONTH1 require. I, however, do feel that it should be handled in a mature way. For instance, inappropriate material @CAPS1 be kept in a special area or somewhere where a child or a person who doesn't need that kind of material won't easily access it. I think if it is something meant for adults only, there should be no way for a child to get a hold of it.  A person does have a right, I feel, to go to the library and get whatever book they @MONTH1 need for personal information to help themselves or for a research paper they are working on. Anything inappropriate should have its own designated spot away from other materials.  As I have mentioned, I do feel that there should be some protection for children. Firstly, they do not need to be reading about something that is beyond their comprehension, and secondly, for someone who doesn't really need that information to help them with their own learning.  I think there are many things that can help prevent someone from feeling like the library needs strict censorship. One important measure would be to have a special room just for things that are deemed inappropriate to someone. This leads me to my next point: there should be a dedicated worker whose job is to determine if something should be kept in a special room. I think there definitely should be a certain age requirement to enter a room for uncensored materials. If they do not meet the requirements, they should not be allowed in. In some cases, they should have to explain why they want that certain material just to ensure it is for all the right reasons.  As I have mentioned, I do feel that everything should be allowed because it could be needed by someone for personal information or for a classroom assignment that requires information. But I also do feel that there should be some rules and requirements as to what is appropriate and what is not. If that person has a legitimate reason for needing something, I don't see the harm in them getting what they need. By implementing these reasonable measures, we can strike a balance between access to information and protecting those who may be vulnerable.
1500	4477	2	3	How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't have certain food in your fridge because it's bad for your health or they might think it tastes bad? You would not be too happy about it. Well, it's the same principle when people want to censor the libraries.  When people try to censor the libraries, they attempt to take out books that are considered 'offensive'. If someone likes those kinds of books and they are being removed, it's unfair for that person because they are being limited on what they can get from the libraries. Libraries are supposed to be a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy, but they can't do that because people are trying to censor the books.  The people that want to censor certain books say that they might be offensive not only to them but also for the kids. Well, I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to that section. You don't have to read those books; you can just leave them alone for the people that like reading them.  To the people that want to censor certain books, what exactly makes a book offensive? Who is to say if that is offensive or not? The two views are different. Just because one person thinks it's offensive doesn't mean another person thinks the same.  My opinion is to leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read. No book is bad. Every book does good for you because it builds your education, it could also be a stress reliever, and it's something you can enjoy in your free time. The people that are being deprived of the books they like because they are being censored are at a loss. What if the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series got censored because of the magic? To some people that might be an offensive book, and if that book was taken off the shelf, we would lose one of the greatest books and @CAPS3 of people would be upset.  So, the way I see it, everyone should be entitled to choose what books they can read. To the people that don't like certain books, just leave them there. If you don't like to read them, that's fine. Everyone is entitled to their rights, as Katherine Paterson said, 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So we should all be able to read what we enjoy, allowing the rich diversity of literature to thrive in libraries for the benefit of all readers.
1501	4478	2	3	Books should be removed only if they are found to be offensive to a significant degree. Some other books, though, are specifically meant for educational use and are not intended to offend anyone. People sometimes take things too seriously and misinterpret the purpose of these books. Many books have served as a great educational source for numerous years.   Books have been around for a very long time. People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in the form of pictures to tell stories. Stories have been a part of human culture for ages and are meant to be just that - stories, not pieces of work to be criticized and used to put down other people. There are, however, a lot of books that have been created with the intention of putting others down. These books, I firmly believe, should be taken off the shelves since they might incite people to turn against certain races.   A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but might seem so at first glance is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. This book has been carefully crafted for people to read and gain insights into the life back when there was slavery or in a time just after slavery when people did not respect the newly freed men. Another book that tells of the times during slavery is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. This book follows the journey of a young boy who runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named @PERSON1. It has been written to depict what slaves would face as punishment if they were caught.   Many other books exist like these. But I guarantee that over ninety percent of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context in which they have been written. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past couple of years, and I find that many of the books I've read have proven to be educational for me.   There are some books, though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being overly offensive. Censorship has a role to play in protecting us from many disturbing topics, and I agree that certain books should be removed. But, I think that sometimes, places go overboard with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are appropriate for a place, as well as movies. The world is constantly maturing, and people are learning all the time. There should be some censorship in public places, but only for over - the - top topics where authors have written about an issue that will offend a large number of people. In conclusion, a balanced approach to book selection and censorship is essential to ensure that the educational value of books is preserved while protecting the sensibilities of the public.
1502	4479	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it, when you go into a library, there is a vast array of books to choose from. But how many do you think are appropriate for every age, including children? Not very many. That is why libraries have sections for the books, but there are times when people are rude and mix them up on purpose.   How many times have you been in a library and found a misplaced book? Many times, right? That can be accidental or, unfortunately, on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a library and they got a book that was inappropriate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now, if it was a book that had been misplaced, I would simply take it from them. But, yes, there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the library.   I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad. It didn't matter; they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read. But one day, my mom took me to get books from the library. She didn't think about looking at the books I got until we got home, and she realized one of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all. I had no clue what she was doing, but I figured it out. She grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining. I can remember her every word; it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2. She is six years old. We were just here about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well, if you can give me a good reason for why my six - year - old daughter has a children's book from here with cursing in it, please speak up and explain. I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned. She had never had someone go off on her in the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library. I can't remember the title of this book, but I know that with a mom like mine, she can get things done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation that you can achieve what you want with a little determination and persuasion. It might cause a bit of trouble, but if you set your mind to it, you can help and solve problems. In conclusion, while it's important to protect children from inappropriate content, we also need to be careful not to over - censor and end up with an empty library.
1503	4480	2	3	When you have children, would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society, even though we have freedom of speech, the government has come up with something that conflicts with it - censorship.   One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be restricted on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis. If it isn't on the radio, it's on television, where someone's words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or inappropriate.   The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is, someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes, we read an article about a very popular children's and young adult's film, and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of the people I know who have read those books know that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different. I find that as unique, not bad.   The third thing is that no matter what, public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something that someone else might find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all, the library is public, and I put a great deal of emphasis on it being public because every person in the world today is different.   Today in society, even though we have freedom of speech, the government has come up with something to conflict with it - censorship. Leaving off on a lighter note, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problems stem from trying to control everything that everyone does. In conclusion, we should strive to maintain a balance between protecting the public from harmful content and respecting individual freedoms, especially in public institutions like libraries.
1504	4481	2	3	Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't impose their view on censorship; rather, the people who rent or buy the items should have a say. The @CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive, but they shouldn't be the ones to make that final decision. If the @CAPS1 wants to keep their business thriving, they should try to make sure the customers are happy. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants to better understand the needs and preferences of their patrons.   Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is an offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. The different views of people can vary greatly, from a lot to none at all. If the people feel that an item is offensive, they should bring it up with the @CAPS1 and work together to find a solution instead of simply getting rid of these items. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for the items that the @CAPS1 or the people claim to be offensive.   Another possible solution would be to just rearrange the areas of the books into two main categories such as offensive and non - offensive, and then break them down into their specific sub - categories. So, the libraries need to conduct surveys showing what items the people think are bad and also take into account the library's opinions and then proceed from there. The surveys could be in the form of a paper one that you fill out in the @CAPS1 or through its online website. The survey would have a comprehensive list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off.   Now, the @CAPS1 needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. So, if the @CAPS1 feels that a book is offensive, they shouldn't have the right to censor it. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time. Why change it now? Think about it. If it was offensive, why did they put it into the @CAPS1 in the first place?   So, in conclusion, the @CAPS1 should have no right to censor books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. This would cost time and money, which they don't have to spare. Customers could possibly stop coming in because of the change, which would result in a loss of money. Everyone knows that a big loss of money could hurt any business and possibly bankrupt them, or it could take weeks, months, or even years to recover. No business wants that. So, the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen is to just leave everything the way it is and focus on better serving the diverse needs of their customers.
1505	4482	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed if they are offensive to a race or any other kind of beliefs, unless they are part of a biological or historical timeline. If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your beliefs, you might want to approach a librarian and express your concerns so that the reading material can be removed from the shelves.   I think that if something goes against something in a bad way, it should be removed. I've read a magazine before, and it had some offensive content. I went to the librarian and told her that I wanted this magazine off the shelves. We had an argument for about five minutes, but finally, the magazine was removed from the shelves.   Nobody wants something to go against them in any way. That's why we should have offensive material removed from our libraries' shelves. In conclusion, while it's important to respect different beliefs and cultures, libraries should also be a place where offensive content is minimized to ensure a comfortable and inclusive environment for all patrons.
1506	4483	2	3	PARENTS @CAPS1. As a parent, I understand the concerns when it comes to the materials our @CAPS2 are exposed to. @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I firmly believe that certain materials should not be shown. But then some books are not offensive to everybody, so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries. I can relate to @CAPS2 discovering books that aren't educational for them. It's up to the parents to show their @CAPS2 what to read and what not to read. This can also happen with movies, certain movies that @CAPS2 can and can't watch. The reason I say this is because if it was up to @CAPS2 on their own to decide what they would want to do, it would usually lead to negative results. That's what parents are for. I was young myself and I had experienced this too at one point. The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young to realize what I was watching and what I was trying to do from a movie. I had to learn from my parents that the things I was doing were not rational. Then I realized that I was making mistakes. It was nothing cool about it. My friends had told me that as well. So I figured it out the hard way. I don't want any @CAPS2 to experience that. Not all parents can stop all @CAPS2 from discovering some disturbing things from books, music, magazines and all. What I'm trying to say is that it can be reduced. Some parents can prevent it from happening. Some things can get into a @CAPS2's brain and it could never be helped or solved. These things are serious and some people don't take it lightly. And that's where it takes effect. It's up to kids' parents or role models to show that some things aren't meant for them to see until the right time. I'm not telling parents to trap their @CAPS2 from the world. What I'm saying is that parents should let them know that they're going to witness some things. They just have to be prepared to see them and hopefully it doesn't take a negative impact on them. Hopefully they would be smart enough to tell what's right from wrong. It's up to the parents to assist their @CAPS2. It's up to the @CAPS2 to know what's good for them. I do believe that some @CAPS2 are capable of growing out of some events they learned from movies, to know that they were young, because I grew out of that myself. And if I can do it, so can they. It's not impossible. One good thing is that some @CAPS2 grow up in a positive community to know not to read disturbing books/magazines, or watch disturbing movies. In conclusion, while we can't completely shield @CAPS2 from all inappropriate materials, parents and role models play a crucial role in guiding them and helping them make the right choices.
1507	4484	2	3	Do I think that certain materials that are offensive to other people be removed from the libraries? In my opinion, I say no to this question. I say this because another person in the library might like the certain material that you find offensive. I don't think certain things that are offensive to one person should be removed. It can be an enjoyable read for the next person. In the following paragraphs, I will continue to support more of my answer. A library is built for other people's enjoyment. If a person finds something offensive to them, I don't think they should get mad because it wasn't put there to hurt you. Maybe the person that wrote the book went through the exact same thing you did. Most people write books, create music, and produce movies to express themselves. They put things out there like that because they could encourage someone else. Personally, I have never found a book, song, or movie to be offensive to me. I know that the person writing the book wasn't talking to me, so I don't see why I have the right to get upset, and that goes for everybody else. Most people who find things offensive in a library are always looking at the bad side of the situation. There is always a good side to every situation. With a good and positive attitude, you should see the brighter side of things. Most magazines that you read, @PERCENT1 of it is talking about celebrities, so that really shouldn't have anything to do with you unless you're so in love with that celebrity and just have to say something about it. Other than that, it's none of your concern. Music is a way of expressing oneself in their own way. A person shouldn't feel offended because a song writer wants to express him or herself. What if that's the only way they know how to express themselves? It's like you're saying I don't want them to express themselves because it offends me. What if somebody didn't like the way you express yourself and wanted you to stop? I'm pretty sure you wouldn't like that. In my conclusion, I feel nothing should be removed from the library because it is offensive to someone. Certain things are put there for certain people. Nobody likes the same thing. How I see it, if it offends somebody, oh well, it wasn't put there to offend you on purpose. Each person has the freedom to choose what they want to engage with in the library, and removing materials based on individual offense would limit that freedom and the diverse range of content available.
1508	4485	2	3	Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the shelf and wondered why is this here, it's not a good thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to. I think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our library to better our community for our kids and their kids. We have all the right to voice our opinion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our library. Books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which aren't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch, should be removed from our library shelf. Have you ever noticed how our crime rate and drug rate has gone up in the past few years? These types of promotions are in some of our books, videos, and other media. If we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kind of behavior, we would have less of this type of crimes going on. I don't believe we would have all this crime going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or TV show or even in a book, so we follow what they do. If they promote crime, you try to act like them. We as humans follow the actions of others whether we think about it or not. Music also plays a big role in this too. Music containing bad language or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people has been proven to play with our minds. Would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, killing people, and other things that we shouldn't do? There's music we all like out there. We listen to what we like, so that being said, if we like rap for example, if it promotes killing, we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's okay since you like rap music. We @CAPS1's in our community believe that we should abstain ourselves from this kind of behavior, and we don't see too many drugs, killings, or sexual activity. The Bible teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activity. Thus, we don't see much of these behaviors in a @CAPS2 home or community. @CAPS4 are better off than lots of us whether we want to accept that or not. They live a life after @CAPS3, which doesn't promote all these behaviors. And I know that @CAPS4 would be more willing to take out these types of media in our library. You can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of @CAPS4 and how they act. They don't act like normal people as far as being involved in drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain themselves from media that promotes sex, drugs, killing, and other harmful things. Now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our library that promotes sex, drugs, and killing. I don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lives because you didn't help in removing this media. Please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the generations to come after us. By taking proactive steps to remove such harmful media, we can create a safer and more positive environment for the younger generation to grow and thrive.
1509	4486	2	3	Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? No, I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. A library should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies. One reason I think that a library should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing. For example, some kids could love to read scary and gory books, and others could like to read books about sports or love stories. So maybe the kids that read sports books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the library because some kids like to read gory books. Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc., is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things. People would get bored if their library only had books about war. Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories. Also, if your library has all different kinds of magazines, kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. So if you only had four magazines about the same thing, kids wouldn't discover any more cool facts. A library is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things. So I think if you started taking specific things out of the library, then I think kids would stop coming to the library. A library contains awesome information that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out, then not that many kids will come to the library because they will not be learning @CAPS1 new. So if I had any say in this, I would keep all things in the library. I would not remove @CAPS1! You want people to come to your library, so you don't want to do @CAPS1 that can jeopardize people coming to your library. I think if you start removing things, then you're going to have less and less people come in, and eventually maybe your library will get shut down because you have no business. So leave everything on the shelves. By maintaining a diverse collection, libraries can continue to attract visitors and fulfill their role as a valuable resource for learning and exploration.
1510	4487	2	3	There are a lot of things to life, and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get. Sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it. Because when people feel lost, it's the most scared thing to a person. So they turn to reading books, listening to music, watching movies, also looking and reading magazines. But although that's not the best way you can go, there are times when you need to listen to your soul the most. Now there was a time when no one knew how to read or even was allowed to read. But nowadays, reading has taken over. If you can read, you can do anything. You could be the one to run the whole world one day if you read things right. Books and magazines, there isn't a big difference between the two. Books can take your mind off to somewhere that you have never seen before, like places in the wild, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1's, and high up in trees. It teaches you @LOCATION1 thing, but not everything it teaches is good. Books can lie about what's about to happen to the world. Now magazines show you what all the stars are doing, how they're living, what their house looks like, and their money and their home. There's one thing you have to understand. You can't always get scared and think what you're reading is right. You have to read your mind to see what it says about what you just read. When you hear your favorite song, what do you do? Or when you see your favorite movie? Do you start dancing or do you cry when they break up? Do you say I can sing like her or do you re - enact the part in the movie? These things can help you or make you think about things you shouldn't do to people or even to yourself. Music can make you think about what your life has been through or miss the person that has died because they listened to that one song so much. Music can talk you into killing yourself, drive you crazy, hurt your soul when you hear what someone else has been through. It's all about how you take the song when you first hear it and take the messages out of it. Movies show history and show you what happens to people when they do the wrong things. There could be a icon in the movie you're watching and you could want to be like him/her. But not everyone you see you shouldn't want to be like them. You have to be yourself at the end of the day. Because you wake up looking at yourself every day, love yourself every day, and take care of yourself every day. When it's all said and done, you have to believe in yourself and not listen to what everyone is trying to tell you. Go with your soul. Yes, listen to it, read, or even watch, but just remember to follow your dreams and do what you love. So that's what I think about music, books, movies, and magazines. Listen but don't blindly follow. Trust your inner self to make the right judgments and stay true to your own
1511	4488	2	3	I think that movies, and magazines should be censured for kids at the library. There are many reasons these things should be censured, and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured. I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be accessible to kids. The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @CAPS1 are not only not supposed to be rented by children, but it's wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean, if there is a sex scene or something and the child is only like eight years old, this would be extremely awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. I mean, if you were a parent, would you want to explain to your eight - year - old what sex is? The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines. I know three in particular off the top of my head, and they are @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't think any kid, teenagers included, should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick, and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die. Well, this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids' ears and eyes. I mean, there are romances, but I don't think any kid is going to last through a whole romance because they are pretty boring. In conclusion, censuring movies and inappropriate magazines at the library is a necessary step to protect kids from content that is not suitable for their age.
1512	4489	2	3	In libraries, there are some books, music, and magazines that are not very appropriate to put on the shelves. There are little kids who will want to look at anything they can get their hands on. They are very curious when it comes to exploring new things. There are bad books, but there are also good books in the library. If people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf. There are children who look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting. The library also should at least carefully check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. That way, no one would have to worry about a material being offensive. Movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies, but I don't think that people would find them offensive. They don't have to watch it, and neither do their children. There is a lot of bad music. I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs, alcohol, and violence. People would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see. I have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropriate for underage children. I would get mad too because I don't want an underage child to be listening to that type of music. Children now look up to these songwriters and want to become them. That is not a good thing at all. All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is. Libraries would not put an inappropriate magazine on the shelves. There are some magazines that they have, but they are good magazines even for children to read. I think that the libraries don't put offensive magazines out because they don't want any controversy. People today have come out with even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropriate for anyone. In conclusion, implementing censorship on offensive books, music, and magazines in libraries is a wise move to safeguard children from unsuitable content and avoid potential controversies.
1513	4490	2	3	Censorship can be considered as a major problem. I firmly believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion that affects what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch. Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend. Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong. First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone. I don't believe that the issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today. So, in any other case, censorship would be wrong and immoral. Second, it shouldn't be someone else's opinion that determines whether anything is censored. My opinion may differ from another person's, and their opinion may be way different from someone else's. If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves. Others may find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting. Lastly, censorship is a communist trend. Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy. So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race. In conclusion, censorship is an unjust practice that violates our rights, goes against the democratic principles of our government, and is unfeasible due to the wide variation in people's opinions on what should be censored. It should not be allowed anywhere.
1514	4491	2	3	Throughout history, there have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could be invalidated through the clearly - spoken text. However, this is not the @DATE1. Women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not diluted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So, is it the library's fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents' fault for not educating their children on the morality of such items? The modern library has very specific demographics for all items it possesses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and the prior two media sources attract younger children. So, how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read, watch, or hear them. Plus, libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4. Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teen's mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti - semitic teen with a bad view on racism. So, then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents. In conclusion, instead of blaming the library for providing uncensored content, parents should take the responsibility of educating their children. And those who appreciate the diverse content a library offers should stand against the injustice of censorship towards authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and themselves.
1515	4492	2	3	Everywhere we go, there is censorship. Children hear their parents saying certain things and are more than likely to repeat them. Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do. It should be up to the children what they read, within reasonable limits. Books should be censored if they are made for children. Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like. Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also. We can learn something from anything we read. There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can. When uncensored things are said aloud, children are often excited. If they read themselves, they would learn a lot more. If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life. It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies. Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see. The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent. I always think it is a bad idea to have derogatory pictures on magazines. These photos may give children negative thoughts, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model. Children remember almost everything they hear/see. In conclusion, while some level of censorship for children's content is reasonable, ultimately, parents should have the main say in what their children are exposed to, and children should have the opportunity to learn from a variety of materials in a responsible way.
1516	4493	2	3	@CAPS1 day @CAPS4 @CAPS3, my dad was pulled over three times for @CAPS2, which is quite an unusual and frustrating situation: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. '@CAPS6' is just one of several quotes from a book that I am reading that some people could take offense to. The book in general is a rather appeasing book, but it's just some of the things in it that people might take offense to. That doesn't mean the book shouldn't belong on shelves. I don't think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone. That's like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life; you would be left with nothing in the end. If someone finds the things that other people have to say offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive. Some magazines have really offensive things in them, things that people in the real world say. It's not like your generic non - fiction books that come up with insulting things to say at a high school level. You don't have to subscribe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read. These days, so many things offend so many people in so many different ways. What might offend @PERSON1 down the street, @PERSON2 across town might find funny. You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shelf because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyone's wants and needs. I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books about age limits. Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as 'young adult' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it's alright for you to read those types of books. It'd be just like movies; movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books? I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves and out of the market just because someone cried foul against it. If they don't like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no @CAPS1 is forcing them to pay attention to it. They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offensive. Once again I say, taking a book off the shelf every time someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime; you'd be left with nothing. In conclusion, we should respect different opinions and use reasonable ways like age - restrictions instead of hasty removal.
1517	4494	2	3	Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books; they keep me on the edge of my seat. However, some that I have read might not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea. People don't always read books or watch movies just because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library these days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a school project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea. As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that might be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me. For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interested in. So let's keep everyone in mind and their different interests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library. In conclusion, we should preserve the diversity of library resources to meet different people's needs.
1518	4495	2	3	In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries. Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better - off have. If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazine/newspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive. The right to free speech is an important one in the @LOCATION1. Here, we can have opinions, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed. Writing is a form of expression. Writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who does one think they are to say it's offensive? Who gets to decide that this book or movie is offensive? If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people might find the @CAPS2 offensive, but we still put that in libraries. Some people might find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all the rage now, and we wouldn't take those away. Things that people find offensive are just opinions, just like the ones of those of the writers. It just simply wouldn't work out. If you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that might be 'offensive'. In conclusion, we should uphold the principle of free speech and allow diverse literary works in libraries.
1519	4496	2	3	There are many different kinds of books in the library. Not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there. I think that libraries should censor the books, movies, and magazines so that either they are in a certain room where only adults can see or get them, or they are not in the library at all. The books in the libraries can have some very obscene items in them that young children should not be able to see. I have been to the library many times, whether it be by myself or with others. I know what is out there, and some of the books or movies are not always kid - rated. I would like to someday be able to take my own child into the library knowing that what they are going to see is okay for their eyes. Magazines are always talking about new relationships or this person is having a baby or anything along those lines, and I don't want my child seeing that. The library I usually go to has the magazines out where everyone can view them, and I don't want this for my son or daughter who is of a young age. I think a parent should be able to take their children into a library knowing that when their child runs up to them with a book, it will be something that they are allowed to read or get and not something that an adult would read. Libraries could always make a separate room for books and movies that are not always for children. Such as the rated @CAPS1 movies or books that are inappropriate for young children. That way when a little kid is running around looking for a new book to read, they can't see or pick up these books or movies. I don't know about the other adults or parents out there, but I sure don't want my little kid walking around talking about an inappropriate book or movie they saw at the library. Since libraries have many different kinds of magazines, books, and movies, it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around. Libraries could always make a separate room for items like this, for the books that are for older @ORGANIZATION1, movies that are rated @CAPS1, or magazines such as @ORGANIZATION1. I think that if libraries did this, parents would be much more at ease to taking their children and letting them run around and look for new and interesting books to read or movies to watch. In conclusion, creating separate areas for age - appropriate materials in libraries can provide a safer and more suitable environment for children.
1520	4497	2	3	There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because something is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is that if there's something that someone doesn't want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove something that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch. First, why I think censorship is wrong is that the people that take offense to what they want removed don't have to look at what's offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it. Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that person's first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it, not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child and the whole community. Lastly, let's say that in a library, there's at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library. That's what I think about censorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them. In conclusion, censorship undermines the diversity and accessibility of library resources and should be avoided.
1521	4498	2	3	Have you ever read or listened to something that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published? Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and inappropriate thoughts that children listen to and base their lives off of. All of these resources that kids can find that have this kind of material in them can be easily found in libraries. We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources.  A library has the tendency to be known as a boring or a very plain place. If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it. They find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library. Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out. Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'. So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book. This leads to disaster.  Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded in the past ten years often picks up sexual references, drug usage, and inappropriate behavior in its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in their masterpiece? Well, singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies. So, every artist of any kind of work is putting these references in their books or songs. Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not only sing these lyrics but show them as well. Children see these artists in these videos with attractive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'. So, this person tries doing the same thing this artist did to make their life more like theirs.  Movies come along then. Movies have seen the ratings go up on these kinds of styles, so they start putting them in their films. Now, all these pieces have this garbage in them and have had it in them for quite some time. How do we get it out? How do we get our children to stop getting these resources? No parents want to walk around and hear their children saying these things or doing these actions. So libraries have to have some censorship on their work; their work should be removed so minors won't get the wrong message.  What ever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as something that would get our children into some trouble? We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are. We must take action to protect our children from the negative influences that are so prevalent in modern media and library resources.
1522	4499	2	3	I was asked the question 'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' I would have to say no. I don't think you should be in the library to be criticizing what other people believe in. But what if you just come across a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive? Just ignore it.  I don't think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time. Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and don't bother looking at it. Everything can be offensive to anyone. @PERSON2 was completely right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...Then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think in this day and age every kid knows more than they're supposed to anyway, so why censor what they already know?  What if you might like this specific series and it is about the Holocaust and it is like many different stories made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but you're not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and gets it taken off the shelves cause it's offensive. Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5. If that had happened to you what would you do? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series? Many people find things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't.  People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right. If you're one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than getting upset because of stupid petty stuff. In music, there are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a different race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being racist. It's not being racist, offensive, or directed towards you! So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining.  Now, Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some, I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading. There are selected magazines and movies out there on the shelves of public libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out?  I personally don't think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere. Taking books off shelves is like telling people to stop reading. We should respect the diversity of ideas and let readers make their own choices.
1523	4500	2	3	They have a book in the library called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. If you ever read @CAPS3, you might cry. When they have @CAPS3 in the basement, they have him eat off the floor, eat his brother's throw - up, and even eat worms. They beat him and he has bruises all over his body. His dad broke his arm in two because his dad and mom were fighting so much that his brothers couldn't take @CAPS3's situation anymore. So, his brother called the cops and the cops came and they all left that terrible place.  Two years later, him and his brother got adopted. Their new mom and dad were good to them. Even though they had six brothers and five sisters, they all got along and they had a good life after their real mom and dad died. This shows that even after going through such a horrible situation, there can be hope for a better future.
1524	4501	2	3	When someone goes to the library, there is a multitude of items to choose from. There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc. But not all of this is necessarily a good thing. There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience. The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for the sake of children.  Although there is much good material in a library, there is also bad or offensive material in a library as well. For example, an explicit music album. If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for a while. By removing the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want their children listening to anyway.  Movies are also a problem in libraries. For example, libraries having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch. Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child - appropriate. Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the inappropriate material in the movie. This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch. So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in libraries, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior.  Books are the same way as movies and music. There are books on the shelves that some people consider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book. There are books made that include racial material in them, even derogatory statements. By taking these types of books off the shelves of libraries, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur.  For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in libraries should be removed. If libraries would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all libraries a more healthy and stable environment for studying like it used to be used for. Take out all the offensive material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc., creating a more positive and suitable space for all library visitors.
1525	4502	2	3	What is offensive in libraries? The offenses in libraries are inappropriate and non - censored books, music, magazines, movies, and other materials in libraries. These books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves. They should not be removed because the authors of the books are just writing.  From my own experience, I have seen inappropriate movies. To me, I feel that they teach me some lessons, but it also depends on what type of movie it is. If it is rated @CAPS1 then I know that I may see some blood, gory scenes, and nudity. If this type of movie is not @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then I know that some of this stuff on the screen may happen in real life. Most likely not happen, but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world. All of this teaches me to be more careful about what I am doing and where I am doing it at.  In libraries, there should not be nudity websites, books, or magazines or anything like that because that is just stupid and inappropriate for any child to see, especially in a public library. Now if a gory movie or a book with lots of blood in it, then it should stay on the shelves. I say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing.  So, as I ask again, what might be offensive in libraries? Some might say that books, magazines, movies etc. with racial slurs are offensive; but to others, it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be. In my perspective, I just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and let the creativeness take over. That might be it, it might not.  In so many words, I say that the 'offensive' books, magazines, music, movies and other materials should stay on the shelf. For so many reasons I have said, and the ones I have not said, they help people learn. By keeping these materials, we allow for a more diverse and educational library environment where people can gain different perspectives and learn from the world's realities.
1526	4503	2	3	Should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment? Of course they should. Libraries have all kinds of people, including children, teenagers, and adults, walking in and out every day. Certain rated material, such as books with explicit content or movies with mature themes, should be put in certain spots for certain people. The library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day - to - day basis. Libraries need to become a little more organized.  Libraries have people that come in and out of the library every day. People of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library. With that being said, children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material. Children of course can't read everything in the library. They have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection. So if the library is more censored and strict about the material, children can't get their hands on the material that they shouldn't be seeing at that time in their lives. You wouldn't want your seven - year - old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material, right?  Libraries should put the material that is for adults' eyes only in one completely different section of the library than what they would want the children that come to the library to see. With doing that, it decreases the chances of the children getting a hold of material that they shouldn't see. Also, some books that the library thinks that some children should be able to see just might be offensive to another set of people and wouldn't want their children to see. So books that show racism, or maybe another kind of discrimination, and it might not be the goal of the book to make that suggestion but it still is in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some children's minds.  The libraries really need to just stop and think for a second: is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment? Libraries have become where children are just checking out books by themselves and to me that's a problem. I think that children need a parent's consent to check out a book from a library but do the libraries care? No. Library staff should check their inventory and notice a book might be missing but guess what, by that time it's already too late. Children are able to just walk right out with books these days and no one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out. When children find a piece of material in a library and they know they aren't supposed to have it and they know they can't get out of the library with it, they might decide to just take the book. The security won't think twice to check the child and what is the result? The child's mind is corrupted. Guess what, you can blame it on the library. Isn't that something, the child got the material from your friendly neighborhood library.  Organization is the key. Libraries need to organize their material better, plain and simple. It's really not that hard. They need to review the content that they're putting on the shelves in their establishment. I feel that the people at the library are lazy personally. If they just gave a little more effort, maybe the children wouldn't get their hands on material that they have no business getting a hold of. Just pay attention to what's going on in the library. There are books everywhere, right? There are children, correct. The children should be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident. Though it was an accident, it still happened and it can be prevented and it should be prevented for the sake of the children. All we need is a little more organization.  As you can see from the following, libraries just don't care about our children as much as we do. It's okay that everyone is welcome in the library no questions asked, but the people need to stay in the designated place in the library. Children shouldn't be allowed in the adult section for safety. Also, a book from the adult side shouldn't be in the children's section because anything can happen and corruption will rise. We need stricter libraries. Better security to monitor what the children are looking at and where the material is. Also, the library really needs to look at the material and decide if it is appropriate for all the readers that might look at the material. Organization is the key to all our worries. If we use a bit more effort, this won't be a problem anymore.
1527	4504	2	3	Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some. In a culture like the one we have today, censorship usually takes the back seat. The media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad. People have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides. Every person is entitled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries.  There are many things in libraries today that portray bad images and contain questionable content. Books and movies have things in them that indeed children shouldn't view, but the library is not able to take them down. People enjoy seeing and hearing these things. That's why Hollywood comes out with more rated R movies than all the other ratings combined. They make the most money off of them. In today's economy, the library needs to keep these things on their shelf so that they can stay in business. If people are offended by it, then stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie. If someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive, then they are breaking the freedom that this country has. Censorship is an opinion - based topic that one cannot make on their own.  As one can see, the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion. It is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want. Books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like. Parents should modify what their children watch, but as an adult they are able to watch or read anything that they want to. In conclusion, the library should maintain its role of providing diverse content while parents take on the responsibility of guiding their children's media consumption.
1528	4505	2	3	Hey my name is [PERSON1] and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or even see. They should at least put them in a separate part of the library.  I had an experience like this once. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me. I didn't want to take him but I couldn't say no to him. He quickly got his shoes on and he ran to the door. He was so excited, jumping up and down in anticipation. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors. I chased after him. When I caught him, I firmly told him that he couldn't run away from me like that.  We went inside. It was a giant library with rows and rows of bookshelves. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting. I got it and started to read it. Then he ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book. He handed it to me and I just lost it. The book was not a children's book at all. It was one of the worst books that I have ever seen. There were inappropriate images and vulgar language. We left the library and never came back.  I think that books that are bad for children should be in their own section in the library. This section should be for grown - ups only and that no children are allowed in there. This is what I think should be done to all libraries. By doing so, it can protect children from being exposed to inappropriate content and ensure that libraries remain a safe and suitable place for all ages.
1529	4506	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years. In many school libraries, certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed because of the content in them. These items can be removed for these common types of content which include, the use of violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inappropriate language. Many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school. Most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age, because it could influence them to participate in these activities.  In my opinion, I do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups. In elementary and middle school libraries, items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inappropriate or violent in any way. In a school environment, kids should only be introduced to drug use, and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts and it would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex, and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie.  Many kids watch movies that have very violent, and inappropriate scenes, and some of the songs in the world today are extremely inappropriate for young kids. There are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them. This is why I do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing. By implementing proper censorship in school libraries, we can create a healthier and more appropriate learning environment for young students.
1530	4507	2	3	WE ALL DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES. But on the other hand, WE DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILDREN GETTING HOLD OF THE CENSORSHIP OF BAD BOOKS, MOVIES, MUSIC OR MAGAZINES. Parents don't want to come home and find their child has learned a new bad word from the new book or movie he/she just checked out from the library, or from reading a magazine from the library. It might make your children's attitude change, putting a bad influence on your kid because of a trip to the library.  So therefore, the children should have a section where they pick out their books and they shouldn't be able to check out the censored books. The library should clearly mark and separate the age - appropriate materials. This way, children are less likely to access inappropriate content.  We need to make sure our children are more convinced about this topic. Parents should talk to their children about why certain materials are off - limits. By working together, we can ensure that libraries remain a safe and beneficial place for children to explore and learn.
1531	4508	2	3	I believe that everyone has their own opinion in what they listen to, what they watch, and what they read. I believe that some stuff can change our world. It can't be removed just because of people's offense because if people had their way about what's offensive, there would be nothing left to sell. After all, everything is offensive to at least one person.   I think we need to get rid of things that might lead weak - minded people to take harmful actions. When they see certain content and it stays in their minds, they might act it out in real life, getting themselves into trouble.   I think that we have the power to change what we see or hear and, in turn, change the world. This kind of change is what the world needs, making improvements in areas we couldn't even think of before. In conclusion, respecting individual opinions while being cautious about harmful content is the key to a better world.
1532	4509	2	3	I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are under censorship can learn a great deal from them. These materials often contain complex themes and real - life situations that can broaden students' perspectives. Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropriate at school, then why are they here in the first place?   Movies that are not allowed because of their rating, I think, is rather unreasonable. Sure, they might have pictures of naked people and bad language, but we are high school students. We are mature enough to understand that these are part of the story's context and that they are educational. We can learn about different cultures, social issues, and human nature from such movies.   Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a double - edged sword, having both good and bad aspects. But overall, I think it should be allowed.   Therefore, books or movies that are censored shouldn't be. I personally think that students learn better from recent rated R movies than some old - fashioned movies that are in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good, interesting movies, while most students fall asleep or don't pay attention at all during old movies. So, after considering all these, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.   If books and movies are so bad, then why would they even be present in the school? I think it's foolish for teachers or administrators to think that we are too immature to watch rated R movies. I believe that every kid at school watches them at home. Yeah, I know some movies show scenes that aren't school - related, but we'll get over it.   Overall, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. Well, then, the last point is that all these aspects actually help us in a way if you really think about it. For example, get a classroom with computers. For one week, let the students listen to music while they work, and for another week, don't let them listen to anything. Then see which week the work quality is better. Personally, listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on track to get my work done.   So, you've got my opinion on censorship, and I hope it helps you look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated R movies should be allowed at high schools, and any music should be too. I mean, it's not like we are in prison, right? So, there you have my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools. In conclusion, allowing a certain degree of uncensored materials in high school can contribute to students' growth and learning.
1533	4510	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Some say there should be, some do not. Cultural books and magazines could be offensive to some readers. The cultural expressions and values presented in them might clash with the beliefs of certain individuals. History in books can sometimes even be offensive depending on someone's lifestyle or background.   Are you wrong if you say you want censorship in the library? No, you are not wrong because there are many people who think that some books should be taken off of the shelves of their local libraries. Some of their reasons are that parents have young children and they do not want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable. However, others say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk. Meaning that if someone goes to the library looking for a certain book and they pick up one they find as offensive, it could be a good book for someone else.   Do all books that are considered 'offensive' have to be fiction? No, not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive. This does not mean that there aren't books out there like that. Cultural books or magazines from other countries or of a certain topic can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages. Everywhere in the world, no matter where you are, there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you. Everybody has their own opinion on the matter. The cultural materials in the library are just showing how the people of other countries live and act. It is not opinions or false claims in these materials, only fact. So cultural materials should not be censored, although it could have a section just for that type of material.   History books can be one of those materials that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in. Religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion. Some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion. Race and origin are another problem with some people. History books and elder's stories can always somehow be mixed and could cause trouble. For example, if a World War II veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area, the history book could tell a completely different story. History books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived.   My views on the censorship of libraries is that there should not be any of it. Maybe the library could make a section for what people might think is 'offensive.' Materials or books should definitely not be taken off of the shelves though, because one man's offense is another man's great read. In conclusion, a balanced approach with sections for potentially offensive materials is the best way to handle library content.
1534	4511	2	3	Today, millions of teens are constantly bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or even commercials. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population from topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. However, is that really the right choice?   In life, we cannot simply shut our eyes and pretend that there are no harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equipped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question: is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? When one conceals information, that person is essentially stealing the right of knowledge. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive, another might not. This topic is just too abstract to be regulated. For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us.   Therefore, censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in. By restricting access to books, we are preventing students from exploring different ideas, cultures, and perspectives. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place of free access to knowledge, with maybe some guidance but no strict censorship.
1535	4512	2	3	I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad. I think that there are different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required.   In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought and used in the library. Given that elementary kids are not as mature as adults or high - school students, their level of reading is not as advanced. Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and any violence. This is because reading these books might put inappropriate ideas into their heads. It might teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they might think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book.   On the other hand, high - schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books. I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present. While most guys are into violent books about shooting or football books, a lot of girls are interested in the romance type of books, which possibly express more than what most elementary kids should know. In high schools, there should be less censorship due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in.   In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries do have already. This way, parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them. Everyone is obligated to their own choices. Whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive is up to them.   All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive because books are a type of outlet to people. They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied. Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please. On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to and to keep all of their parents happy. In conclusion, a balanced approach of categorization rather than complete removal is the ideal way to handle book censorship in libraries.
1536	4513	2	3	In our great nation, we enjoy numerous freedoms. One of these precious liberties is the freedom to read, hear, and see whatever we desire. Each of us holds distinct views that align with this freedom, whether it's the TV shows we watch, the books we read in our leisure time, or the music we love to listen to. However, if we were granted the right to remove things we dislike, we would surely ruin the enjoyment for others. This would ultimately erode our freedom. Many authors, musicians, and directors have emphasized that this freedom is essential for leading an enjoyable and creative life.  We, as individuals, have diverse perspectives on a multitude of matters. Fortunately, our freedoms allow us to hold these views without interfering with the views or ideas of others. If we were to remove books, movies, magazines, etc., there would be nothing left for anyone. Our libraries would be emptied, classrooms would lack books, and stores would have nothing to offer. We should not possess the right to remove what we deem inappropriate or what doesn't conform to our values or interests.  Even though the idea of removing things might seem appealing, we must consider the thoughts and ideas of others. Take a public library, for example. It houses books for children, teens, and adults, each with their own individual preferences. Similarly, a school library has books tailored to the preferences of children and teens. If we allow this right, these libraries that celebrate individuality would cease to exist. People would be unable to exercise their freedom of individuality. Everyone should be allowed to be themselves.  Imagine if we extended this right to the foods we purchase. We all have different food preferences; some foods delight us, while others repel us. The foods we choose are akin to the books we read; there are those we favor and others we avoid. No one would have any food to eat at restaurants, schools, or even at home. It would turn into a complete disaster.  We should not have this right because it would be unfair to everyone. Our views may differ, but we share similar needs. The freedom we have is a freedom of choice. If we find a particular book, movie, or magazine inappropriate, we should allow others the opportunity to pick it up and see if it aligns with their values and interests. Others will do the same. After all, isn't individuality and choice what makes our freedoms so valuable?
1537	4514	2	3	Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can spark a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our ability to learn or see things from a different perspective?  First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It's entirely possible for anything to offend someone. Moreover, removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writer and the writer's followers. Bringing up the idea of removing a book from shelves could create more problems than simply leaving the book on the shelves. If offending others is the concern, wouldn't it be better to leave the book alone rather than making it an issue to please one group while upsetting another?  Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your capacity to learn something or hear a different point of view? If books that offended people had always been removed, we wouldn't have much of the knowledge we possess today. For instance, a biology book might be offensive to those whose religion offers a different explanation of things, making certain scientific facts seem untrue. Conversely, a religious document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to those who believe biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would lose both religion and modern science. This example can be applied to any topic or genre of book because people can find many things offensive.  As a solution, I firmly believe that it's impossible to please everyone. If one person is satisfied, another is offended. If that person is satisfied, the first person is offended. If books could be labeled as'some might find offensive' or 'this material may be offensive', people would be warned and could choose whether they want to read it or not. If they are offended, they can't blame the author or the place where they got the book because there was a warning. It would be similar to the parental warnings on CDs. This may not solve the problem of people being offended, but it could significantly reduce the number of complaints about a book being offensive.  In conclusion, books should remain on the shelves regardless of people's complaints about them being offensive. Removing books from shelves could lead to all books being removed, which would mean no education or learning. That's simply not an option. Leaving books on the shelves may cause controversy, but if appropriate warnings are in place and the proper procedures are followed, the issues can be greatly reduced. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves.
1538	4515	2	3	I agree with Katherine's statement, but only to a certain extent. If a book or magazine contains cursing or anything offensive, a student should take it to the librarian and inform them that they are offended by it. This is especially important in middle schools or elementary schools.  Of course, there will always be books, movies, or magazines that contain inappropriate content. One day, my friend and I were in the library searching for a book to read when I first discovered the @CAPS1 series. As I delved deeper into the books, I noticed that they became more mature. The last book, @ORGANIZATION1, is filled with a lot of profanity. However, this doesn't mean that I'm not mature enough to understand what it means. The same goes for any other high school student. You can't shield your children from everything, not even curse words.  So, if you come across a book at a local library that is full of offensive material and you decide that you want it removed, simply take it to the librarian and confront them. I'm sure they'll understand. Or perhaps they won't and will wait to see if anyone else wants it removed. My point is, you can't always protect your children from violent words, movies, or magazines. But you can always stand your ground and make an effort.  In the end, while it's understandable to be concerned about offensive content, completely removing books may not be the best solution. By communicating with the librarian and allowing them to make an informed decision, we can strike a balance between protecting children and maintaining the freedom to access a wide range of literature.
1539	4516	2	3	What impact do books intended for mature audiences have on kids? Recently, people have been trying to censor libraries based on what they've observed their kids reading or how they've been behaving. I disagree with the idea of censoring libraries. Instead of censoring libraries, perhaps we could create a section for explicit books or implement measures to prevent young kids from reading them.  First of all, instead of removing all the books, we should consider creating a section exclusively for people of a certain age. We could set up this section at the back of the library and require @CAPS1 to verify that the readers are old enough. This way, the library can keep all its books, satisfy all its customers, and most importantly, keep the parents happy.  Another reason for not censoring libraries is that the number of customers would gradually decline. This would make the customers unhappy and cause the library to lose its popularity as it wouldn't have the books that people want to read.  I can understand why some people are trying to censor libraries due to the behavior of kids. Censoring libraries would prevent young kids from imitating the behavior they see in books. However, it would be better not to censor libraries and keep the people who enjoy reading these books satisfied.  In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of censoring libraries because it would upset the readers and likely cause the library's popularity to decline, which means fewer people would visit the library. So, those who oppose censorship should take action now to ensure that libraries remain as they are.
1540	4517	2	3	The @CAPS1 on Books In today's world, we are exposed to everything everywhere we look. Libraries are frequented by many people. People visit libraries to conduct research, study, or simply find an interesting book to read. One of the issues some people are facing is the exposure of personal content. I believe that libraries should implement censorship. Why should libraries have censorship? Here are my reasons.  One reason why censorship in libraries is a wise idea is that younger children use libraries to search for books. Any parent would strongly oppose the idea of their child reading something overly detailed and adult-oriented. A library should be a place where children, young adults, and senior citizens can escape from reality, not a place where they have to worry about what book they might pull off the shelf.  If libraries still want to keep certain books in their collection, they should impose an age limit on those books. Limiting the age for accessing these books will prevent younger audiences from viewing them. Additionally, parents could work with the library to set an age limit for their child to access certain books.  Another way to prevent offensive content from being viewed is for parents to monitor what their children are reading, watching, and listening to. Parents can play an active role in keeping an eye on their child's activities.  Censorship is an excellent way to prevent the viewing of adult-oriented issues. More public places should adopt a censorship system. The world needs to recognize that some audiences are not ready to face reality just yet.  In conclusion, implementing censorship in libraries can help create a more suitable environment for all users. By setting age limits and having parents actively involved, we can strike a balance between providing access to information and protecting younger audiences from inappropriate content.
1541	4518	2	3	"Libraries across the world contain all kinds of books, some good and some bad. There's always going to be something in a book that might offend the reader or someone close to the reader. It just depends on how sensitive people are. The main reasons people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries are because of racial slurs, religion, and sexual content. I think it should be the libraries' choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down. Magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music. According to some, libraries are just filled with vulgar, racial, or inappropriate movies, books, etc. If the parents are scared of their children being able to rent these things, they need to put some sort of block on them. If you want to rent ""bad"" things, you should have to have parental permission. Taking all of these things out of the library is not a solution. All it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more. The library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids won't be able to get the ""bad"" books in their hands. A lot of the books in libraries have meaning even if the book uses foul language or hate, etc. It shows the mood of the story or how the character really feels inside. If stories like ""To Kill in The Mockingbird"" didn't have anger, emotion, or the passion it has, it would be a boring book. Authors put language, sexual content, and violence in books, movies, and magazines to entertain certain crowds. If you take these things away, certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things they could possibly read. In conclusion, a balanced approach is needed to handle potentially offensive materials in libraries, respecting both the rights of readers and the need for appropriate content access."
1542	4519	2	3	"Imagine a day where there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminiscing of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive. Everyone's ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply. Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. Just don't read it! By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best. A woman could be offended by a fashion magazine in the library because it simply has an advertisement for a body wash. She might say something like ""My child shouldn't see things like this,"" then demand it be taken out of the library. Does that make sense? I didn't think so either. In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power. Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily! Now, that's only on a small scale. Imagine if they actually took this up with higher authorities. That book would be taken away from all schools in the area. This brings us to this problem. Should we, as people, as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read? The answer to that is a definite no. Let's look on the other end of this now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned? As an example, I'll use J.K. Rowling. What would happen to her if the series ""Harry Potter"" were banned from schools? Also, what about the kids that like to read? This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it. That librarian from the beginning is leaving now. There's no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore. The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper. This shouldn't happen. Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of reading materials and not let individual sensitivities lead to widespread censorship."
1543	4520	2	3	Censorship          Should certain materials (books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is. If it is something very provocative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it, then it shouldn't be allowed. Or, the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to. It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who have access to these materials. I don't think these materials should be removed, but restricted. Some of it should be left up to the school or library, but it is also a responsibility of the parents. If a child has permission to access a certain material, then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate. Sometimes the guardian's views might not be the same as the library or school's, but it's mostly up to the guardian. Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence. Overall, I don't think materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents, teachers and/or school board members, and/or library staff. Just because one mom thinks a book is inappropriate for her child, doesn't mean it should be banned from another. Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable, therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person. If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material, then simply don't let them access it. If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access, you can express that, but others might not agree. Materials considered inappropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them, but not a ban. In conclusion, a collaborative and balanced approach is needed to handle potentially offensive materials, considering the rights and responsibilities of all stakeholders.
1544	4521	2	3	If you found a movie that you really enjoyed at the library, would you get mad if the library just took it away and there was no other place to get it? If one person doesn't like something they see at the library, it doesn't mean it's not educational, and they shouldn't just get rid of it. Just because somebody doesn't like the one thing doesn't mean another person will. I don't think they should get rid of movies, music, books, or magazines just because of one person. Here are some things that will make you think about getting rid of all these categories. One thing about movies that I like is that they are good for visual aids. Some people are better learners if they visualize something; they can get a better understanding of the purpose or the cause of the situation and they might learn faster. Another thing about movies in the library is that they show you things in the movie that you wouldn't be able to see if you were just reading a book. One thing that I like personally is that when people are in movies, it's like you are actually talking to them, like me and the actor are really having a conversation. When you look at a movie, it gives you a visual picture of what's going on, even if the content isn't appropriate. That's all the reasons why I think that movies shouldn't be taken away because someone thinks that the movies are vulgar and not censored. Music is another thing that they shouldn't get rid of. Music is almost the only thing that can calm you down so that you can focus again. Another thing that music does to you is it soothes the mind so that you can relax and you won't bother anybody else. When you listen to music, it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from. So those are the reasons why music shouldn't be gotten rid of. Magazines and books are the basics of a library. If you get rid of those, then it wouldn't be a library anymore. Books are the basic learning methods of education. People learn the most information out of a book or magazine. If you take those away, it's like you're trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books. So if you get rid of magazines and books, then it wouldn't even be a library anymore. If you get rid of movies from the library, then people won't be able to have a visual aid as their alternative way of learning. If you get rid of music from the library, you won't be able to concentrate as well on one thing if you're constantly getting disturbed by other noise around you. Last but not least, if you get rid of books from the library, then it won't be a library anymore; it will just be a place to go like any other place. The library wouldn't be anything anymore. Now, would you want that? Thank you. In conclusion, libraries should preserve a diverse collection of movies, music, magazines, and books to support different learning styles and access to knowledge.
1545	4522	2	3	I'm a lot of things but I am surely not a reader. But I do believe that you should be able to publish anything that you want over any topic. Whether that be a graphic novel or a diary magazine. Nothing should be taken off the shelf for being offensive. If it offends you, don't pick it up or much less read it. Say I wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting. I would still be able to write it and sell it. Anything that anyone has a problem with, they try to ban or get rid of it. Instead, why don't they just get over it? We have rights. Every individual person from me to you, we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full extent of what they can be used for. Call me old - fashioned, but I believe in freedom of speech and the freedoms that we have lost soldiers over and the freedoms we have every single day we live. I think drinking every Friday of the week is wrong, but you don't see me on the news yelling about it. No, I deal with it just like people should deal with the things they don't like. So I hope in this essay I've made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not acting on something you shouldn't be able to change. Thank you for taking the time to read this. In conclusion, we should uphold the principles of freedom of expression and learn to tolerate different forms of content rather than seeking to censor them.
1546	4523	2	3	Libraries are filled with a vast array of books, magazines, music, movies, and numerous other materials. All of these materials span an incredibly wide range of topics. For instance, movies can fall into genres such as comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for certain viewers and can be highly offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries. One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can trigger violence in teenagers. If a teenager continuously reads books or watches movies that contain violence, they might start to think that violent behavior is acceptable. They might fail to understand that violence is not the solution to many problems and won't realize that there are alternative solutions. One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high - school. A straight - A student received a grade she believed she didn't deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school hours. She then proceeded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers managed to convince the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie, she would not have threatened to kill her teacher. Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might simply be looking through books and magazines in the library without even checking them out. In this way, no one will know that they have read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs. When a child reads this, they might be tempted to try everything described in the book. I have read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book could plant awful ideas in a child's head if they read it. After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it doesn't seem possible for that kind of behavior to emerge from that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people, and removing offensive materials is a necessary step to protect vulnerable groups.
1547	4524	2	3	Libraries have all kinds of books, catering to everyone's needs. I think libraries shouldn't have to take books out just because some people don't like it or find it offensive, while others might appreciate the author. If there is a book in the library that you find displeasing, simply don't check it out. Just put it back on the shelf and go on with your day. As author Katherine Paterson said, if we start taking books off the shelves, then there won't be any books left to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not meant for little kids and some adults, but that's why you don't let them check them out until you think they are old enough. Just because you don't like the book doesn't mean no one else does. Everyone has their own taste in reading, just as in everything else. Libraries have sections for all ages, with books appropriate for each age group. For example, the children's section is specifically for little kids, and the adult section is for adults. Little kids shouldn't be checking out books from the adult section. Parents should take responsibility for their kids and monitor what they're doing. Then we wouldn't have to worry about what they are reading, watching, or listening to. The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will continue to be so for years to come. So, no, libraries should not have to take certain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it or doesn't want their kid reading it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that suits your liking. People learn a great deal from books, so if we get rid of most of them, what will we learn from? Books are a great part of history. Why get rid of our history? It's simply wrong. Books should stay right where they are and belong, ensuring that everyone has access to a diverse range of reading materials.
1548	4525	2	3	Libraries have books that vary in length, from short to long, and everything in between. There are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader. There is no valid reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library, it should be removed from the shelf. The books on a library shelf are there for everyone to read. So, if one is removed, then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book. Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste good to you? No, you would simply not get it again. So, why should someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended? It isn't right. Your views on something are only an opinion, nothing more. Your views are not the same as @PERSON1's who lives down the street. So, by removing a book, you are pushing your views on someone else. In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it. Pushy people aren't normally liked by others. Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader. That is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf. We should respect the diversity of opinions and ensure that all books remain accessible for those who may want to read them.
1549	4526	2	3	Everyone in the world has an opinion. Some people @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive, but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem. I have only been to the library around @NUM1 times, and I generally rent movies. There are people who cannot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books, movies, and music. But at the same time, there are people who absolutely love it; it's their thing. I believe that it would be wrong to deprive those people of what they find interesting, what they enjoy to read, watch, and listen to. Some people will say that it's vulgar, while others will say that it's a masterpiece or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are too gory or have excessive sexual content in movies or magazines. However, they might have such content in books. Now, music nowadays can be downright vulgar and disrespectful. It can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang - related violence, which has become a large problem with our children. Libraries generally have old - school music like Michael Jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2 - Kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children listen to nowadays has all these depressing and violent morals that should not be shared with some of these young and impressionable minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelves, but I do believe that you should have to be a certain age to access these things. This way, both those who enjoy the content and those who are concerned about its impact can have their needs met.
1550	4527	2	3	Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally assume that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting on the shelves of our libraries nationwide, waiting for someone to open it up and engage with its naughty, intense, or graphic content. As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact a child? This child is not deliberately choosing to read such bad things but just happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? This raises the question: who is to blame, and what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries, but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to, right? It is a very tricky situation, and determining the answer should be a long and well - thought - out process that examines the issue from all angles and different perspectives. The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly about their views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day, I wanted to find something to do indoors. So, instead of staying home all day, I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and was quite familiar with their selection, so I was looking for something new. I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options readily available. I got tired of reading all the titles, so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting. Long story short, I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book that went into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say, I was shocked. Reading that stuff as a child scared me a great deal. Nevertheless, it leads me to believe that it would be wise for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact, hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So, I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a relatively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people who have not had such experiences or who have not stumbled upon such material, they would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child who happened to find and experience certain things they were not ready for, would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing for everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore instead of a public library. In conclusion, censoring libraries is a necessary measure to protect children from potentially harmful and inappropriate content, while still allowing adults access to a wide range of materials.
1551	4528	2	3	Every day, hundreds of people visit your local library. The library offers an array of things such as various types of books, different music genres, a wide selection of movies, numerous magazines, and a variety of newspapers. But what 'limits' does the library have about the content of those things? All sorts of people go to the library. I go to the library, you go to the library, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings - we all go to the library at one time in our life. Different crowds of people have different interests that, at times, offend others. The question is, should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries? Limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them. Truth is, someone, somewhere is going to take offense to the items in most libraries; you can never please everyone. Also, some of these topics could be used for educational purposes. Take anatomy books for example. While high school and college students use these books and detailed diagrams to study, some mothers may find them inappropriate for their young children to see. This is why libraries have separate sections for different audiences. There could be a children's section, a 'tween' section, and an adult section to help with this issue. Also, everyone has different interests. I, personally, can not stand rap music but my sister loves it. Even though I find some of the things they say in those songs offensive, it is my choice to listen to it or not. The song - writers, singers, publishers, and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so. Who are we to tell them they can't write about sex, drugs, or murder because, face it, those things are part of our day - to - day lives. If children aren't seeing these things in libraries, they will eventually come across them elsewhere. Should we remove 'offensive' material from libraries? No. If we do that there will be no books to read, no movies to watch, or music to listen to because everyone will take offense to something. In conclusion, maintaining a diverse collection in libraries respects freedom of expression and caters to the varied needs of the community.
1552	4529	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper @CAPS4, the article that you wrote last week really got to me. The one about whether you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. I went back and forth on this. First, I was thinking that if it was offensive to some people, then we should take it down because if it offends people, then why are we selling it to the people? But then I started thinking again, and I was like, people have the right to freedom of speech, and if this is how they want to talk, then let them speak their mind. This great country of ours was made on the right that every one is created equal and everyone is entitled to the freedom of speech. If people want to talk like they do in their music or act the way they want to in their movies, it's their life. If you don't like it, don't buy it or even pay any attention to it. Say if I was a rapper like Lil Wayne or someone like that, I would care about the people who are talking the way they are because it is my way of telling the world how I feel about things that are on my mind. If someone writes something in a book that you don't like, don't go all out and go on TV shows to make fun or tell how you feel. Write a letter to the author and tell them how you feel about the topic. Every person, black, white, yellow, brown, or even green, has the right to freedom of speech. It was given to us for a reason, and I think it was so that even if you have an idea but you think it is stupid, just say it because some people might think that it is amazing or not. But everyone is created the same, so treat people the way you want to be treated. I would like to thank you for reading this. Your article really opened my eyes to the world and how I should see it. Thank you for writing it. In conclusion, upholding freedom of speech in media and literature is essential for a democratic society.
1553	4530	2	3	I think that this kind of books may sometimes offend some people, and it depends on what kind or type of book, magazine, movie, or music. There are some things that are not bad for kids, like age - appropriate games or music, and others about animals, cultures, and all that. But the only thing I do not agree with is that there should not be books, music, magazines, or even movies that have sexual harassment - related content in libraries. I think that this type of stuff can be dangerous or offensive for some parents and people, whether they have kids or not. I also think that if they are in some libraries, we should take that off because we don't want kids to be disrespectful and learn things that are not in line with their education and age. I also disagree with the type of music that some artists are making, which is talking about drugs, gangs, and narcotrafficking, and even sex. I know this because sometimes I hear this on the @CAPS1 and radio when they are singing, and this influences kids to take a wrong direction in their life. As parents, we don't want that for our kids. We don't want that for their future. We want them to have a good future and be successful and give the same good example to their kids when they grow up and become parents. I have seen that in parts of the world, people are being killed or killing other innocent persons because of these things, more so for drugs. They are selling drugs and making money, and they are hurting other people or kids who consume these drugs, which maybe could be our kids or some friends' kids. Sometimes, if they don't pay the money they owe, they are killed, or the police are trying to find them because they are doing bad things. I hope that artists or people who put this kind of content in the libraries think first that maybe they are doing something wrong, even though they might think they are doing something good. In conclusion, it's crucial to filter out harmful content from libraries to protect the well - being and future of children.
1554	4531	2	3	Book Censorship. Censorship in libraries is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. The question is, 'Should we have an age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' These are very commonly asked questions, and they should have attention put toward them. In my opinion, books should have an age limit on them. My reasoning is because kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books suitable for their age group. There are plenty of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1 should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behavior from the character or artist. Another reason why libraries should have an age limit on things you can check out is because kids can get the wrong idea. Let's say, a book has a statement in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my best friend's house and drank alcohol.' This is something that a child should not be able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea about what they 'could' be doing. The age limits for book shelves should be as follows: @CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1 - @CAPS6. Implementing age limits for the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the constant worry of parents about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that having age - appropriate books in @CAPS2 age groups will stop the commotion. Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have an age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' will be answered. Age groups on books are a great idea. In conclusion, age - based book limits in libraries can safeguard children from inappropriate content and ease parental concerns.
1555	4532	2	3	There are books up and down the shelves in the library that often make people wonder why they are up there. People often stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves, 'Why in the world is this book here?' What many people often do not know is that every book is in the world for a reason. Books published are in the world to teach about history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take you on an adventure. Of course, you often come across a book that may be offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it is there for a reason. I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery. It was a first - person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner. Now some people would have been very offended by this book because the @CAPS3 were calling the @CAPS4 all those names that the @CAPS4 do not like to be called. But that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people. People can go to any library, from one in an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book about the @CAPS6. Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books because nobody liked or does like @CAPS7, but they have to be there because of history. People can not just take the books out because it offends so many people. That would be like taking the @CAPS6 out of history, and that just can not happen. If it happened, it happened, and people have to know. Whether people admit it or not, they have run into at least one book that has offended them. That will happen; it is almost natural for it to happen. But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf. Those people know that books teach us, and we need books to know what is possible, what happened, and what might happen. Books are here for a reason, and they need to stay. In conclusion, offensive yet historically significant books in libraries play a vital role in educating the public and preserving historical truth.
1556	4533	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries each have their own rights to have what they want on their shelves. Yes, you @MONTH1 say that some things are inappropriate for children to see, but every library has a children's section so that children would not have to encounter inappropriate things. I feel that no one has the right to tell another store where to place their items.   Also, I can understand where the author is coming from, but you have to understand that there are people in the @LOCATION1 who would like to read or listen to inappropriate things that parents would not allow their children to see or listen to. I would also suggest that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 don't let your child or children visit that library or that specific place where you know there are objectionable materials. Everyone has their own personal right to place their things where they want them to be.   There are many other options. @CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child. When I was a young girl, my mom never let me go anywhere alone, so I never had to worry about seeing anything inappropriate or offensive. Nowadays, in @DATE1, children know right from wrong. They know what they should and should not read.   I also agree that if a librarian or an adult sees or hears children looking at or listening to something they know they shouldn't be, they should stop the child or guide them away from the premises.   So, no, I do not agree with you. I still think that people should have the right to place their things where they want because it is their stuff and their property. In conclusion, respecting individual rights and providing appropriate access controls is the key to handling such situations in libraries.
1557	4534	2	3	Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you absolutely despised and thought that if that book was removed from the shelf, it would save many people from wasting their time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people, it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people encounter this problem, and personally, I have faced that issue too, but that doesn't mean the material needs to be taken off the shelf.   If everybody in the world goes to a library and picks one book off their local library shelf to discard, just one, because of their own personal reason or simply because they didn't like it, there would hardly be any books left!   If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then they should simply not read it or listen to it. Other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading about that topic or like that kind of music. I understand that some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but if it offends you, don't read it. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to some individuals, but that is history, and some people might be interested in learning about that subject, or @MONTH1 even need that information for a research project.   There are also many books on the @CAPS1. Some people @MONTH1 find that offensive, or @MONTH1 not want their kids reading about it, but that is history. It's a period in the past, and it @MONTH1 be something a high school student is researching for a paper. I have done a research paper on the @CAPS1 and have read some very mature material that younger kids @MONTH1 not need to learn about at present, but I would not recommend removing every book on the @CAPS1 from the shelves of our local library.   There are various reasons for reading a book. If you want to read a book for enjoyment and end up with one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic. Some people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic it covers doesn't give anyone the right to remove the book from the shelf, claiming that it sends a bad message to younger kids or might be offensive to some people. If people don't want their kids reading about that topic, they should tell them not to check out such books at the library.   If it becomes a major issue where people find a large number of books offensive, then the library could maintain a list of books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books with the suggested age of readers beside it, or there could be different sections in the library: one for kids, one for teenagers, one for adults, and one for middle - aged people. Also, if necessary, each library can provide computers for patrons to look up a book and understand what it's about. This will help people avoid reading offensive books and find ones more suitable for their interests.   Songs are a different matter. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing about what they want. If people find the profanity in a song offensive, then they should not listen to it. There's no way to tell a songwriter not to sing or rap about what they desire, and stores will sell albums that generate business. If people don't want their kids exposed to that kind of language or message, they can simply tell their kids not to listen to it. Artists will create music that makes money, and that's a fact. In conclusion, respecting diverse interests and providing appropriate guidance is the best approach to dealing with potentially offensive media.
1558	4535	2	3	The books, magazines, music, and movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves. They still contain valuable information that someone other than you @MONTH1 wishes to know. If you take them off the shelves, the people who want to use them won't have the opportunity.   If you remove books, then if someone needs one for a research paper they have to complete, they won't have the necessary resources. At the same time, the person who wants the non - educational books removed might also find that they won't have the books they desire.   If they want the book taken off the shelf because of inappropriate language or nudity, then the libraries can create a section that you have to be a certain age to access. I was at the library, and there was a woman getting upset because her son had a movie and a book that she didn't think were suitable for him. The book and the movie he had were in a separate area so that minors weren't supposed to access them. So, the woman might be the one who would probably want to take them off the shelves, but it wasn't the library's fault that he wasn't where he was supposed to be.   The products should stay on the shelves because someone needs them for something; otherwise, they wouldn't have been there in the first place. If they remove the products that certain people don't like, then the people who do like them won't have access. If there are reasons to remove a product from a shelf, it should be moved to another location where those who want to use the products can access them.   The products should remain on the shelves so that the people who need or simply want to use them can do so. In conclusion, keeping the products accessible while implementing age - appropriate restrictions is the ideal way to manage library collections.
1559	4536	2	3	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:   Censorship, does @CAPS2 truly deserve a place in our society? There has been a great deal of controversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, regarding the same topic, hold the exact opposite view. They believe that the words of the artists and authors express feelings and have hidden messages within the words of vulgarity, and this is where I stand on the situation.   @CAPS2 seems as though every time we approach this issue, @CAPS2 keeps resurfacing. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones who feel they must enforce proper etiquette and have everyone act in a similar manner. Unfortunately, these people often have significant influence over what comes and goes, not allowing many of us in the lower - graded levels of society to have a say in vetoing their narrow - minded outlook.   My opinions lead me to believe that there are two sides to this story. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, and only one, situation where I feel censorship is necessary. That is when a song goes on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this' and '*bleep that'.   All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There are just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics or read the words carefully to understand the full message before automatically assuming there is a problem with @CAPS2.   Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 is about family or just life in general. However, many of the words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By that simple '*bleep*', you can miss the message that is being conveyed.   Also, have you ever heard the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2 is just like talking but with either pages or instruments.   And that's how I will conclude this debatable topic. I hope I might have changed some of your opinions today. If not, then it's your loss. Thank you for your time.   A @CAPS6 to the @CAPS7, @LOCATION1. In conclusion, while there are rare cases for censorship, overall, we should embrace the freedom of artistic expression to fully understand the messages behind the works.
1560	4537	2	3	Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child - friendly. Songs today may hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors that children should not witness. Does that mean they should be restricted by a public place, such as a library? Several people would agree, but I disagree.   Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeatable, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed meaningless at first, but when you thought about them more deeply, they had a lot to offer. Even looking at the music videos, they showed actions and images that little children shouldn't be imitating. Some @MONTH1 may restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of their freedom.   You can go to any public library and browse through numerous selections of books, DVDs, CDs, and even magazines. Some libraries even have computers available for public use. Not all places will carry your favorite artist, movies, or reading material because they believe it isn't suitable for little children. But who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material they like? That's like taking away part of a person's individuality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a single - minded track.   Limiting a child's media consumption could benefit them in some ways. Restricting time on computers, limiting the number of hours spent playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time - management skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult, which could get them into trouble. However, libraries shouldn't have to remove the offensive media from the shelves. Instead, age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.   Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children doesn't mean a library should limit public access to it. Setting restrictions on renting that material could solve all issues, in my opinion.   In conclusion, censorship in public libraries could be beneficial, but they should just set an age - based renting limit instead of removing all material altogether. This way, parents will be happier, and a person's freedom to develop their own opinions and preferences regarding different types of media will not be restricted.
1561	4538	2	3	Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1? Do you think that children can control themselves when exposed to offensive behavior? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves accessible to children, if they are found offensive. I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or read that action book their brother is reading. I think they should carefully consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch an over @CAPS1 rating movie. You would feel extremely guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life. You have to make a choice on whether it's comfortable for them to view what they're watching or reading! It's important to hide them so the child cannot get a hold of them. Be wise about the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a well - defined section for children in libraries. It should have all the materials that a child should be interested in, and it should be as colorful and playful as possible. I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brought a movie to watch when @CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I gently put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and saw me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to scream! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom to go to sleep, but to my surprise she was still awake! I rushed over to her and quickly put her back to sleep, hoping she didn't have any nightmares. Please be courteous to the things you let children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull those over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children.
1562	4539	2	3	Everyone is @CAPS1. Every single @CAPS2 person is @CAPS1, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and so on? As I pointed out before, we all are @CAPS1, so we all have @CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive and what is good. When we remove a book from a library shelf for whatever reason we have to do so, then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If I picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and I am a @CAPS4, then more than likely I will find it offensive. Yet if I gave that same book to a @CAPS3, that person would most likely read that exact same book that the @CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all. It all comes down to the views we all have about everything. So why would you let one person or even a small committee set standards on library censorship? They @MONTH1 feel one way while another committee or person feels completely @CAPS1. Everyone is @CAPS1 and feels differently about issues. There is no way to make sure that @CAPS2 book in the library won't offend a single person. The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magazines, and so on. No matter what we do, someone will be offended. For example, the pledge of allegiance is something my school says every day, yet some people, like a @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All across the nation, people say it before school, a sporting game, or other events, yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have observed that most people who find it offensive just ignore it. So why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and so on that we @MONTH1 find offensive. In conclusion, there really is no way to put a censorship in libraries since no matter what, a person might or will find something offensive. So why then can't we just not read what offends us? This really is the only way to keep from offending people. For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a censorship in libraries.
1563	4540	2	3	Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. They are all somehow offensive to certain people, but not to all. Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds. I firmly believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public view. When a book is banned, a precious piece of history is removed from others' sight. A book that @MONTH1 have been banned in the @DATE1 could not have been read by my mother or father. My future children and I could also never be able to read it. Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content. When I was about eight years old, I remember seeing on the news that people in @LOCATION1 and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 countries were burning books from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series, only because it contained magic and ridiculous fiction. Maybe they were being burned because the @CAPS5 looked down upon its story and its fictional tales, but that does not mean it should be banned from the libraries. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series is one of the most popular pieces of literature of my generation, and generations after mine should be able to enjoy it as much as we did. Before the beginning of @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the @CAPS11 were starting to be discriminated against. They were treated as sub - humans, like in this example. There was a night in @DATE2 called @CAPS12, when radical @CAPS13 and @CAPS14 supporters burned @CAPS11' houses, stores, and even books. Some of those books could have been the only copies, yet the @ORGANIZATION1 let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of @CAPS16 literature. Because the @ORGANIZATION1 found the @CAPS16 work offensive, the generations after @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 can never read the books burned during @CAPS12. In Katherine Paterson's quote, she says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I whole - heartedly believe she is correct in this quote. If literature keeps being censored, there will be none left for future generations to enjoy. No literature should be censored, not even the most radical, magical, or fictional. If censorship continues, the future of literature is truly doomed.
1564	4541	2	3	There are many works out in modern times which can be considered provocative or offensive. Some are even unfit for young eyes. There are numerous reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I firmly believe that no one, whether a politician or an artist, should have the right to put down someone else's work. There are definitely books in libraries that an ordinary person wouldn't even dream of checking out, but these books should not be put down. I don't believe that a person's work, which is filled with hope, money spent on its creation, personal beliefs, and a lot of hard work, should be removed from public access. No matter how offensive or wrong some @MONTH1 seem, it is their work, their time, and their heart and soul which they put into a book. It is a well - known truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still strongly disagree. For example, even today @PERSON1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is illegal to even possess in @LOCATION1. This is for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one at that, but I believe that this book should still be available so people can read and learn from the past. As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people pour their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well. This is especially evident in the dark psychological science fiction novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS3 @NUM1. This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the @DATE1's, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society. It was even censored itself for a long time. Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come if censorship is freely given power. There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea. That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike. If one removes these from society in any form, then at a basic level, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society. If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself. Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs. There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries.
1565	4542	2	3	Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises its materials and who they allow to check out what. I know that in a certain case, specific to me, my mother did not like me reading a specific series because she thought that it was not appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, she didn't march down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and find something more suitable for me to read. In many libraries, I know that they have well - defined areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of'sub - areas' where they separate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section. Should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children. I do believe that libraries should put clear stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is allowed to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight - year - old should not be able to go in and get a @NUM1 movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment. Libraries should respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos separated from the adult videos and they even have a whole separate section of books for them to discover and explore. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentally stumble upon any raunchy article. So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should clearly distinguish between adults' and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf... then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves, then eventually there will be nothing left to read, and that would be a great loss for all.
1566	4543	2	3	People in certain months have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, specific products, etc. Whether those reasons be personal or professional, it is rather important. Some individuals in those months find the material offensive to themselves. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation. And writing or music could be thought of as unnecessary and irrelevant. The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all of the stuff in the world, someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends practically everyone, should it then be removed. Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it. Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a particular artist and the singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unnecessary. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture is inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved people's lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only know a little about the person and heard barely any of the story. In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people. Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access.
1567	4544	2	3	My opinion on this would be that, they are going to learn about certain adult content anyways so why take that adult content off the shelves? No, I don't think any adult material should be censored. You know when your little girl or boy asks about what they have in their hand, simple, just take that adult content from them and say 'that's something your eyes can't handle.' Naturally, they are going to ask questions and naturally, they will start to wonder, but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal? If I had a child, who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions, I would simply tell them 'that adult content's a mommy and daddy thing', and then hide that adult content in a different place to where I know they can't find it. I mean, when you was a child, of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into their room and looking through their stuff, but then again, you would yell at them for having that adult content when they got older. So don't discipline your children for what they 'stumbled' onto, you should learn how to hide your stuff better. I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need that adult content?) but, as a student looking into the future, I have an opinion. Now let's say that you have a couple of magazines under your bed and your child happens to see them. Naturally, they will start looking at them, and some words might come out, but that does not mean they did anything wrong, it's the parents' fault. Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but, then again, I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life, I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need. So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not supposed to see, check your room, hide your stuff so you won't be the embarrassed one. No, a library can have whatever they want, it's not your place to say what they should get rid of and what should stay. As a student, I stand up and say, No, adult material should not be banned from libraries, then you would hear the adults complaining and that is something we don't need.
1568	4545	2	3	The question was asked 'Do you believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' No! By taking away these things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the shelf, that some people seem 'offensive', you're taking away things that people enjoy. Not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these. So should we do this? I don't believe that we should. There are many reasons that this should not be passed. First, by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these such items. Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store. A lot of people like things that don't have any limits to them. They often find their joy in these things. I know that I, myself, like reading books, listening to music that has no limits. So if you're taking them away or putting limits to it, are people really gonna want to have these things? Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc., that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc., in categories. These categories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading. Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan. Finally, as Katherine Paterson stated 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' If this is really a problem then the parents need to watch what their child is reading, because it isn't right to have everything taken away from the society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading. So what do you think, should this be such a law? The choice is yours. Just remember though, if you agree with this then. Just think of everything you are taking away from other people, do you really want to be that heartless?
1569	4546	2	3	Censorship is a matter of great contention today. Many authority figures have seemingly become obsessed with the notion that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation. Many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright. However, I believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part. Denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them ignorant, not innocent; so many books today are censored, and yet the information contained in them could have been vital to children who are seeking an understanding of the world they live in. One of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not. Books that are viewed as offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as being offensive is just that - a view. It changes from person to person because of varying cultures, religions, and moral codes. No one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf. The problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable. Censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing, but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge. Children should be encouraged to read and to learn, not blocked from doing so. Yet if this is truly the case, why does the censorship debate still rage? The argument continues because, in truth, there really are things that ought to be censored. Movies, music, and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths. Bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children. But that cannot be the sole cause of such behavior; children will act right if they are taught how, not if they are hidden away from every instance of wrong. Censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect. Inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice. But try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it. Do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them? In the end, while censorship has its place, we should be cautious not to over - censor and deprive children of the growth that comes from diverse reading.
1570	4547	2	3	I do believe that we can have materials because there are some good materials that have some good stuff in them. Books, yes, if we don't have any books we can't live properly. If we don't have books, how will people know how to read? Music, I will say yes and no because sometimes music is not good but sometimes people need music to do their work. I will say no to magazines because there can be too much in them. There can be stuff in them that children should not see. In conclusion, we should carefully consider different types of materials. While books are essential for learning and music can have both positive and negative aspects, magazines need to be monitored due to potential inappropriate content for children.
1571	4548	2	3	No, I don't think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be taken off the shelves. If stuff like that gets taken off, then there will be nothing good to read. The books these days are starting to get really good. So, if they take the good books away, then no one will read. Most people think that rap music is bad, but that is the music that most people listen to these days, and most people don't like country. There are some bad movies out there, but they are fun to watch because they are either funny, gross, or they are sad. The bad movies are either gross or funny. If people made better magazines, then they wouldn't make that much money, and that business will go out of business. That's not a good thing because the person who runs the business will have no money to feed his kids. Since I have been alive, most of the good things like books, music, magazines have changed because people don't like the stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again, then people will stop going to the movies and buying books. That's what I think. Now there are a lot of good movies and music coming out. So, if they brought back all the stuff they used to have, then people would have more money. Why people would have more money is because more people would go see the movies from back in the old days. So, like movies from @NUM1 and even @NUM2 would make a lot more money. So, that's why I think they should not take stuff off because that is how we are losing all our money. The people are using the money that they would spend on movies or books and stuff; they are using it for drugs and other stuff that can get them sent to jail and stuff. In conclusion, keeping a diverse range of media available is crucial for both entertainment and economic reasons, and removing items won't solve the problems associated with misspent money.
1572	4549	2	3	What I believe is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes an author to painstakingly write a book is very long. It could be their deepest passion to write, so why would you want to take that away. Every person has an opinion, which is allowed to be held by the freedom we cherish. Material in libraries is carefully sorted by age group, and as long as the material is appropriately fitted for that age group, there shouldn't be a problem. There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you might think is boring could actually be extremely interesting to another person. There are countless opinions in the world, and that is why there are so many different kinds of books. If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that truly help a child? Yes, it could have bad words or certain beliefs, but it could also help someone. If a person is a loner or just likes to be by themselves, they could learn from the character's mistakes in the book. Many children these days are getting bullied or picked on, and don't want to tell an adult. If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would strongly encourage them to tell a teacher. Yes, I agree, every material has something in it that another person does not like. There are a couple of books that I did not approve of, myself, but I know that it has connected with a child somewhere in the world. Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them valuable lessons. You should stop and think if you were a writer, would you want someone to casually throw your hard - earned work in the trash? Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there are negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family. All they care about is their own family. Even the author's family is embarrassed by the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel. Think about your opinion, does anyone really care about what you think? That is why as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion, and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like it, if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trash? If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge. Would you want someone judging your belief or opinion? In conclusion, respecting the diversity of opinions and the hard work of authors is essential for a healthy and inclusive literary environment.
1573	4550	2	3	A lot of things can be found offensive these days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own unique view and opinion on things. For the things people find offensive, I believe they should just simply stay away from it. No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Sometimes, things that people @MONTH1 find offensive, others might truly enjoy. It's simple. If it comes to the point where people are causing problems, then maybe that will be up to the responsible people that work in the libraries. Yes, there @MONTH1 be a lot of things that people take offensive, but that does not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything blatantly offensive, but I have seen some books and movies clearly marked for adults only. Honestly, in my eyes, it's straightforward. If there is something you find offensive, just stay away from it, because others @MONTH1 enjoy it. It's not up to me whether the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do firmly believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into full consideration before jumping straight into hasty conclusions. In conclusion, maintaining a diverse collection in libraries and allowing individuals to make their own choices about what to engage with is the best approach.
1574	4551	2	3	This essay is about censorship for the libraries. Well, there shouldn't be censorship because a lot of this stuff is on TV, like Comedy Central, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, MTV, and a lot of other channels. Should music be censored? No, because the censorship blanks can ruin the beats, the rhythm, and the lyrics. The censorship ruins how the song naturally goes and it makes people mad because they like a certain song, but if they want to listen to it in its original form, they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it are @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and a lot more. Movies shouldn't be censored either. It's the parents' choice. If they didn't want the kids to watch or hear the things in a movie, they shouldn't pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms. Books!!! should not, I repeat, should not be censored because what if the adults want to read them. That isn't fair for them because all of this is often about kids. Kids are smart about this; they know what to read and what they shouldn't read. TV shows! They are the best thing ever. There are a lot of shows that are funny, awesome, thrilling, and a lot more. But it gets to you. Here's an example: @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and more play a lot of good movies, but since they have to block out the words and parts of the movie, it really doesn't make sense to watch it because there are parts they really haven't seen, and they have to go rent it or buy it to see the complete movie. Am I right? All I am saying is that the censorship ruins a lot of TV shows, movies, and music, and nobody wants that. It ruins the entertainment for people, and that's sad to see because actors, music writers, writers, and a lot more spent a lot of their time for the fans and their work. When they could be with their families!!! Well, this is the end of my essay. In conclusion, censorship in media restricts the creative expression and enjoyment of various forms of entertainment, and it's important to trust individuals and parents to make appropriate choices.
1575	4552	2	3	There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue. On materials, like music and movies, there are clear ratings on the item stating what age is appropriate for the content that the music or movie has in them. Like movies, there are ratings such as @CAPS1 which means that you should be @NUM1 or older to view it. @NUM2 which is for parental guidance or @NUM3 and up. PG means you should have your parents with you for the younger kids. And @CAPS2 which is for all age groups. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music, the cover will have a label that says explicit content. I agree with this system. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless it is completely necessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item, they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me, and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race, then I agree that it should be taken off the shelves. There are also people out there who are more lenient and others that are more strict. Just like parents for example. A lot of parents want to raise their kids in an environment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let their kids watch and listen to items out of their age group. Like with me, my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want, and in my opinion, I turned out just fine, while others might not think so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items, and they turned out to be well - behaved adults. Then there are also people who had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vice versa. That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary, I guess I could say that everyone has their own opinions and views, and we should respect the diversity of those opinions while also having reasonable standards to ensure the well - being of all.
1576	4553	2	3	Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked clearly saying that they may be found offensive. From my own experience, I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my deeply - held religious beliefs. Most times I will simply ignore it and move on to a better - suited book or movie. Sometimes, however, it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do. Have you ever read the book The Catcher in the Rye? If you have, you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they discuss certain risky behaviors of the characters. Most people, like myself, do not agree with these portrayals. They think that it is wrong. Again, some people may try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful piece of literature. As you may have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book Huckleberry Finn removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native Americans by a more derogatory word. The law has not passed yet and the book has remained in schools. The law hasn't passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people may not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed. Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people may find the books offensive while others may not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appalling. The book may only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isn't that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem, then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section. I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my observations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in their hands. Once again, I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries, only censored to the people of whom it is offensive. In conclusion, a balanced approach of labeling and sectioning is the best way to handle offensive materials in libraries, respecting both individual sensitivities and the rights of others to access diverse content.
1577	4554	2	3	In the United States, everyone wants censorship. Mainly because they don't want to be the outcast. That's understandable in the case that we have a numerous amount of different races in the United States. In some ways, censorship is necessary and in other ways, some people just want attention. If all different races want censorship, then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people? Essentially, the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction. For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, that might be insulting to another group of people. Then that group of people wouldn't like a reference to another book, which another group of people dislike, and it goes on and on. So for the censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be some tolerance. On the other hand, young children are in need of censorship. They grow and mature every day, developing physically and mentally. So if we were to put an inappropriate book in front of them, they would read it and accept it as standard. And when they read bad things like that, they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives. We are all different, and interpret things in different ways. So when you watch a movie or listen to music and think it's wrong, someone right around the corner may think that it's just normal. If you question someone's movie or song, in the scheme of things, you're questioning their judgement, and that's unfair to them. In conclusion, while censorship has its place, especially for protecting children, we need to approach it with a high level of tolerance among different groups in a diverse society like the United States, and respect individual interpretations.
1578	4555	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and in - depth study, something that everyone should have access to. If someone is offended by one of these things, I do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements. Many people will still find these books or other resources extremely interesting. If the source is something more adult - oriented, then it should be placed in a section that is clearly labeled or supported by information that says so. Radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs, and violence, but I believe that kids need to be associated with these things in a controlled way. Parents can't keep their children from it all of their lives, and most of the bad things said are cut out during the broadcast. Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes. So why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because it's offensive to one person? In conclusion, a balanced approach of proper labeling and access control is the best way to handle potentially offensive entertainment and study materials, allowing everyone to have access while respecting individual sensitivities.
1579	4556	2	3	I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc., because people should have the right to read anything that they want. People do not necessarily like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school, then they need to have the resources available to them. Take the book, The Scarlet Letter in the Puritan era, for example. In that book, it describes the complex social and moral issues including adultery and the resulting ostracism. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though no one would really want to read about such uncomfortable topics. Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not overly gory) because they get me thinking about what's going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them. Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be unaffected by it. Just imagine watching a satirical movie about a particular religion and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while other people couldn't care less. Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it. In conclusion, the right to access diverse materials in libraries should be protected, and individual sensitivities should not lead to the removal of content that others may value.
1580	4557	2	3	Censorship in media has been around since the beginning of the film industry. Some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries - how do they even need to be censored? Censorship of books should be such that if a book is not suitable for children, keep them away from it. Books that are extremely offensive, with content that goes against basic moral and ethical standards, should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library at all. A library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment, and those very offensive books do not contribute to learning or are not entertaining in a positive way. Music is another thing. Most popular songs out there are highly offensive, with explicit lyrics about sex, drugs, and using vulgar language. They should be in a different section. They should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five? Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably would like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to do with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today. Maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored. Movies are almost the same as music because it portrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual. Again, parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear. Libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library. They should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture. Over the years, it has become harder to censor magazines. Magazines are almost impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine. If you are the libraries receiving the magazines, grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive. The libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines. If you are at a library and you see something inappropriate, tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question. In conclusion, libraries should take a proactive approach to censorship, using labeling, sectioning, and basic censoring techniques to protect the interests of all patrons, especially children.
1581	4558	2	3	Yes, I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people simply do not want to read about those things that hold little interest for them. Materials of this kind can offend many individuals, so they should be removed from public shelves. For example, someone, by accident, say in @MONTH1, might stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. They could take it home and begin reading it, only to realize that the material they are reading contains information that offends them. This really concerns some people and can damage the reputation of the library that held the book, and they could start losing customers. Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is the presence of children. What if a young child was wandering around a store or a library and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? That young child would see things that were not meant for their innocent eyes. Unfortunately, such incidents do happen. Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. They would most likely do everything in their power to get those materials removed from public display and out of a child's reach. Children definitely do not need to be exposed to such things, and even some adults do not prefer it either. Religion is also an example of why places should be cautious about what they put on their shelves. It might, in @MONTH1, be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. And without them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and extremely upset. This could turn many people away from reading certain books or even going to the store where they purchased those materials. In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can cause offense to many people.
1582	4559	2	3	As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels that if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books, perhaps in @MONTH1, may be offensive to some, but not all. I don't think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by just anyone because everyone's preference on books can vary. I believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a specific section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading inappropriate material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, stating that not all the material could be appropriate. People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair to the people. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, form study groups, and conduct research for practically any topic. Limiting the number of books based on one person's opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was the internet, and many people still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovery. To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a particular section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but they are also kept away from those who don't want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone likes different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children won't find books with material in them that they shouldn't be reading. By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they don't want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book without any argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasn't appropriate for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didn't want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from anyone else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would have been easier in the situation. In conclusion, I don't believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, it doesn't mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsensored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration the points above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section.
1583	4560	2	3	I don't really read books. I think that offensive things should be taken off the shelves because there could be a scene of chaos if they aren't. There are many people who will engage in a fight if they are truly offended, and it's not a pretty sight. For instance, in a public library, if a person comes across a book with extremely offensive content, they might get so angry that they start an argument with the library staff or other patrons. This kind of situation can disrupt the peaceful environment of the library and make it an unpleasant place for everyone. Moreover, if offensive materials are left on the shelves, it can give the impression that the library doesn't care about the sensibilities of its users. This can lead to a loss of trust and a decrease in the number of people visiting the library. In conclusion, removing offensive things from the shelves is necessary to maintain a harmonious and respectful environment in public spaces like libraries.
1584	4561	2	3	I believe if I worked at a library, if I found multiple items that have profanity, racism, or slang, I would agree with taking magazines, perhaps @CAPS1, music books, and @CAPS2 books, etc., off the shelves. I wouldn't want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism, etc. I would like to inspire more people to check out library books, but you couldn't do that if there were inappropriate books. If I worked at a library and I had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults and young children to check out. How would it make you feel if I didn't do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home an inappropriate book? How would you respond to it? I would conduct an observation on all the books that we had in our library. I also think that all libraries should have more inspiring books, cartoons, and baby books for little children. I think if the majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book, I think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf. Not only wouldn't I want my children to see it, I wouldn't want someone else's children to see it either. This is how I feel if my child picked up a bad, vulnerable book. I wouldn't let him or her go back to the library until they organized their library. Lastly, I think libraries should have a big room full of little kids' books. Also, I think they should have different age - groups, like one room for baby books, another room for @NUM1 to @NUM2 year - olds and on up. I hope this inspires you. Always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the book is going to be about. By taking these steps, libraries can ensure a safe and appropriate reading environment for all their patrons.
1585	4562	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has existed. As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unacceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that they deem unacceptable. Everyone has an individual view of what is unacceptable, so that, perhaps in @MONTH1, might leave no book left on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to stop them from banning all that is there. There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government, in @MONTH1, may not see it as something to be censored. This brings up another question: what deems something unacceptable to be viewed? In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material. The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. The novel, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' was once censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of American culture, and the effect that it had on American literature to this day would have been lost. I see literature as another form of art. Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. Artists are ones to take risks, and so are writers. If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risky. Should we have censored them? Another instance under which censorship had a negative affect on society and culture was during the @CAPS2 regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under @CAPS3's rule. A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed unacceptable just because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power of picking what is unacceptable into the hands of one group of people? Whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation. In conclusion, we should be extremely cautious about giving the power of censorship to any entity, as it can have far - reaching and detrimental effects on our culture, society, and the progress of human thought.
1586	4563	2	3	There has been a concerning problem with censorship in libraries recently. A large number of books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries simply because they are found offensive by some. However, there are also libraries that take a more open - minded approach and do not remove items just due to being offensive. There are numerous reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but in essence, libraries should not have to censor certain items.  One reason why offensive material should not be removed is that material considered offensive could be given a clear and prominent label that warns people about the content in the book or movie. If a child tries to check out a book or movie with such a warning label, they would have to have a parent present to approve the item the child wishes to get. Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is ultimately the decision of the parents.  Another reason offensive material should not be removed is that parents would have the opportunity to approve the item their child is getting. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they can restrict it. If the item doesn't seem overly harmful, they can allow it. This decision, as it should be, is up to the parents.  Books or movies considered offensive could also be given their own distinct section in a library. Children would not be permitted to enter that section without parental supervision. And once again, this is a decision that lies in the hands of the child's parents.  There are many valid reasons why offensive material should not be banned. Such material, however, should have reasonable restrictions on who should and should not check them out. By implementing these measures, libraries can strike a balance between freedom of access and protecting the sensibilities of different patrons.
1587	4564	2	3	Everyone has their own unique opinions and arguments about various things. There are a great many books that can be offensive to people in different ways. There can be over thousands of books in a library, and at times, I find it quite difficult to locate the right book that piques my interest. My personal opinion is that I do not think books should be removed from the shelf just because they might offend someone.  As I stated earlier, everyone has their own viewpoints. There are so many different types of books out there, ranging from murder mysteries, romances, and detective stories to those dealing with drugs and other controversial topics. These books should be placed in separate areas, just like many are already. If books are taken off the shelf, what does that imply for us? Everyone has their own freedom. So, if books are removed because of one person's offense, it's taking away from our individual freedom.  There's more to a library than just books. There are also movies, music, magazines, etc., and all of them can come in different varieties. I firmly believe they should just be placed in different areas. I understand where people think that this might influence young children if they pick up something disturbing, but they should be accompanied by an adult. Adults have a better understanding of what is right from wrong compared to children. For example, whenever I walk into public places, I rarely see children just running around, especially in libraries. Libraries are expected to be quiet, not a place for kids to jump around and scream. Kids should be with their parent or an adult so they can't grab something they shouldn't.  I understand that some teenagers can be offended by the mention of drugs or killings in magazines or books, but some people enjoy reading about that kind of stuff. Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf just because one person is offended? Many seem to think they have the right to do anything without negotiating with others. People who don't like that kind of stuff should simply put it back down and continue with what they were doing. I can understand if you think that restrictions should be put in place, and I agree. There should be sections for teens, adults, and children. But to me, that doesn't mean we have to remove anything from others just because it offends someone.  Libraries can have a positive impact on our everyday lives because of how calming and soothing they are. We should be able to have the freedom to access a wide range of materials without having things removed. Taking away things doesn't just affect one person; it affects everyone. We can have our own form of censorship in libraries while still respecting individual freedom. These are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or other areas in libraries.
1588	4565	2	3	There are lots and lots of heated arguments over the censorship of books and how they could potentially affect children. Some people firmly believe that offensive books should be removed from library shelves. Others, on the contrary, think that they should remain available for those who want to read them. Some parents of children claim that their child has become more offensive towards others after being exposed to certain books, while others think it is just a result of bad parenting. So, as you can see, there are many different stances regarding offensive material being presented to children.  I think that there are some offensive things that need to stay on the shelves and some that shouldn't. Some articles that are offensive should be left up because they might teach children what is bad and what isn't. For example, there are books that depict historical atrocities so that future generations can learn from the past. Other articles that have no valid reason for being offensive should be taken off the shelves. For instance, there is music that talks about being extremely harsh and disobedient to others when that person has done nothing harmful. One good example of being offensive in a positive way is the book '@PERSON1'. This book vividly showed how bad slavery was and how it should never happen again.  If there is a book or any other piece of material that is offensive in a good way, I want to read it and understand what it is trying to convey to me. If it is portraying a bad image, then it should be removed from the shelves. If it isn't portraying a bad image, then I believe it should be taught to children so they can understand the effects and know the difference between right and wrong. Books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be discarded. This is because children who read such books could be influenced to engage in what the book is suggesting, which could lead to bad consequences for that person or someone else.  I have witnessed accounts where someone has listened to bad music or read about something bad and then has been negatively changed by it. There have been incidents where that person did something illegal and then had to face the harsh consequences for that action. On the other hand, I have also seen accounts where people have been positively changed because of a book. I personally have been changed in a good way by the book '@ORGANIZATION1'. Now I realize how bad that was towards colored people, so I make sure to behave nicely towards them as they are just as equal to everyone else. In conclusion, we should carefully evaluate offensive materials in libraries and make decisions that balance the need for education and the protection of the vulnerable.
1589	4566	2	3	REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A POOR IDEA. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRACTICE BECAUSE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE PERMANENTLY REMOVED. INSTEAD, THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS. BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP. THIS APPROACH WILL HELP KEEP CHILDREN INNOCENT AND PURE, PRESERVE HISTORY, AND UPHOLD FREEDOM OF SPEECH. BY IMPOSING AGE LIMITS ON CERTAIN BOOKS, WE CAN ENSURE THAT CHILDREN REMAIN INNOCENT AND UNAFFECTED BY INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH BOOKS LIKE '@DATE1', KIDS @NUM1 OR UNDER SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO READ IT. CHILDREN @NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NAIVE. THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF SEX OR PRE - MARITAL SEX. WITH @PERSON1 AND HIS GIRLFRIEND HAVING SEX IN EVERY OTHER CHAPTER, IT IS EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR A CHILD TO READ. MOREOVER, WITH ALL THE TORTURE PARTS, IT WOULD TERRIFY A LITTLE BOY OR GIRL. WHEN WE GET RID OF OFFENSIVE BOOKS, WE UNINTENTIONALLY ERASE HISTORY. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF ANNE FRANK HAD NOT WRITTEN HER DIARY. WE WOULD NOT HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF HOW TRULY EVIL HITLER WAS. WE COULD ONLY MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. REMOVING BOOKS BECAUSE THEY ARE 'OFFENSIVE' IS A RIDICULOUS REASON. BOOKS ARE ONLY OFFENSIVE TO SENSITIVE PEOPLE. BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE! WE MUST ASK OURSELVES: 'WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY?' FINALLY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WHY THESE BOOKS SHOULD REMAIN. AUTHORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT. IF A READER DOES NOT LIKE A BOOK AND FINDS IT OFFENSIVE, THEN THEY SHOULD SIMPLY NOT READ IT. IF SHAKESPEARE HAD BEEN TOLD HE COULD NOT WRITE HIS STORIES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET. COUNTLESS BOOKS WOULD BE LOST IF AUTHORS WERE RESTRICTED BECAUSE OF OFFENSIVENESS. BOOKS THAT ARE TOO OFFENSIVE OR INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE AGE LIMITS. IF WE GET RID OF CERTAIN BOOKS, WE ALSO LOSE A PART OF OUR HISTORY. REMOVING THESE BOOKS SENDS A MESSAGE TO FUTURE AUTHORS THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOES NOT MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO OFFENSIVENESS. SO, WE SHOULD KEEP THE BOOKS AROUND. AFTER ALL, THEY ARE JUST WORDS THAT CAN TEACH US SO MUCH.
1590	4567	2	3	Many people claim that certain books should not be allowed on the library shelves. They assert that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read. These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.' Librarians and public officials, however, have gone too far in thinking they should have the authority to decide who reads certain books and who does not.  In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find highly offensive. These words, nonetheless, are crucial to the setting of the novel. The author is not expressing that she personally believes @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during that time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a manner. The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is an excellent way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10. Without the descriptions in the novel, a significant piece of history would remain unknown to many.  The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to explore the life of a pubescent, whiny teenager. The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters. The characters, though, are high - school boys living at a boarding school. To tone down the language or make the novel 'kid - friendly' would make it impossible to accurately describe the true nature of the characters. The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations. These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of the plot as well as the changing character traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1.  Literature is not the only medium being targeted by those trying to completely censor libraries. Music, movies, magazines, and video - games are also being affected. In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those lacking the maturity to handle them. It should be remembered that it is the parents' responsibility to censor materials for their children. Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a part of daily life. Library patrons should not be shielded from these real - life occurrences.  In conclusion, many times it is essential for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given the power to control which materials reach the library shelves. Libraries should offer a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public. If libraries do this, it becomes the responsibility of either the parents or the individual to select books that are within their personal boundaries. By maintaining this balance, libraries can fulfill their role as a source of knowledge and free expression.
1591	4568	2	3	Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain. All literature, whether it's a classic novel, a modern poem, or a controversial essay, should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude, then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a powerful tool when it comes to persuasion. So we must be cautious about what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes.   Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a unique point of view, but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard - work from the library shelves? It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library.   No matter how crude a topic might be, it still might be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on, then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course, there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure, and that is why permission should be required to obtain these books. A small, locked - off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way, the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian.   A book not read might as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some people feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their child's eye or because a person might be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive, there will be no books left. In conclusion, we should preserve the diversity of literature in libraries while taking necessary precautions to protect those who may be vulnerable to inappropriate content.
1592	4569	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life. Maybe it's politics; it could be a favorite sports team. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear.   Opinions of some books and media - type materials are often biased. People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library. For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library. The grandchild picks up a self - help book and starts to read. Later, the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents. To the grandmother, the book is offensive.   Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it. It obviously isn't hard to do. So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen to it. If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it.   Mark Twain said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' His statement is as true as any statement could be. What would be left? Everyone has an opinion, and likely someone will always find something offensive. Therefore, offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves.   Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it? It's just easier to move on and forget it. Ignorance isn't all bad. In the end, we should respect the diversity of media in libraries and make personal choices based on our own preferences rather than trying to censor everything.
1593	4570	2	3	Taking books off the shelves will not change anything. Children are just going to go to a different place to find the book, like going to a book store or other libraries if they like it. If I saw a book and I knew I wasn't supposed to read it, but then I knew it was a good music - related book, or a good magazine, I would get it because that's what children do: they explore. Books are here to be read and to be looked at. I feel if you know I'm not supposed to read it, make me show proof of age or don't give it to me.  Really don't understand why some books are in stores and people don't want you reading them. Some children don't read at all, and to see them pick up a book and sit down to read should be good enough. But there is always an age group that isn't supposed to read some books. But at the same time, you can't keep the child away from the world and what it brings. The books are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.  I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that sometimes the track relates to them in a way that another person would not understand. So they feel the song differently than what another person would hear, just the beats, the rhythm, the melody, and the lyrics. That's not what some parents want you to hear.  Magazines tell a lot of things and show too much for the younger minds. I'm a father myself and would not want my son at the age of 10 looking at any naked girl or ads about porn in Playboy books or any of that kind. Parents can sometimes be over - strict on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they know what's best for you. Whatever they tell you is not wrong because they have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behind their backs. But if they want to learn the easy way, it's always the hard way. In conclusion, while parents should guide children, completely restricting access to certain media may have unintended negative consequences, and a balanced approach is needed.
1594	4571	2	3	When you go to a library, you usually have a lot of choices about reading books, watching movies, or listening to music. And sometimes, you might come across offensive words or abusive language that is not appropriate for your children. Students should have the right to remove the book from the library if he or she gets offended. Sometimes, if there is a student who has come from a different culture, they might get offended by the movies or music that are in the library.  Books are most commonly used in the library. In those books, there are some that are offensive to some students. If one student finds something offensive, he should have the right to remove the book from the library shelf. Many students like fiction books, which are based on true stories but might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student might find racist. School or any public library should remove books that contain inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life.  Music is also one of the important things that is carried in any school library or any public library. The most common types of music that you can find in the library are pop, rock, or hip - hop music. Most of the time, those kinds of music might not carry any bad words, racism, or any offensive language, but some of the songs might carry something that is not appropriate for school use. Those kinds of music must be removed from any school library or any public library.  Movies are also carried in some libraries, but not every library carries movies. Some of the movies might have blood scenes, abusive language, which might not be appropriate for some children who are at school. You should check the rating of the movie that you are checking out of the library or if you are watching it at home or any other place. Movies might carry some kind of racism in them.  The library is a good source for reading books, listening to music, or watching a movie. While you are reading a book or watching a movie, you might find words which might not be appropriate for yourself or for students who read those books. These movies, books, or music can carry abusive language or something that is racist to some people who came from a different culture. Students should have the right to remove something that is not appropriate for school use, such as books, music, and movies, if they contain something that is not supposed to be in it. In conclusion, libraries should strive to provide a clean and appropriate environment for all users, and students' concerns about offensive content should be taken seriously.
1595	4572	2	3	A lot of people are offended by things that are uncensored. Some people think they should be censored, and others think it should not. It's all a matter of opinion. I don't think anything should be censored because it takes away from the freedom of speech.   With censorship, one can not fully express their self or opinion. That is why nothing should be censored. Censorship restricts the flow of diverse ideas and perspectives. When we censor, we limit the ability of individuals to explore different viewpoints, which can hinder intellectual growth and social progress.   In a free society, everyone should have the right to express themselves and consume the content they choose, as long as it does not cause direct harm. By censoring, we are essentially deciding for others what they can and cannot see, hear, or read. This goes against the principles of a democratic and open - minded community.   In conclusion, we should uphold the freedom of speech and resist the urge to censor. Instead, we should rely on education and critical thinking to help people make informed decisions about the content they encounter.
1596	4573	2	3	I strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelves. Books, magazines, and other materials are based on the author's and musician's real - life experiences and their keen observations. With the large population of readers in the community, I know that the removal of books for what they might contain would have a bad impact on the people as a whole. The world needs its diverse materials. The writer of the book writes based on his Observations and his own personal life experiences. The creator puts so much effort into it, so why take it away just because someone doesn't like how part of it's worded? Movies that are considered bad probably just have a bad word or a scene with a little blood. Lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing. I seriously think some parents think if their kid hears a bad word or sees a little pool of blood, the kid is going to end up in jail. Then there is music. The public thinks that kids should not be exposed to music like rap and hip - hop. I agree with that to some extent, but I also don't see what's wrong if it's Christian rap or a clean song. A musician is not just paid for his or her amazing skills with an instrument, but also for his or her ability to connect with the listener. I truly don't see any reason for taking any form of materials off the shelves. The artist who produces it has a right to their own opinion. The public, I feel, makes a big deal out of nothing. The smallest problems don't define the material as the reader hears the work of the artist. In conclusion, we should respect the creativity and rights of artists and let the public have access to a wide range of materials.
1597	4574	2	3	Where it all started, no one wanted to read. They'd say it's too hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine. Sure, it's educational, but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public. We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, and it can hurt people. The same goes for the media. Books, magazines, newspapers, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best way to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason, everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it all goes wrong. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come. Censorship may just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it all goes wrong whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. At least the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today. With all of these new reality (Music reality) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on TV, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like cable TV don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other. Books are another thing that could use some censorship. My teacher used to tell me, 'Kid, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be. With the world today, it is quite easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if you're angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it all goes wrong. In conclusion, we need to be more vigilant about the content we consume and support proper censorship to build a better society.
1598	4575	2	3	Censorship is a two - sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offensive should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some important reasons that can be thought about before deciding if censorship is right or not. What is too offensive for a student to read? In history, many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone, then how will students be able to learn about the past? If students can't learn about the past, then the past is bound to repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if it's just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities. If books are censored, then that takes away a person's right to freedom of speech. That restricts someone's creativity and sense of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library, then books that are famous now might have never have been read. Books, even if they are offensive, can show someone's thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world. People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do differently for the future. Many things are learned from books every day, and if certain books are taken down, there will be things that will never be learned, because someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher, and when the past is gone, there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offensive can help in many ways. All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about, a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about, then they don't have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books, and without books, there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come. In conclusion, we should preserve the integrity of the book collection in libraries to ensure the free flow of knowledge and ideas.
1599	4576	2	3	Libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials. Within those books, magazines, and movies holds a vast amount of knowledge. The non - fiction selection offers valuable information, and the fiction selection of books contains many entertaining stories and good morals. If libraries began censoring their books, much information will be hidden from the public. The government could have multiple reasons as to why they feel certain books should be taken off the shelf. Some possible reasons could be that they are racist, send the wrong message to children, or spread knowledge that the authority wants to keep away from the common man. Censoring books would be a horrible idea and affect everyone. Some books that could easily be considered to be taken off the shelf would be books that are racist, or suggest radical ideas. Everyone in the world is deemed equal, and books which suggest one race is better than another could offend the readers, and for which the authority decides to have it taken off the shelf. Books that suggest radical ideas could also belong in the group of books being taken off the shelf. The authority could be worried that the reader might carry out this radical/terrorist idea and would in return censor them. But censoring these ideas would be denying the public their chance to learn. There are racists everywhere, and just because you simply toss the book away, won't suddenly rid the world of racists. Another cause why books or magazines might be removed from the shelves could be that they send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content. Parents try the best they can to repel the content away from their children, and books they begin to read, whether it be on their own or in school, could introduce kids of all ages to new content that their parents might not prefer them learning at their age. Parents might have a point, but children can not be protected from everything. They must learn and accept certain ideas as they grow and develop. Parents might be able to censor what their children read in their own home, but to take the books or movies entirely off the shelf would prevent the people who enjoy or see comedy in these articles, movies, music, or books from acquiring knowledge, even if their only purpose of reading is just for laughs. Censoring might also be introduced into libraries because the authority does not want the public learning and developing ideas on what they think the right way of doing something is that the authority disagrees with. They might think if people start learning and developing opinions from books they've read, they might start to oppose the authority. Although people are always going to oppose the authority, not everyone will like what is going on, and to have a growing society and economy, knowledgeable people are needed to invent and develop concepts. In terms of race and religion, everyone is considered equal, but in terms of level of intelligence, everybody varies from one another. Which could be another reason to censor, so the public stays at the same level as their neighbors, so everyone is truly equal. Doing this would once again stop the modernization of the world. Smart people would go unrecognized, and the inventions that could have been stirring in their heads could turn to a blank thought, which is the same as everyone else's. In the book Harrison Bergeron, censorship is the main idea. They censor the books so that everyone is truly equal, and even censor so that people's looks and qualities all are equal to the others. This is not the way to go in a modern society. The authority would have full control, and knowledge would not be blossoming in the schools. Even just a little bit of censoring in libraries, whether it be books, magazines, music, or movies, would put a damper on the knowledge and brain - power of the society around. Censoring books is an awful idea that should never be put into place. The authority should never be allowed to decide what the public views. It is in everyone's own opinion and interest whether they themselves read or listen to the material provided. In conclusion, we should oppose library censorship to promote a free and knowledge - rich society.
1600	4577	2	3	There are many things out in the'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material the right to do the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone has a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what exactly it is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic. People that say that they have offense to whatever the material might be usually use the phrase 'Well, it's offensive and I don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then the creator (the writer of the song/book/movie) can claim that he has been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free - for - all for everyone to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone has the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring the creator down, then the creator has the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as well take everything else down with it. So, if someone finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If someone is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty ridiculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book than to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there has a right to be sold. On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author has written it this way
1601	4578	2	3	Controversy in the public library. When someone walks into their public library, they are overwhelmed with an abundance of books. Even though one person could never read that many books, the library has to have a wide selection, for the people that read different things. The library should not get rid of books that offend some people. The library is a public place that allows people to read what they want. If someone does not agree with what another person is reading, they don't have to be there. Since the library is a public place, people cannot just throw away a book because it is offensive. Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If everyone would throw away books that were offensive, there would be no books left. This would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning. The public library is open for anybody to read a book. Keeping this in mind, the library has to have books that appeal to everyone. If they would only have one type of book, not many people would want to go to the library. The library has to offend some people to please others. People who go to the library go because it is their choice to go and get a book. If people find the books in the library offensive, they do not have to go. Books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them. If someone finds a book offensive, they don't have to read it. Libraries should have as many books as they can, so they can appeal to every taste. They should not get rid of books that offend a small group of people. Those people do not have to read books that they find offensive. Libraries are a public place for anybody to read what they want. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection of books to serve the varied interests of the public, and not let the sensitivities of a few limit access to knowledge.
1602	4579	2	3	Personally, I firmly believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the book shelves. People that find them offensive don't have to read them; they can simply ignore them and move on with their lives. For instance, students in a particular month might need to use that certain information in a classroom. If libraries take the information out of the library, the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper. Students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines, movies, music, and books someday in their lifetime. If offensive books are taken down, where else will they go? They are still going to be offensive somewhere else. Libraries that have offensive books are not trying to offend anyone in any way; they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer. If movies are that offensive, don't rent them and save yourself and the library's time. People get offended by all of these readings from a certain library. If the library chooses not to take the books off the shelves, then go to a different library. Also, the internet will more than likely have all of the information that is just as offensive. The internet is a virtual library where you can search for videos, books, magazines, and music. If people think they are getting rid of the offensive books, magazines, etc., they are wrong because the internet will hold that information for as long as it needs to. Library censorship is a pointless act due to the information provided on the internet. Libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building, as long as those books, music, magazines, movies, etc., are put in the right section. The movies that parents don't want their children to see in a particular month might be placed in the wrong section of the library. From that point of view, you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves. The books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well. Most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended. Movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate. Maybe people overreact to the situation and don't realize that the movie, book, etc., are not offensive enough to make an argument over it. I personally have never been to a library and saw a book, magazine, movie, song that was offensive to me or my family. What does an offensive book look like? More than likely it has something to do with someone's religion, ethnicity, etc. Items are only offensive to certain people. If you or someone you know that is offended greatly by a book, song, magazine, or movie in a specific library, don't go back or tell the person you know as well. In conclusion, if a book, movie, etc., is that offensive in a library nearby, avoid that library and don't worry about going back. Offensive material could also be learning material, and we should approach it with an open - minded perspective.
1603	4580	2	3	Yes, I do think so because everyone has an opinion to express, and these are things people like to look at or listen to. Now, it would be different if it was a children's book store. For example, if they have Christian bible songs or Disney movies in the store, but not have grown - up stuff. I really do not see the big deal if these items are out because everyone likes reading something different. I think as long as you're reading, it doesn't matter what it is, as long as you're learning something. I do not think you can get rid of stuff like movies and magazines because people like to read them or listen to music a great deal. So, it should not really matter what or where they are, if you ask me. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse interests of readers and not overly restrict the availability of different types of media, as they all have the potential to offer some form of value.
1604	4581	2	3	In general, I do believe that book, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are taken as offensive. People should not be putting stuff out there if they are making others feel unhappy about what they do. Although, we might think that putting stuff in papers and on movies doesn't hurt people. Well, guess what, they do. First of all, movies that have stuff to do with sexual relationships. For example, regarding same - sex marriage, some say that people should not marry the same sex. They make fun of them because they are not like others, and they can take that very offensively. Only a very small number of people like being with the same sex. By us putting them in books, on movies, or making songs to make them feel offensive is not the best way to go. Another aspect is about special needs. Movies or books that have to do with people putting down others that have special problems. Although, they don't show that they're sad, it doesn't mean that we didn't offend them in a way. Families that have a special - needs child, sister, brother, mom or dad don't like it very much when someone puts something out there about their problem that they may have. Also, they will feel really upset and sometimes can get mad about that. Most importantly, books or movies making fun of people that don't have a lot of stuff. It's not their fault that they don't have the money to buy stuff like others. For example, a nice house or nice clothes. Most families have problems trying to pay rent and do other bills if only one parent is working. A lot of parents that work are getting laid off and are not even getting paid for it. Worst of all, a family member (like someone who lives in the house) may have to go to the hospital, and when you go to the hospital, you have to pay for the bills. Some families are in and out of the hospital year after year and they don't have the money to pay for new stuff for the house or the people who live in it. In conclusion, generally, I do believe that they should take certain books, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelves because they can be taken as offensive. We don't know how rude it is to have something out there that makes fun of someone in a way until it's too late. Many people really don't like it when they see something out there that's offensive to them. We should be more sensitive to the feelings of others and refrain from spreading offensive content.
1605	4582	2	3	Books are to be read, not taken off the shelves because of what they say. That to me is stupid. Our children live in a world of war and fear every day. What is a damn book going to change? Nothing. They're going to hear the f - word and see blood and gore. Would you rather them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do? Music is one thing that can bring everybody together. So, by our children not being able to hear some of those lyrics, then we are pushing them into being overly sheltered. Maybe there are just some real people telling the truth that you don't want your kid to hear. Movies are something that people love to watch. Come on, we pay a certain amount of money, say $10, to get in and see them sometimes. Our kids are going to be better off because their parents didn't want them to see the new horror movie? They're going to see horror in real life one day, so why not now? Parents, you're not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world. You're actually handicapping us because when we get into that situation in real life, we aren't going to know what to do, and then we're screwed. In conclusion, we should allow children and people in general to be exposed to a variety of media, as it can help them prepare for the real world and develop the resilience needed to face different situations.
1606	4583	2	3	Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a well - stocked library. America, being a free country, upholds the principle that we can write whatever we want. Everyone has the freedom of speech, and that freedom is manifested in various forms like music, books, or a movie. When you are browsing through the library's aisles and find a book that seems offensive, simply put it back on the shelf and move on to another one. Everyone has come across a lot of things that are offensive to different races and beliefs. You might hear jokes that are offensive, but they are just jokes and not to be taken seriously. I recently read a book called '@CAPS1's your @CAPS2'. It was not what I had expected, so I just put it down, picked up a different book, and continued my reading. If everybody were able to take books out of a library just because they found it offensive, would there be any books left at all? Movies have a protective measure against such issues called ratings. The ratings range from '@CAPS3 to @CAPS4'. If the movie you watch is more towards the @CAPS4 section, then it will likely have more offensive language and violent scenes. That's why there is always a blocked - off section at a DVD rental store. This section is only for mature people of the ages @NUM1 or older. If, by any chance, your kid strays into that section and finds something not suitable for him, and you get really angry, just think that @CAPS1 let him wander into that section. @CAPS1 should be watching him at all times as @CAPS1 is responsible for him. I do not agree that reading material or anything of that nature should be taken off the shelves. That's like saying if someone did not like how the @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 was worded, they could simply take it down and throw it away. We would end up with nothing to read. So, the next time you see something that is offensive, just put it back and move on, respecting the diversity of content in the library.
1607	4584	2	3	Censorship in libraries has become overly strict, causing the next generation to miss out on key lessons learned about life. How would you feel if you, as an adult, went to the library and could only check out children's books, simple magazines, and basic music? Now, I know that's a bit of an extreme scenario, but in all seriousness, what are we without knowledge? Where would we be if there were no books, no informative magazines, or no inspiring music left? No libraries would mean no access to knowledge, no captivating books, no valuable life lessons, no room for imagination, and above all, no excitement. We would de - evolve back into our animal - like state because, in reality, we humans have only one thing that has given us the power to become so advanced and smart: our brains. There was once a quote by which I live my life. It went like this: 'if knowledge is power then books must be the means of getting that power'. From my own knowledge and views of the world, I will present my argument on censorships and how they affect libraries. Censorship - what do we Americans think of when we say the word 'censorship'? I think of bad things like cuss words, explicit nudity, and intense battle scenes. The thing is, these elements are displayed in different forms, such as music. An example of music not being censored would be rap. Go ahead and get the explicit version of that rap song; sometimes it might already be quite inappropriate. I personally don't like rap, so this opinion is a bit biased. I prefer rock and metal music. People enjoy music, and censorship takes away from our freedom. If you don't like what they are saying, just don't listen to it. Another subject of interest when we talk about censorship issues is magazines. We all, at some point, have seen or heard of naughty magazines like Playboy. Now, I'm all for making sure those types of magazines stay out of school libraries, but public libraries should have their own adult sections. In these sections, we might not stock Playboys, but we could have hunting magazines or hot - rod magazines lining the shelves. The last thing that is subjected to rather extreme censorship is books. Let's be honest; we all had a favorite book when we were little or as we grew up. One such book that is an absolute classic is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'. It's currently being removed because it has one or two cuss words in it. I mean, really, people. It's a great book, but at the first sign of a cuss word, everybody starts shouting 'burn it'. Now, many of the following generations will never get to read that classic because people took it out of libraries. I feel that people should learn to relax and not fret over one or two cuss words because that seems to be all it takes to ruin a great book. So, what's my final conclusion? When does our First Amendment right to free speech collide with censorship and too much censorship? Apparently, it happens in libraries where one can't read @ORGANIZATION1, learn about wood craftsmanship, or listen to music that involves cuss words. In my personal opinion, adults should have their own uncensored section, teens should have only censorship on things like nudity, and children, well, they are just right on this subject with no more censorship needed. So, I ask you, the one who grades my essay, to just stop and think with an open mind. How long can you hide your children or your grandchildren from the real world? In the real world, these things are deemed acceptable; otherwise, they wouldn't be out there in the first place. Truly, if you decide to take out classics like @PERSON1, we lose not only knowledge and the story but also our freedom.
1608	4585	2	3	Yes, some materials, such as well - written books, soul - stirring music, thought - provoking movies, and informative magazines, etc., can be offensive. Yet they shouldn't be removed from the library shelves. Reason number one is that what some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is that 'offensive' material will always be out in the world. And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their own children from reading them and not impose that ban on the rest of the world. In the following essay, I will thoroughly explain my reasons for holding such an opinion. 'One man's trash is another man's treasure.' This quote fits very well with the first reason: what some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything can vary significantly. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be highly offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, while a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religious person. As you can see, 'offensive' is defined differently by different individuals. Offensive material will always be present in the world. Parents can't shield their children from these things forever. At some point in their lives, children will come across offensive things, and parents won't be able to do much about it. Children have active minds that absorb everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them what is wrong and what is right. Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only restrict their own children and not make decisions for the rest of the world. This reason ties in perfectly with the first one. Parents can't decide what the parents of other children should do. They can only take action regarding what their own children are doing. Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is non - existent for the following reasons. First, what some people find offensive, others don't. Second, offensive material will always be out in the world. And third, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries, allowing for a diverse range of materials to be available for all.
1609	4586	2	3	Should we censor the materials in libraries? Some people believe that some of the books, well - designed magazines, and soulful music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene. This could be a major problem if people are allowed to decide what is too obscene to be put in a library. Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us to explore. Books have been around for centuries. They are passed down through generations, shared among friends, and enjoyed by people all over the world. Books contain important information, captivating stories, and tales of people's past times. Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries. By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech. Also, technology is rapidly advancing. Sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct. With all of the new devices we have @DATE1, people can easily get their books online. Magazines are a great tool to advertise products and talk about some major topics happening around the world. Magazines are an excellent thing to read when you want to catch up on the latest news, exciting sports events, or just other miscellaneous topics. With that said, magazines can also be a concern for public libraries due to some of the explicit content. This is a reason why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned. By getting rid of magazines, you take away a company's freedom of press, which is a major issue. Referring to the previous paragraph, technology is growing at a rapid pace, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1. That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries. My final discussion is about music. Music has also been around for many centuries and has had a profound impact on our lives. Music is something that everyone can relate to. No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, talented music artist, or preferred genre of music. By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either. Taking away music is like taking away a part of human natural culture. We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we cherish. Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries. In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the rich history, engaging stories, up - to - date news, and soul - touching music that is inside of it. Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people. It is true that with the advancement of technology, libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct. Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials, preserving the diversity of knowledge and entertainment.
1610	4587	2	3	Most people have been engaged in a heated debate on whether or not to stop providing books, movies, music, magazines, and so on, if they are disturbing other people's lives and offending them to the point where they are getting extremely infuriated and disturbing the peace. I also think that many people have been complaining about the violence in the community, attributing it to several disturbing books, music, and other forms of media. But I would have to say that most people are influenced, to some extent, by what they read or hear. I think that our society should get over such concerns and learn to live their lives with an open mind. I personally do not think that anybody should be punished for what is being put on the library shelves or in stores, especially in the case of music. I do not think other people who actually enjoy reading and listening to that stuff should be restricted. If they are happy with what they are consuming, then so be it. I do not think that people who actually enjoy reading and hearing what is disturbing to other people should be punished just because somebody else does not like what they are hearing or reading. Why should things that bother other people be removed when they are not actually hurting anything or anybody? In my personal experience, I do not think people should constantly complain. The content in these stores and libraries only makes us stronger as we learn to deal with different perspectives and ideas. In the end, we should respect the diversity of media and allow people to make their own choices about what they consume.
1611	4588	2	3	Most movies, magazines, music, and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world. These forms of media, which are so diverse and widespread, often fall victim to censorship and are challenged daily to be banned, especially books. Mothers and fathers do have the right to prohibit such materials from their own children, as they are responsible for their kids' upbringing. But they do not have the right to ban them from all the world's children. Whatever the reasoning may be, censorship is wrong. It restricts the creativity of the writer, the freedom of the reader, and, as Katherine Paterson well put it, would result in 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' According to the principles of free society, everyone has the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. This does not exempt writers or artists who occasionally, or more than occasionally, include explicit content in their works. In every book, there is a message the writer is trying to tell his or her audience. How they go about getting that message across is their own business, and they have all the right to do so in any way they wish. People who wish not to see the writer's message have the right not to. But when they fear the message and try to stop anyone else from seeing or hearing it, then they are violating the rights of the writer by telling them they cannot include the offensive material. Most writers include this material for a reason. For example, swear words, such as the ones argued in a well - known literary work, often times show the characters' traits and also improve the setting. During those times, people did call others by explicit names, even those who were in no way prejudice. That was the way of life for them and the author was simply trying to show that to the reader. By censoring the word from text, people were, in a way, covering up the history of a particular era. Every person over the age of eighteen has the right to read anything they wish. They are no longer under the commands of their legal guardians and in no way are under the command of other children's parents. Parents who prefer their own children not to see or listen to certain materials have the right to censor the materials away from their children. On the other hand, they have no right to tell their neighbors what and what not their children can see. Every parent has different rules and guidelines for their children, and this is their right. They may believe that it is important for their children to be exposed to these certain materials early on in life so that they can learn right from wrong from the very start. It is possible that they even might not care. Whatever the cause may be, they have the right to expose their children to anything they see appropriate. For example, a well - known author has been challenged throughout her entire career. Many of her books include the topic of menstruation, which many parents found inappropriate for their grade - school children to read. Therefore, those parents brought the books to the attention of the school board, who quickly removed the books from its library shelves. Many parents, librarians, and teachers were upset by this and argued that the topic was not at all harmful. In fourth grade, girls are required to watch a video on the topic of puberty and in fifth grade many girls begin to go through these changes themselves. So how is it inappropriate for them to read fictional books that include the topic? Many parents believe it is not and even encouraged their children to read the books, but the other parents who found it offensive ruined these parents' children's right to read. Therefore, in the long - run, censorship is wrong. It restricts the rights of the audience and of the writer, which prevents growing experiences for both. If everyone was to ban one book they found offensive, the world would be without any books and become quite dull. No one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely.
1612	4589	2	3	The library is a very resourceful place, offering a wealth of knowledge and entertainment. But there are just some things that should not be displayed or made viewable to the public. Some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for everyone and should not be allowed in a public place. First, there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library. What if someone looks up or checks out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone. That person then could end up using the information for the worst. For instance, there could be materials related to dangerous activities or harmful ideologies. Everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages. Next, there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library. So things should be censored so no one ends up getting hurt. The librarian or anyone who's in there may never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it may happen or a problem is started. Therefore, blocks should be put up for things that may be harmful to others. Finally, although people may feel it's no one else's business what they research or check out, they should think, it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at. It's not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of someone. People have to think the library is open to children and the elderly. In conclusion, there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library. There are hurtful and inappropriate things that should absolutely not be allowed. Most importantly, a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what someone looks up, checks out, or even says. It should be a safe and inclusive space for all.
1613	4590	2	3	I say that they shouldn't take off books that are found offensive and I'm going to say why I think that. I think that they shouldn't take off those books because that's the way it was written, with the author's unique style and vision. And if the person that finds that book offensive then just don't read it. Another reason they shouldn't take it off is because an author wrote it, and I'm sure that he or she didn't think that a person was going to find it offensive. They were probably just trying to tell a story or convey a message. My third reason they shouldn't take it off the shelf is because the book might be really good and interesting, except for that one person that thinks it's offensive. There could be valuable lessons, great characters, or an engaging plot that others would miss out on. I just told you all why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because one person says so. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the creative freedom of authors.
1614	4591	2	3	All of the materials in a library should have to be checked out of the library before anyone can take them out of the library. The librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. The topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library. Materials that the library has are for everyone to check out if they want to. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, etc., whether the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly since the librarian can keep track of the materials that are in the library. If you do not check out the materials that are in the library, nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which means, if you checked out materials out of the library, the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out, the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials are out of the library and no one can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait till the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be checked out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library. If you check something out of the library and you lose it, you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that no one will be able to check it out until it either gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the materials because you lost the library's copy of the materials that you checked out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it whenever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore. They can only sit in the library to read the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it, then the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyone that wants it so they can check it out. These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There are a lot more reasons you have to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that are in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library whenever you want it. This system ensures the proper management and availability of library resources for everyone.
1615	4592	2	3	If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive, I would want it removed, but then again I wouldn't. Every one has their own opinions and their own view on things. Mine are different from everyone else's. I mean I may find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might happen to like it even if you don't. Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of someone away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses someone else in some way. For example, a controversial book might represent a different perspective or a unique cultural experience. There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it. Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelf really going to help? It's better to respect the diversity of content and the rights of others to access it.
1616	4593	2	3	Yes, I firmly believe that certain material should be removed from the shelves at a library if they are offensive! This is because people don't want or like to go to any public library that is open to anyone, only to come across some book or other item that is offensive to them. For instance, imagine a child grabs some bad, inappropriate book and his mommy finds him reading it. Naturally, she won't be too happy and might leave the library. That kind of situation could be offensive to anyone in particular. There are certain books, magazines, etc., that simply don't need to be in the library. The public doesn't need to encounter such stuff in a public library. By the way, if someone thinks that a certain book is offensive, they can report that particular book or item if it is offensive to them and they are a regular or irregular visitor at that specific public library. So, one must watch what they bring or put in a public library; it has to be appropriate for all the people who walk into any nice library. Being offensive is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk into a nice public library and be relaxed, not startled by any unreasonable book, magazines, or other items that shouldn't be there. Music is also a big problem when it comes to people being offended. There's so much inappropriate, bad - language music around here. They have to be very careful about what they put in the library, especially for the little kids and seniors too. Books are supposed to be material that is fun or interesting to read for people, not something that people look at or find on the shelves as an offensive book or magazine. That's not what the library is for; it's for going there, relaxing, and finding a book or other item to enjoy and either keep there or check out to use somewhere else. In conclusion, maintaining a clean and appropriate library environment is essential for the comfort and well - being of all its visitors.
1617	4594	2	3	Books, Music, Movies, and Magazines have been taken off the shelves. We are, from now on, forever more blocking or censoring these items. The reasons why it is a good idea are quite clear. There are children, parents, and religious people who are strongly against some of the things that are broadcasted. If you want something uncensored, then you can buy or rent an unrated version. Children are our future, so why would you corrupt a mind that is so young and innocent? Picture this: if your child is one second watching something innocent and happy as can be, and the next is watching people being killed and bombs being dropped, that image will forever be imprinted in his or her mind. I don't think you would be too happy if your child was picking up vulgar language from the TV shows or movies. Imagine your 5 - year - old talking to you and then saying an inappropriate word, not knowing where it came from. You might just ignore it at first, but then that vocabulary grows into worse words and sentences, turning this child into a bit of a potty - mouth, maybe even violent. We don't want our future presidents and authorities to be so violent that they put the world in danger just because they got it from the TV shows, do we? Parents have the right to watch what they want, but they also have the authority to put a stop to what they don't want themselves and their children to view or even hear. More families these days enjoy taking car rides together and going on vacations, watching TV shows and listening to the radio as they go. One minute they are all singing happily, until a song with a bunch of inappropriate words comes on. It's not only disrespectful but embarrassing to listen to your kids sing along to it. So, parents turn it off. Everything is fine until they hear them again singing to their music devices, with images of bombs all around the car. There is no escape. That's when parents should have a say in what their children are not only watching but also listening to and reading. Books about drugs, sex, and violence are not something a 10 - year - old should be reading. We don't need them to be a bunch of stoners either. One minute you think you are reading a book about love and romance, and the next you read that the character is smoking a joint. People with strong religions don't want to be watching TV shows late at night and then see on the screen that a character is doing drugs and sleeping with all these girls. Yes, it might be funny to those non - believers, but to those who have a religion, it is just disrespectful. Then, listening to music and hearing about people with no religion lighting fires to crosses, using vulgar language, and taking the lord's name in vain is not something they want to hear. When it comes to reading a book, the religious have a strong opinion on what should be read, so they usually stick to the Bible. But what happens when their kids go to school and find a fake Bible with nothing but lies and dirty pictures in it? TV shows, Music, Books, and magazines should always be censored. It not only gives a good example for everyone but also helps us as a community to stay strong. Not being violent or cursing after everything you say is not going to hurt anyone. Why would you want a future president to be a violent killing machine? The environment we grow up in is how we turn out. Drugs, sex, and violence being read about or heard is not the way to be. In conclusion, censoring media is crucial for the well - being of children, the peace of mind of parents, and the respect of religious beliefs.
1618	4595	2	3	I firmly believe that they should leave them on the shelves. I think people take stuff like that too seriously. If they don't like it, I think they should just leave it alone. What some people might find offensive, others will find interesting. There is a lot of stuff out there that might be a little offensive to some people, but if they don't like it, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and go on with their life as if it's no big deal. In the past, there has been some movies that make fun of people for the way they act or just something they did in the past. Stuff like that, I can understand the personal reasons behind the offense. There has also been times when I have seen people make a big deal over nothing. Sometimes people say stuff, and the person reading it can take it in a whole different way. There is still a lot of people taking books off the shelf because of someone complaining about the language in it or maybe making fun of another race. I think the worst thing today is magazines because they are always judging people about who they are with, what they did yesterday, or even who has the best body and who has the worst body. I think people should just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about themselves, and we wouldn't have so many problems. In conclusion, everyone has different tastes, and we should respect that by allowing a diverse range of materials to remain accessible.
1619	4596	2	3	Different books are meant for different people. Yes, sometimes it matters when certain materials are not supposed to be shown in public. But, we need to know what's happening all over the world. Even as we speak, there might be a battle going on somewhere, or something very important is about to happen in another country. We will need this information all the time. There's this old saying that I read in a book once, 'You can not judge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it'. It took me a while to understand what they meant by that. Then, I finally understood what they really meant. You can't judge someone by their outer looks; you must judge their inner personality. When you look at a book, movie, magazines, etc., you can not judge it until you see it for yourself. Company people create these things for certain people that enjoy the things they love. TV shows, newspapers, books, etc., are all the things to make them happy. We must enjoy what we have in this life. People always say that the world is going to end. But it won't. For this, we will live on in the after - life. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of information sources and not be too quick to judge, as they all play a role in our understanding of the world and our enjoyment of life.
1620	4597	2	3	BAD CONTENT Do you really want your kids to see bad images or read bad prompts? I didn't think so! You can help by teaching them what is right or wrong, good or bad. You need to help them have a clear conscience so when they come across these obstacles in life, they will know what to do. You could do what my aunt, Mrs. Smith, does. Whenever she goes through the checkout aisle at a local grocery store or other stores, she turns the magazines that she thinks are inappropriate around. My mom and dad say this is a silent protest because she is hurting no one else; she just simply doesn't like it. It makes my dad upset whenever he watches television with us and there is something that they never saw on TV before, like half - naked girls on the commercials. So, he will turn the channel or shut it off because he doesn't want us exposed to the bad things of the world. My mom is the same way. She won't let us watch R - rated movies. If I wanted to watch those, I was usually at my friends' house, and my mom would probably be a little upset. I think books are okay because you don't see a lot of picture books; you have to read them and imagine the image in your head. In conclusion, I hope you would feel the same way I do. So, next time you go through that checkout, stop and say to yourself, 'Do I want little eyes to see this?' Then you should turn that magazine around, turn off the TV and the music. You should also read the book so you know what it is about. By being vigilant, we can protect our children from inappropriate content.
1621	4598	2	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern: As time steadily marches on in this ever - expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought over and argued about is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be compromised. People these days, though, must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established. Censorship shouldn't be up to an organization, but instead to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide? Why should censorship exist in our media if it doesn't exist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing, it's all in how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life. Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech. If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself. In a free society, each individual should have the autonomy to choose what they consume, and censorship undermines this very principle.
1622	4599	2	3	Should materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive? I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to everybody, it would be breaking the law, and it's not fair to the artist that created them. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive, while to others, it's their religion. It would just go to show that one man's garbage is another man's treasure. It would also be breaking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech. It would silence all the great artists out there, trying to be heard. They should be able to write, sing, or film whatever they want. It is their right to do so. That is the reason why they shouldn't be removed from the shelves. It wouldn't be fair to the artist that created them, it would be breaking the law, and what one person thinks isn't what everyone thinks. In a diverse society, we must respect the rights of artists and the varied perspectives of the audience.
1623	4600	2	3	Censorship is a method of limiting certain content that has been deemed inappropriate. This method is widely used today in the modern world. Censorship is used most commonly with our movies, video games, and television. If other forms of entertainment like television and internet utilize such methods, shouldn't our libraries? Also, if these methods are not made mandatory, should there be a block on certain titles that our children could get their hands on? This limiting agent called censorship can be very useful in our everyday lives. Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view. This agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones. So if the precautionary measures are being taken on the following products, wouldn't it be appropriate for the actions to also be in our libraries? Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to wander through the shelves picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inappropriate book for their age group? Personally, that is what a library should be like to me. Discussing the topic that was touched on before, a block should be mandatory for libraries. This block would not abolish the books completely but rather would limit their viewing audience. The books should be categorized by age group. And with the block, certain children, based on age, would not be able to enter the section and would prevent certain materials from reaching children that are not mature enough. Certain materials should not be viewed by younger children. That is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact. The factual experience comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for more mature audiences. These titles heavily influence a child's thoughts and actions. Just the other day, a cousin of mine no older than @NUM1 years old was watching two individuals of the opposite sex and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss? or why is he not touching her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view. The origin of these questions will probably never be known, but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up, and that is censoring what children read, view or listen to in our libraries. By implementing proper censorship in libraries, we can create a safer and more suitable environment for young readers.
1624	4601	2	3	Your @CAPS1. @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to. It could be something someone said about one's religion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive? I don't @CAPS3 believe it should work that way. @CAPS2 are a variety of different religions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf every time someone found it offensive, we would have nothing left to sell. When it comes to younger children, they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it. The media that adults find offensive may not take offense to any of the media, but you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it. Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibility to protect them from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves and make their own judgments. Our religion is a big part of our life because it determines what we believe in and what we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong. I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do. Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do. Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don't @CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching, while others don't @CAPS3 see a problem with it. So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out. Now at movie theaters, you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because if you go by yourself and your parents don't know, they will get upset. With libraries and movie theaters, they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something, it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to abide by them. As with some parents, they have their own rules. Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on. A few years ago, my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6. I didn't @CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned the movie on and we watched it. It had a few words in it that his parents didn't @CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie. His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age. He didn't @CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote. His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from, and he told her the movie, and she didn't @CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble. I told her it was my fault; I let him watch the movie and didn't @CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age. It just comes to show that @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on. So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today. We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed. What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe. So if @CAPS2 is something out there that you don't @CAPS3 believe in, stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it. In a diverse society, we must balance the rights and sensitivities of different individuals and groups.
1625	4602	2	3	How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, I'm going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise any negative books. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover often creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves. What about the younger children who like to read? Although kids have a wild imagination, authors shouldn't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas. First of all, kids nowadays either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly or automatically assume it's not for them. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book, it could hurt their feelings. Books are supposed to provide educational information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people. More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are acknowledging bad examples on their kind, they feel discouraged. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone. When authors, publishers, songwriters, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings. Their main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful. Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures, it should be removed without debate. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. A public library which is open to all should have sections for books, movies, CDs, or magazines that are too vivid. There's a wide range of books laying around, and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive. I believe parents should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me, it could happen anytime in our world today. If I was a parent, I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library. Finally, during this debate, older or more dirty - minded people will counter - argue this topic. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples? Those are some of the questions you will hear from those who counter what I've written today. Adults should be allowed their own personal section for adult - like books, movies, or magazines. Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them. In conclusion, those who counter - argue could be on the winning side, however, I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers all around the world want entertainment, but in good ways. The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way. Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and non - influential books from libraries. Let's make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, younger children will become more educated and grow up in a more positive literary environment.
1626	4603	2	3	READING OUR BOOKS Our book and movies can be extremely scary and unnecessary, with excessive violence and disturbing content. For young kids, scary books and movies will give them @ORGANIZATION1 nightmares. Books like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are excellent choices for teenage kids. @ORGANIZATION1 teaches them about the past and what it used to be like. As a parent, you need to make sure your kids watch the right shows and movies and also focus on the important ones. Hitler treated people so horribly that he killed countless individuals. I think it's a valuable lesson for kids to watch movies about him and read the related books. Also, I believe @CAPS1 is a great book because both girls and guys should know that forcing something on someone is completely wrong. Young kids should never have to endure such situations. She called for help, but no one could hear her. She was physically and mentally abused, and no one would listen to her. It was truly unjust. She never spoke up, but you could tell she was in pain just from the way she looked and her quiet demeanor. Movies like these should teach kids to never mistreat another person. Parents, keep an eye on your kids, watch what they read, and always be cautious about what your kids are doing. Give them books that will educate them. In conclusion, it's crucial for parents to guide their children's media consumption to ensure they gain positive and educational experiences.
1627	4604	2	3	What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knowledge? I firmly do not believe that certain materials should be removed solely because someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the undeniable right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows broader access to knowledge, it provides more accurate and realistic details about life, and it keeps them from being isolated from the world around them. We simply cannot deprive children of such essential opportunities. First of all, all children and students at schools across the country should have unrestricted access to more knowledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they are effectively blocked from accessing that type of learning. What if a student has a genuine interest in learning more about how government and politics work by reading an article? But then, the article is removed because of one minor comment within it. We cannot suppress our natural aspiration to learn more about the world. Secondly, it can offer a more accurate and realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more in - depth details about how things truly are in life. If that is taken away, they might develop a distorted understanding of how things really are and have unrealistic expectations. This could potentially have a significant emotional or psychological impact on them once they encounter the real world. They should be well - informed about what life is like in greater detail to avoid confusion when they reach that stage. Finally, they could be completely shut out from the world if everything is kept from them due to censorship. Being denied that kind of knowledge can be a heavy emotional burden. A friend of mine had over - protective parents who shielded her from many aspects of the world around her, preventing her from learning what she should have known. As she grew older, life became increasingly difficult for her. And now, she is afraid of many things in the real world. This is all because her parents used censorship to keep her in the dark about what was important. Our students should always have access to knowledge, detailed information about life, and not be kept from understanding things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational decisions about what we can and cannot access. And if censorship has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it itself censored? In conclusion, we must safeguard the right of students to access knowledge and oppose unnecessary censorship.
1628	4605	2	3	"Hello, I am Kristin, and I am here to tell you why we should remove some magazines from our public libraries. Now, I'm not sure if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have, and I used to read them. In some of those issues, there are explicit sex tips. Now, if I were a mother and my child ran up to me, pleading with me to let them check out that magazine, I would look at them and firmly say no. They don't need to understand sex until they are in their teens, at least thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldn't even be allowed to approach that kind of content; they should only be permitted in the children's section. Some parents think like me and agree that a child shouldn't learn about sex at a young age. But others are of the opinion that it's okay because they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married. There are also other things that need to be removed from a library. Some music might not be suitable for a young child. For example, rap music often contains a lot of cursing and explicit talk about sex. Some of the lyrics in a rap song, like ""shorty let me rind you like a hurricane"", are essentially equivalent to saying ""hey chick, let's do it for the heck of it"". That's not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to music that promotes positive activities, like ""hey, let's go outside and camp"" or ""duck duck goose"". Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as the content is appropriate, say not over @NUM1 in terms of rating. But if it exceeds that, they can't watch it. I'll give you another example. My little niece is probably around the age of ten or so. She watches @CAPS5 @CAPS6, but only when her parents are in the same room as her. She is not allowed to watch it by herself, or she will get grounded. This is why some of the inappropriate materials should be taken out of our public libraries to create a more child - friendly environment."
1629	4606	2	3	I believe that some materials on our library shelf are accessible to basically anyone in the world. I also think that the materials on that shelf can be removed, as long as they are promptly put back in their rightful spot, regardless of the circumstances. My experience with books isn't particularly extensive, but I do enjoy reading when I have some spare time. When I pick up a book, I carefully look at it and observe its features. That way, when I borrow it from the library, I'm certain that I want to read it and can appreciate the great aspects of the book. I'm not a very fast reader, but when I'm reading, I'm always eager to know how the book will end and how it begins. If I were to choose a magazine from the library, I wouldn't take it out because magazines can be quite expensive to obtain at times, and they are also difficult to replace if needed. But if I were to look at one, I would focus on the important information it contains, such as what it's about and how to access relevant resources. There are times when I think movies shouldn't be in the library because people could potentially take ideas from movies or even steal them. Movies in libraries would be costly to replace if they were taken out without permission. If I were to watch a movie from the library, I would savor it as much as possible because once the due date arrives to return it, there's no chance of watching it again. Music is a passion for most people. Many people would simply go out and buy CDs or other music - listening options. There are certain types of music that I listen to so that I can get inspiration if I ever want to become a musician. Sometimes, I'll write down the lyrics of a song so that I can better understand what the singer is singing about, or I'll listen to the song repeatedly. My point is that if something is taken off the shelf, it should be returned to its proper place. Otherwise, there will be consequences, and people will gradually lose the trust of the library. In conclusion, maintaining the proper circulation and return of library materials is essential for a well - functioning library system.
1630	4607	2	3	Do you think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsibility for what they offer to people? Many people think they should. But I strongly disagree. If someone doesn't want to learn about a particular topic, they simply don't have to read the related book. Public libraries are an invaluable asset to the community. They are especially helpful for children who don't have access to certain materials at home. Libraries do take into account what information children view. That's why there are restricted areas for children of a certain age. Also, it's not solely about what the library displays; parents also play a crucial role in allowing their kids to read things they are not supposed to read. What might be offensive to some people may not be so to others. People will always have diverse points of view. This valuable information cannot be removed because it might be extremely important at some point in our lives. All knowledge is helpful in one way or another. The vast amount of knowledge our libraries possess should not be taken away just because someone wishes to do so. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of access to knowledge in libraries and avoid unnecessary censorship to ensure the community can fully benefit from the resources available.
1631	4608	2	3	Libraries are filled with hundreds of diverse materials that many individuals (@CAPS4) like and dislike. There are books on @PERSON1 and @CAPS1, @CAPS2. Those books are not @CAPS3 there to offend you; they're there to educate you on the subject. Censorship should be only for the youth. As an adult, you are open to everything. You make your own decisions and live by them. If you feel like a book, a song, a movie, is offensive, then stop reading, listening, or watching. @CAPS3 everyone gets offended. I believe that no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of the @NUM1 - @CAPS3 every one is @NUM2 - @CAPS4 have different @CAPS2 and outlooks on @NUM3 - @CAPS5 the @CAPS6. I conclude this by saying that censorship is enforced, but shouldn't be to a great extent. Let @CAPS7 us do what we do, and learn what we learn. In school, we're forced to learn what we learn. I believe we have the @CAPS5 right to have outside knowledge, but the only way that is possible is that we get it from databases such as computers, books, music, art, etc.
1632	4609	2	3	Libraries are places of learning. Books, magazines, movies, and all types of media are carefully placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and explore. When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information that we came there looking for. Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn about a type of flower or researching the infamous 'In @CAPS1 @CAPS2', we want the truth and information in its rawest form. Materials should never be denied from the library. It always has some kind of value. Whether it be for cultural, spiritual, entertainment, or whatever kind of purpose, books can serve as a purpose for information and exploration into a new world. Books that are viewed as 'censored', are only being viewed from one narrow standpoint. Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for. If someone sees a book as 'offensive' they must step into another person's shoes and see where they are coming from; where this type of information @MONTH1 be helpful to someone else. Touchy issues such as the @CAPS3 or books to do with religion @MONTH1 be considered censored, but that's only concerning one group of people. What about the other percentage? Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitimate cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library. From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out. So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out. If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They are allowing their children to be exposed to this. And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw. Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone. These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession. None should be denied. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing.
1633	4610	2	3	The problem in this situation is that, some people feel like some things shouldn't be in the library. I don't believe that some things that are on the library shelves should be taken off. I think that because everyone has a different kind of 'offensive' for their families. One family might be okay with their child watching certain movies, listening to different kinds of music, and reading different genres of books. If you took them off then people wouldn't be able to express things the way they want to. Plus, the library would lose service because people would begin to realize that some particular library(s) have restrictions on stuff that they have on their shelves, so they wouldn't want to go there if they're going to be let down on something that they're looking for. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection to meet the varied needs of their patrons.
1634	4611	2	3	What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? Every year tons of @CAPS1 visit libraries in search of a good book, through acts of observations and personal appeal. Everyone has a different choice in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non - offensive material. Being a teen, I've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many I choose to ignore it. Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple. Everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as well as personal life experiences. Because everyone has different life experiences, there come different views on what offends them or not. Personal experiences I've had in the library are from race. Seeing books that relate to the days of slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to me. But, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else. So, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people? Books have different tones whether it's on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. I've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book. Where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible. Take a magazine for instance. One reader could look at that beautiful woman in that magazine and feel great about themselves. While maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like they're not beautiful or self - worthy as the woman in the magazine. That overweight woman could feel offended, while the other woman feels amazing. Because of that simple reason, it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't. Everyone reads books due to their liking and what relates to them. If a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it. When I come across material in a library that is offensive to me I won't read it. Although I have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive. In response, I simply returned the book and chose another one. If I walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me I wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf; I would simply ignore it. Everyone has different views on what offends them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and let offensive materials stay in the library for those who may find value in them.
1635	4612	2	3	In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a strict society, owning a book would result in receiving a severe punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away. A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n - word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature. '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with. Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning. We should not let the potential for offense lead to the removal of valuable literary works.
1636	4613	2	3	To the newspaper edits, should books, music, movies, magazines, and other reading materials be removed if the materials are viewed to be offensive? I firmly believe that is not a good idea. Just as @PERSON1, an accomplished Author, said in the last sentence, if we remove books from shelves, there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. This is undeniably true because I'm certain there are numerous books that might be offensive to some people, but perhaps the readers who take offense simply do not understand the materials they're reading. For instance, the topic of same - gender relationships has become a point of contention. Maybe the readers who are offended by such topics just don't understand or fail to grasp the underlying concepts. Another reason is that we are in America, and as far as I know, we have the free will to write and talk about what we desire. It's fair to say this because it's an established fact that people of all @CAPS1 @CAPS2 have the 'right' to express what's on their minds. Just because the topic of a reading material offends someone doesn't mean you can take away the writer's work. Doing so is like silencing the writer. If the reader has the right to voice their thoughts, then what's the meaning of being free to write what one wishes? It takes a great deal of restraint not to talk to a teacher or someone in a higher position when you don't understand something, and then being told 'you can't ask me that' or 'don't say a thing to me'. It's the same when you remove a book from the writer. Other reasons to oppose removing the reading material are that as humans, we're always eager to learn something new through exploration. When a person reads, they always pick up something new, like a new event, an unknown place, grammar, different writing styles, or more knowledge about a topic. Exploration in books, music, movies, and magazines is an excellent way to learn new things. It's enjoyable, and what could be better than learning in a fun way? It's hard to think of anything because exploration plays a significant role in our lives. Another reason not to remove the reading materials is that it might make other readers feel less alone. Consider a true story about a breakup, either of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story based on something that happened to the writer, like the death of a loved one and how to cope with it. Imagine two @CAPS4 girls. One is angry at herself and the world and hates a tape about angels. The other just lost her grandmother, and listening to the tape about angels makes her feel whole, knowing that her loved one is in a good place. If you take away a material like a small tape from the library's shelf, you're taking away a feeling, not only from the writer but also from the readers. Finally, the last reason not to remove the materials from the shelves is that if you remove the material, the topic is still out there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on @ORGANIZATION1. Can you delete all of that? It's not realistic. And even if it were possible, which is highly unlikely, people can still talk. There's nothing that can stop people from talking. 'You can lock a bird in a cage, but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away, but when you turn around, it's gone'. These are examples of what I'm trying to say. You can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dislike is still present. I understand that reading some materials might offend you, but it's better to just ignore it and move on. You might not like the topic, but others would, and that's always worth considering. Maybe the problem is that you don't understand the topic, so you should read it to learn and give it a chance. You might end up liking it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines are out there for a reason, and they can teach you something new, so why not learn from them?
1637	4614	2	3	Offensive articles, movies, magazines, and other such materials should not be pulled from shelves. If individuals choose to read and/or watch the material, that is their personal choice. However, @CAPS1, I firmly believe there should be an age limit for the material. If individuals find the material offensive, they should simply turn away and not read or watch the programs.  If the items are in a public library, they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them. They should not be left out in the open where small children or people who do not wish to see them might come across them. This way, the library can still accommodate different preferences while protecting the sensibilities of certain groups. Historic material such as diaries and accounts of events should be held at federal libraries. Having these documents in a public library could pique the interest of small children in reading things that are inappropriate for them. Some items like magazines, newspapers, and books are held at a public level. However, government - affiliated documents, such as parts of history and important documents, should be held at a federal library. High - profile documents like the constitution should be stored in high - security areas to ensure their safety and proper handling. In conclusion, people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so, as I've previously stated. But it shouldn't be accessible to small children. It should be kept in a separate area. If people don't want to view this material, they simply avoid that area. Having an age limit in place for this material is crucial so that small children don't view it and get the wrong message. The distribution of certain documents between public and federal libraries is also an important factor. Certain historical documents and other items affiliated with the government should be held at a federal level, along with important documents related to the country. These documents should be stored in high - profile, secure areas to safeguard their integrity and ensure they are available for appropriate research and viewing.
1638	4615	2	3	Communities are home to many different types of people. Certain groups of people find some things offensive, while others consider them completely normal. These differences often lead to conflicts. A library, for example, is one place where you might encounter some of these conflicts. Most libraries are open to the public. As a result, many different groups of people will be sharing the library's materials, such as books, movies, magazines, and music. In an attempt to please everyone, libraries must stock a wide variety of materials. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to satisfy all patrons, some people might find some of the material offensive. So, the big question is: Should material that some find offensive be removed from the shelves altogether? The answer is no. Libraries must have a diverse range of materials to meet the needs of everyone in the community. People are different and have different beliefs. Just because one person finds a certain type of material offensive doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone. Take religion, for example. Someone might find a book on a particular religion offensive, but others might strongly believe in that religion. Just because one person takes offense doesn't mean those who don't should be deprived of the material. Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries removed any material that anyone found offensive in any way, there would be hardly any material left. People have different beliefs, and that's the way it has always been and will likely continue to be. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their diverse collections. The materials are there for a reason, and they should be accessible to those who want to engage with them. If someone finds a particular item offensive, they can simply choose not to use it. By keeping the materials on the shelves, libraries can ensure that all members of the community have the opportunity to explore and learn.
1639	4616	2	3	I think the censorship in libraries is quite abominable. I firmly believe there should be no censorship. It is the responsibility of the parents to decide what their children can and cannot watch. If something is found offensive, the simple solution is to not watch it. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then you should take the necessary steps to prevent it. What I find truly offensive is when something is removed from the shelves. I think kids, especially those @NUM1 and above, should have the right to watch and listen to what they want. Certain things that some people find offensive are only offensive to a particular group. It might not be offensive to someone else, so there's no reason to take that particular movie or song out of libraries. A prime example of this is the book, To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries because of its vulgar words and references to rape. I think that's unfair because, whether we like it or not, children @NUM1 and over will definitely hear rude and offensive things in the real world. I believe that books, movies, or music that contain curse words are a part of life because most adults use curse words. Taking those things away from a library means taking them away from adults as well as kids. It's up to the parents to decide when, or if, their kids should hear these things. I also think that using 'offensive' remarks is just another aspect of our history. Take To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4 for example. Back in that time, it was common for black people to use slang and for men to curse when angry. That's just how people were and are. Taking those things off the shelves won't protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have the right to hear it if they want, and their parents have the right to allow them. I find it pointless that songs have words bleeped out over the radio because teenagers will know what they say anyway. Banning books is not a wise thing to do because it just makes kids more curious and want to hear the words even more. Basically, we have the right to hear and read those things. Removing the things we have a right to access is taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want their children to read or hear such things, they need to closely supervise what their kids read or listen to. Singling out a particular book or song is just as absurd as singling out all books and songs. In conclusion, we should oppose unnecessary censorship and let parents take charge of guiding their children's media consumption.
1640	4617	2	3	Everyone has come across something offensive in their life. However, different people find different things offensive. There are numerous topics that can trigger offense, such as race, religion, gender, etc. If you find a book offensive in a public library, I don't think it should be removed. Removing it just because one person doesn't like it isn't fair to everyone else who visits the library. It might be offensive to you, but to another person, it might not be. There could be many reasons for a book to be in the library. It could assist someone in writing a paper, learning about a subject, or conducting research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines, movies, or any other item in a library were removed every time one person found it offensive, there would hardly be any materials left in the library. I firmly believe that all books should be kept in the library, even if one person finds it offensive. Just because one person is offended doesn't mean it's fair to deny others the opportunity to check it out. If the concern is about what children might learn from the book if they check it out, that's the parents' responsibility for not supervising their children's choices. The child might actually learn something new from the book. Even if a book, movie, magazine, music, etc. is offensive, you can still learn from it. Reading the book could change your mind about the topic. It might also help other people change their minds by presenting new opinions about the topic that they've never considered before. One situation where a book, movie, magazine, music, etc. would be removed is if everyone agreed that it should be. If every single person who comes to the library is offended by it, then it would be in the library's best interest to get rid of that item. The main point here is that all the books in the library should remain on the shelves. The author wrote the book for a reason, and it should be available to those who want to read it. If one person doesn't like it, they should simply choose not to check it out. If we removed items every time someone found them offensive, there would be very little left in the library. Even if something is offensive to you, it could be useful to someone else. In conclusion, libraries should preserve their collections and let patrons make their own choices about what to engage with.
1641	4618	2	3	"To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 and I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I firmly do agree that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. If they are not something that the kids should learn about, then there's no reason to put them on the shelves. Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read are unfortunately a cause of a great deal of violence and threatening behavior. That's a major concern these days, and we all want a calm and peaceful world.  Often, we see teens and children getting into fights or using bad language towards others. It's truly not a good sight, and it's mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show filled with negative things, reading a book with inappropriate content, or just trying to act cool. If we could replace them with more important learning books, movies, and such, there would be less aggression in the world. Having a more positive day and going out and saying ""I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life"" would be the most wonderful thing to hear.  Teaching something that a kid could remember or that is helpful in the long run is truly the greatest thing. Knowing that they are engaging in something educational is just an amazing feeling. Now, when do we actually see kids doing what they are supposed to? Rarely, because they are too busy looking for trouble to get into. That's really not good for them, and they should always learn about the good things that can help them in life. It's a tough world out there for these kids, and they should be taught in the best way possible. So, let's make the necessary changes to the shelves for their betterment."
1642	4619	2	3	Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be promptly removed from the shelves if they are found offensive! After all, it's a public library. The majority of people would not like to come across something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way.  Libraries are places where people come in with the expectation of enjoying something, whether it's a well - written book, an interesting movie, or an informative magazine. When people visit the library looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding useful tips and not being disappointed. For example, stumbling upon something possibly about someone being racist is a huge letdown to many. No one should have to walk into a library and find something that offends them. It's simply not fair.  Now, let's consider parents with children. Would you like for your child to go into a library where they can look wherever their little heart desires and then come upon porn or anything that would be a bad influence on them? I highly doubt it. Unless, of course, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days. But for those who want their child to have a good education, you surely understand my point.  It's just not fair to the people who go to a library expecting to be satisfied but instead are let down. It does them no good, and it could also make your community look bad. Libraries are meant to help people with information, fun facts, and all - around good resources. So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc., away to maintain the integrity and purpose of the library.
1643	4620	2	3	I believe censorship is a good thing, but only to an extent. I think that censorship is closely related to an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is twelve years old and under, then the consumer should buy the censored books and other products. However, if you are thirteen and above, you should be able to buy products uncensored.  Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from the essence of that particular thing. Take music, for example. A lot of people get really angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored. It doesn't allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is trying to send.  With books, people get upset because they cannot grasp the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away a crucial part of a masterpiece. Some books should indeed be censored, like many romance novels. Those often get pretty graphic and go into a great deal of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the open shelves.  In the case of magazines, it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a political magazine, those magazines usually do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine, then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them.  Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3, those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4, they do not censor the movies because those are dedicated movie channels. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present), @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult, and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are suitable for any age group.  All in all, censorship really depends on what age group the consumer is in. If you are still in elementary school, you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products. If you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult. And if you are sixteen and older, you should be able to buy the products uncensored without an adult present because you should know you can handle the 'offensive' material. So, a balanced approach to censorship based on age is the way to go.
1644	4621	2	3	Books, music, and movies are all extremely important, especially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then a chain reaction might occur, and soon the book shelf will be almost empty. The same logic applies to movies, magazines, music, etc. Even though some parents do not approve of their young children reading or watching uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' crucial role to supervise their children, choose appropriate materials for them, and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch.  Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards. These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is ultimately the parents' decision to determine the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their children have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have taken all the necessary steps to ensure complete safety for the society.  If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contains an offensive thing, we would practically have to remove almost everything. People have diverse cultures and beliefs. What one person might think is offensive, another person might consider normal.  In the current society, a lot of people are more attracted to movies or music that contain some inappropriate materials because these materials have recently become prevalent in the media. We can't stop the production of such materials, but we can censor them. Different channels like the Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can't blame anyone other than themselves if their children read or see unacceptable materials.  Libraries should stay the way they are currently and maintain their existing way of censorship without any change. Parents need to have full - fledged supervision over their children. Libraries already have enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the person's age. By working together, we can ensure a safe and educational environment in the library.
1645	4622	2	3	I think there should be appropriate censorship in libraries for those who don't like, or are not comfortable with, what is on the shelf. No one should have a problem going to the library or taking their children there.  A public library is a place visited by children of all ages, sizes, and races. If I took my child or children to a public library, I definitely don't want to worry about whether or not my child will read or view something they shouldn't or that they don't like.  Censorship in libraries can strike a balance. It can protect the innocent minds of children from being exposed to inappropriate content while still allowing access to a wide range of knowledge. By carefully curating the materials on the shelves, libraries can ensure that they are suitable for all patrons. This way, parents can feel more at ease when bringing their children to the library, and everyone can have a positive and educational experience. So, let's implement proper censorship in libraries for the well - being of all its visitors.
1646	4623	2	3	In my lifetime, I have visited numerous libraries across different cities. I have also seen many different categories of books, such as comedy, fiction, non - fiction, drama, and so on. As we all know, there are many topics out there that are not suitable for minors or may not be appropriate for many other age groups. Movies in this day and age often reveal too much for our eyes. For example, in some modern cartoons, there is sexual content like explicit kissing scenes. Some parents don't want their children exposed to this kind of activity yet. Movies sometimes put false beliefs in people's minds about the way things are, will be, or the way one should perceive them. However, there are also some good movies available in libraries, such as documentaries, historical films, biographies, and etc. These give us good insights into how things were in the past and how they are now. Another topic is magazines. There are strange things going on in the world that adults should be aware of, which is why we put them in magazines. But children have easy access to them in libraries. The pictures that magazines have are sometimes images that should only be placed in certain restricted magazines. As there are bad aspects, there are also good things that come from magazines. Magazines are, in some ways, just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information, like health tips and lifestyle advice. Music is also a big topic that is placed in libraries. Some of the language that is on CD tracks is good, BUT there's a lot of bad material on them as well. So many well - known artists, known as rappers, say some very harsh and profane words that many adults and children just shouldn't want to hear. Like I said before, as there is bad, there is also much good. We have gospel, jazz, classical, and pop music that many people enjoy listening to. In conclusion, there are many good things that belong in libraries, but also many bad. Libraries, in my opinion, should take more caution on what people have access to. It's very easy for a young child (that can read) to pick up an adult book, go sit in a corner, read it, and be exposed to most things that parents are exposed to. So, in my opinion, yes, certain things should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.
1647	4624	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, firmly believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some individuals, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, strongly believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is clearly evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions in literary works must be upheld, and it would take away the opportunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader. The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This fundamental right belongs to all citizens of the United States, and shouldn't be taken away just because one person might think something is offensive. I have often observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from others, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship would dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The Catcher of the Rye.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, J.D. Salinger's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly throw a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across. If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it. This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the opportunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the censorship of literary materials in libraries should be firmly opposed.
1648	4625	2	3	Dear Mr. Smith, news paper editor. Pulling a book, cd, dvd/vcr tape, magazine, etc., because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a cowardly move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is truly disgusting. And yet, the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this harsh reality. If I have not convinced you otherwise, please keep reading. I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library, they should just leave it alone, and stay in their comfort zone of reading selections. If they are offended, they can go to read somewhere else. I understand that people might have been there first. If that is the case, well then, nicely ask the person/persons offending you to move somewhere else. The world is not a perfect place by any means. The world does have its positives, for instance, the United Nations, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (N.A.T.O.), but for some reason, the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them. That means that they decided to strip the libraries all over the world of the offensive and obscenities in all the books so that way boredom and an illusion of perfection could slowly but surely set into the world's minds to be okay. Well, I refuse to let it set into my mind, and I hope you choose the same for yourself. Yours sincerely, John Doe.
1649	4626	2	3	Reading is something that people actively choose to do for various reasons, including their own entertainment, for pure enjoyment, to gain personal knowledge, and many other valid motives. Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has a genuine interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I firmly believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done. For a person to be able to take away another person's right to read a book of his or her choice is truly mind - boggling. I know that some books can be quite descriptive and graphic, but these boundaries should be set within a home environment. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book, they shouldn't take it out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else. If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like. That is why there are many diverse sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery, which keeps you on the edge of your seat, to romance, which warms your heart. So, find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way, you are happy and so is everyone else. Libraries are places that people visit to check out and read books. Usually, a person chooses a book because of an eye - catching cover or because a friend has recommended it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves, then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books, but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to. Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes, or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilege of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one person's opinion.
1650	4627	2	3	I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need any more reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read. If the media is offensive, then someone's feelings will undoubtedly get hurt. I remember a specific time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive descriptions about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which, in a lot of cases, isn't true. But I remember people who read it and they believed every single word of it. Those people now rudely look down on the homeless. So, why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books. There is a lot of offensive music too. Today, most of the popular songs people listen to are offensive, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, because anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, because they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay. Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inappropriate stories. So, to really protect everyone and anyone, they need to really go through the magazine carefully and make sure it's not offensive at all. The media that I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay or not are definitely movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and they should ask themselves if they are appropriate. I think libraries should only have family - oriented movies. This way, nobody is harmed by anything they will view. In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try to stop anybody from getting harmed. By being more vigilant, libraries can create a safe and inclusive environment for all their patrons.
1651	4628	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Many individuals will answer this question in diverse ways. I firmly feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries. Allowing censorship in libraries is a blatant intrusion of our rights. It blatantly contradicts the fundamental freedom of the press. If someone desires for their opinion to be read, they should inherently have that right. I also strongly feel that censorship in libraries goes against the freedom of speech. After all, what is writing, but written speech? If someone wants to say something, they should be able to express it freely. If a mute person wants to convey a point, they should be able to do so by writing. What some people @MONTH1 consider offensive, others @MONTH1 not. If someone finds it offensive, they should simply choose not to read it. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place of free access to all forms of knowledge and expression, without the constraints of censorship.
1652	4629	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. This quote truly sums it all up. If everybody had their say in what is offensive or not, then everything would end up being labeled as offensive. Books are often written for the pure enjoyment of the reader, and if not, they serve informational purposes. Not everybody will share the same views of one book as someone else does. So, it would be grossly unfair to not be able to read a book because someone else doesn't want you to. Personally, I like to read books that genuinely interest me, as I can assume most other people do as well. Generally, to keep my attention, I prefer to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot. I realize that some people would find this offensive and not suitable for children. But I consider myself a well - behaved kid now, and I am not negatively affected by those books I read. When I was a kid in @NUM1 grade, I read a book far beyond what most @NUM1 graders read. This book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but I was mature enough to handle them. Just the other year, the librarian, whom I stay in regular contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf. I told her no, with my reason being that I found it to be a very captivating book! I would have been extremely upset to see a great book no longer be accessible because of some vulgar language, because in the end, they are just words that express strong emotion. Many books such as the dictionary or encyclopedias are used for informational purposes. These books can also be accessed by children. I myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'. Does that make it justifiable to remove? Even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them. When I was a freshman in high school, my @CAPS1 teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved. She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very engaging read for her and her students. Books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some overly - strict adults think it is offensive, when in reality, they teach great morals and lessons for the youth. If you take a look at politics, you can see that not everybody has the same opinion, and some can be very vocal about theirs. The same idea applies to any topic in the world today. Somebody thinks one way, and someone else thinks the complete opposite. This is the problem with taking books off the shelves. One person thinks it is a very offensive book, and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. My personal opinion is that a book is a book, and people are going to interpret them differently. So, if one book can get taken off the shelves, then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone. There is no point! If someone shouldn't read that book, then they simply shouldn't be allowed to. In conclusion, we should preserve the diversity of books in libraries and not let over - sensitivity lead to the loss of valuable literary works.
1653	4630	2	3	Have you ever walked into a library and spotted a book that you wouldn't want your child or any young one to pick up and read? There are several books in the library that are suitable for young children to read. I don't believe that a certain book should be removed from the library just because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children. However, there are a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possible things that could be done are: move those books to a higher shelf, designate a certain area for those books, or put an age limit on those books. The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your child's, or any other child's hands is to move those books to a higher shelf. Doing this will effectively keep those books out of your child's sight and reach. That will prevent them from getting their hands on those books and reading them. The next possibility to keep offensive books out of your child's or any child's hands is to designate a specific area for those books in the library. Doing this will create a 'barrier', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area and keep a close watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. You would also know exactly where those books are, so you could ensure they don't venture to that area. The final possibility to keep offensive books out of your child's or any other child's hands is to put an age limit on those books to keep the children from being able to check - out those books to read them. This would require the children to be a certain age before they can check them out, thus preventing them from reading those books. These are a few possible solutions that could be used to keep offensive books out of children's hands and prevent them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them to get a hold of and read. In conclusion, these measures offer a practical way to balance access to all books in the library while protecting children from inappropriate content.
1654	4631	2	3	Many people hold different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc. that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers, and that the creators should limit their writing on certain things or avoid them altogether. Other people believe that people have the right to say what they want, when they want, on a topic they believe to be true or not true, or very important to them, which is also known as freedom of speech. Also, people recognize that yes, there are some things written out there that perhaps should not have been written, but they have no control over it, and to some people, it @MONTH1 be appropriate. I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers, and movies were in libraries, then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could be beneficial to certain people and be of interest to them, no matter what the subject is or how inappropriate it @MONTH1 be, as long as they are of the right age. If the story is simply about drugs, sex, alcohol, and violence with really no redeeming value, then yes, I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You never know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid, and we don't want to expose them to such content. People have many different beliefs, and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone. But I also do believe there is a certain limit. In conclusion, finding the right balance between freedom of expression and protecting the public, especially children, from inappropriate content is crucial.
1655	4632	2	3	@CAPS1 happened to using books and films as simple entertainment? Why are we now so cautious about @CAPS1 our children pick off the shelf? Society today has transformed the way we once regarded our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with suspicion, and once - harmless movies and magazines are full of material that no one should be reading or watching. Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, @CAPS1 do you hear? Mindless jumbles of words linked together with curses and other trash. Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment? There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who adored reading and listening to music. She was bright but shy, and she used books as her companions. Each day she walked to the library for a new story to immerse herself in. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. The book looked well - used, for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly falling out. She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind was exposed to a world she didn't know. After reading the book, she was filled with a sense of guilt. It wasn't a good book, but one that was laced with a harmful message. This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know. So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort? The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely intended for the piece of literature to be enjoyed with a light - hearted attitude. However, the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is quite different. When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet, the real question is: @CAPS1 about our children? How do we keep them safe from offensive literature? And @CAPS1 about music? Or movies? Remember the old black and white films? How, no matter @CAPS1 the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black. Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message. @CAPS1 about the other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form of racism, and/or sexual content. Personally, going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be a fun experience, but where does the fun stop? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a private moment that should be kept that way? And @CAPS1 happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep these sorts of material away from them? Libraries should exercise major caution when printing labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc. Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them unavailable to certain age groups. Parents should also be cautious when letting their child go to the movies with friends. Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message. Should libraries take certain material off their shelves? I don't think so. However, be careful @CAPS1 you read or watch, for it might not meet your expectations. Use the internet as a source to find reviews on books and magazines to see how well it was rated and then decide whether it is an interesting read or an amazing film. Have fun, but be vigilant. In conclusion, while we should not overly restrict access to media, we must take steps to protect the vulnerable, especially children, from inappropriate content.
1656	4633	2	3	Books, magazines, and music should be removed if they have something offensive to a person or a child. Such media can cause children or adults to have a vivid imagination and might make them think that inappropriate behavior is acceptable. All these things that are not for proper use should be disposed of where no children or adults can access them. I believe that this kind of content can harm people as they grow up or make adults think it's the right way to act. Books and music should be removed if they are not used for something beneficial. Books and magazines that have no useful material and are used for pornography or other inappropriate content should be taken off the shelves. Kids and adults have active imaginations, which could sometimes lead them to hurt others, including family members. Books, magazines, and music are meant to provide inspiration, not to be a source of distraction. Sometimes, without realizing it, people hurt their loved ones because of what they see, read, or hear. This can have the biggest impact on people. If the supplies like books, magazines, and music you get are not helpful and are causing more problems in your life, they should be removed from the markets. Also, people sometimes decide to buy them because of the appealing pictures. Another reason for taking them off the shelves is the negative influence one can get from looking, hearing, and reading. These are all bad things for anyone to read or listen to. I believe that books, magazines, and music that are not good for the brain and don't help in any way should be taken off. Things that are not used for good are not useful. In my opinion, trashy books and music can sometimes lead a person to suicide or make them do something crazy that they will later regret. This is why none of those things are useful for a person or a child. In conclusion, I think that books, magazines, and music that are not useful should be taken off the shelves and replaced with things that help the mind. Things that are not resourceful for a person's mind should be put away. All these issues can lead to instability in life and wrong steps that result in failure. Finally, I think that all unresourceful books, magazines, and music should be put away.
1657	4634	2	3	I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. First, you have to carefully consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the ones to determine if it should be censored or not. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable. Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. Some people may not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong. It is either your own responsibility or a parent's responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. So most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books and movies because those things are already in your life. It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age. The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastrous. The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove. I once read To Kill a Mockingbird, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devastating. You should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive. Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own responsibility to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music, and magazines. It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture.
1658	4635	2	3	Censorship in libraries is good in some ways. People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books. Things that offend people include, for instance, a book about Native Americans and how they were treated so poorly. But almost anything nowadays offends people, and it's ridiculous. Either way, there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive. My experience with this situation didn't really bother me. But I was in a library glancing through a book, and I read a paragraph that had the word 'nigger' in it, and I found it a little offensive. That word is just really not nice. People like different books, movies, magazines, etc., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well, I'm pretty sure some people find them offensive in some way. What some might find offensive, others might think differently. Like in magazines, my aunt finds them offensive because of the bathing suit models in them for advertising a new swimsuit or for advertising liquor. All together, just about everything is offensive to someone out there. If all the things that people found offensive were to be removed, then there would hardly be any books, movies, etc., and not only that, it would be a real letdown. In conclusion, while censorship has its merits, an over - zealous approach to removing offensive materials would severely limit the available resources in libraries and deprive people of diverse content.
1659	4636	2	3	People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want. It is people's own choice to decide what they read, watch, or listen to. Others will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books. They will only go somewhere else and access that content. People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them. If others find that offensive, then that is their problem. People make their own decisions, and that is their right. I feel that if you tell someone that they cannot do a certain thing, that will only make them want to do it more. Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve the problem that our society has with being offensive to others; it will only mask it. Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others; they just won't do it in libraries. Every book, music, or movie will be offensive to some other person, and if we take all the offensive stuff out, there will be nothing left to read. It is just something that we will have to deal with. So I do not agree with censorship in libraries. It will not only take away our right to read and view what we want but also remove all the offensive movies and books we have, which is almost every book. Everyone feels that one book or another is offensive to them, and if we take away those books, we will have nothing left in our libraries. In conclusion, censorship in libraries goes against the principle of personal freedom and choice, and it is an ineffective way to address the issue of offensive content in society.
1660	4637	2	3	Censorship: No, I don't think they should take certain books off the shelves. There are a lot of things out there that can be found offensive, such as gangs, politics, race, and even the schools that small children attend. I can understand wanting to shelter your children, but you can't keep them from everything. In inner cities, gangs write awful words on trains, buildings, and just about anything they can. And you can't just remove that from the real - world environment. Politics can be the worst. During presidential elections, candidates always bring up each other's skin color and every negative thing they can find out about the other person. All of your kids watch this on TV. Race wars can get bad. People all around the world are fighting just because of the color of their skin. You can't shield them from it either. It's an ongoing battle that will never end and will keep getting worse. I can't speak for other schools, but mine has a lot of little problems. Little kids are cussing, the older kids are fighting, and then there are the students who try to do well in school and get picked on for it. You can't hide your kids forever. Sooner or later, they will find out about these problems. If you want to help your kids, keep them off the streets because reading about these issues in a book is a lot better than them experiencing them in the real world. You have to prepare them for the problems ahead. If you don't, they might get hurt a lot worse than by just reading a few little offensive words in a book, magazine, or movie. In conclusion, removing books from library shelves due to offensive content is not a practical solution as it won't protect children from the real - world problems they will eventually face. Instead, we should use books as a means to educate and prepare them.
1661	4638	2	3	In the book Fahrenheit 451, all books get burned regardless of what they contain, and the people are constantly sad and depressed about everything. Books are an important part of our lives. Some materials indeed need to be censored because they might offend people who are already struggling with their self - identity, and such offensive content could add fuel to the fire. However, there are some books that are being censored for little to no valid reason. There might be a single rude or misunderstood word that causes these books to be unnecessarily censored. Censorship is important to libraries when used correctly. We need books for various purposes, from learning new knowledge to simply passing the time. Music has accompanied mankind since the dawn of time. Movies show us the full spectrum of life's ups and downs. Magazines inform us about the latest and most interesting happenings. These things have become as essential to us as clothes and food. Simply removing them will make the world a much darker place to live. Some of these things can cause people to be offended without any intention. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me, then everyone could do the same, and soon all of the books would be gone. We can try to be kind to everyone, but at some point, something will insult someone no matter what we do or say. Do we really need to get rid of everything for that reason? In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship is needed to preserve the richness of our cultural and informational resources.
1662	4639	2	3	What is censorship? Many would say it's a book without cuss words or it's a movie without blatant racism. For me, I think censorship is covering up the truth. I don't think movies or books should be removed from the shelves just because some people find them offensive. When a book uses a cuss word to show intense anger or simply as part of natural language, I think that it's okay because that's what we commonly hear in the real world. Now I know some people may not have grown up hearing foul words, but many of us have been exposed to such language in our daily lives. With movies, I think that if parents have a problem with their children watching something bad or offensive, then they should take responsibility and not let their kids watch it. That's the problem with people nowadays; they don't want to take blame for things that go wrong in their lives. People use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like they're good parents or that the world owes them something. When it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone too far with race - related content, censorship gets brought up. Many people have issues with their race or nationality being misrepresented. It's ironic to see that a particular race may use those foul words among themselves, but when it's in a book, it's labeled as racism. Or when a certain race is being made fun of or portrayed in a movie in a way that makes that race uncomfortable, that movie is called racist. I feel that if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, then they should remove it from their own lives. Too many people try to control things through censorship. For years, people have wanted books read in school to be censored for bad language. Why spend so much time on censoring the books instead of addressing the language used in schools? I know kids in school use foul language all the time, often even worse than what's in the books we read. If adults would realize that it's their kids they need to guide and not just censor the books, then censorship wouldn't have become such a huge problem. People need to understand that censoring books or movies doesn't make offensive words or bad images disappear; it just covers them up. In conclusion, we should focus on education and personal responsibility rather than over - relying on censorship.
1663	4640	2	3	Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive? I don't think that is right. That's just the opinion of one person, and I'm sure other people won't share the same view. Just because one person believes something is offensive and should be removed from the shelf doesn't mean that a child couldn't learn valuable lessons from that book. Also, with music, movies, and magazines, these can be obtained easily elsewhere, so why is it such a bad thing to have them in a library? A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school projects. If people are taking away the books they require, then how are they supposed to complete their schoolwork? I'm sure there are people out there who would say that the books kids need contain content they shouldn't be learning yet, but we're going to have to learn about such things at some point, so why not now? Taking away music? Kids can simply get on the internet and access it just as easily, and most kids are doing it in ways that could land them in trouble. So having music at libraries is just providing them with a safe and free way to access it. Magazines can be bought at a store, but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to purchase them. So having them at libraries would give kids a chance to see and read them. As long as the content is suitable for kids, I don't see what's wrong with libraries having them. So I think taking books, music, magazines, and movies away from libraries isn't a very good idea. Maybe they could create an adult area in the library. If someone suggests that a book should go in that area, the library staff can review it and decide if it's appropriate. I can understand some materials being removed, but not a large amount. If you take away all these things from a library, then it won't really be a proper library anymore. In conclusion, libraries should strike a balance between providing diverse resources and ensuring content suitability.
1664	4641	2	3	I think if something is offensive, it should not be available for kids until they are old enough to read it or listen to it. I think such offensive materials need to be removed from the open shelves or put away in a restricted area. Because it can be hurtful and inappropriate for younger kids, and this potential harm could be prevented if these materials are removed from easily accessible shelves. I believe the magazines can be put away in a separate section or stored in a way that restricts young access. Music or movies could also be placed in their own dedicated sections, perhaps with age - appropriate signage. Internet access at libraries could be blocked for certain inappropriate websites. Fortunately, in the time we live in, there are adults who can prevent these things from negatively affecting kids. There are people who can monitor and tell kids that they are too young for that kind of content. So, I think it could be easily managed. Just put these offensive materials up or remove them from the open shelves. If something is offensive, remove it so that we don't have to worry about whether our children are reading or accessing it. In conclusion, proper management of offensive content in libraries can protect young minds.
1665	4642	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I would like to start off by saying that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are great resources for kids in libraries. It's wonderful that kids have a place to go during their free time when they have nothing else to do or when they need a quiet place to read. However, some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults. In high school, just walking down the hall, you will come across information that you'd probably rather not know. Many of these things may not be appropriate, and whenever you walk into the library, it sometimes seems as if they are promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex. Books about drugs are acceptable to a certain extent, like if they are about medicinal drugs and their proper use. But whenever they are talking about how drugs can take away pain and make everything seem better, that's when it's taken too far. Our kids and future generations do not need to be learning about these sorts of harmful ideas. Alcohol is the same case. You can see alcohol being glorified everywhere, and kids are starting to engage with it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc. are, in a way, promoting it. Our kids do not need to be learning about these things. Instead, we need them to learn about the real dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what to do when drunk. Advertisements are the worst things that kids could be exposed to, especially when they are on billboards, the fronts of magazines, etc. Kids do not need to be learning such inappropriate content at such a young age. Kids should be encouraged to play outside, participate in sports, have fun with their families, or go for a bike ride. I feel that these offensive things should be taken out of libraries if they are likely to cause discomfort to some people. Because maybe it's for the best that these materials are removed from the shelves, as our kids may be healthier and live longer without being influenced or pressured into doing drugs and alcohol. In conclusion, libraries should curate their collections to ensure a safe and positive learning environment for young patrons.
1666	4643	2	3	I am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries. Some people think that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive. Those things might be offensive to them, but different people have different sensibilities, so they may not be offensive to other people. So you have to look at it from not only your own point of view but also other people's points of view. I think they should not remove these things from the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view. For instance, my mom likes vampire books and movies, but I like tragedies. See, everyone likes something different. They also have to consider that the books we have from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM2, etc., are offensive to some people. Are we going to take those books out too? I mean, if we took books, music, movies, magazines, etc., out just because they are considered offensive, then we would not have many books, music, movies, magazines, etc. left. Everyone thinks something is offensive; some might think the same thing is offensive, while others might think something different is offensive. We should not take books, music, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelves. I understand that people do not want their kids to see or hear them. But it's part of life. You can't take everything out to please one person because it could make another person mad. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse views of library - goers and keep a wide range of materials on the shelves.
1667	4644	2	3	Libraries are normally a safe and quiet place for people to go, sit down, drink a cup of coffee, and read a book or magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of their favorite music. But, unfortunately, some people don't use it as such a peaceful haven. They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people who are trying to have some time to themselves, perhaps while their children are away or after having had a bad day and wanting to regroup and get ready for the next day. Then we might ask ourselves why do people want to sit at a library and read. Why can't they just check out a book, CD, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library? I don't see what the big deal is about this! Most counties have a public library, which means they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at their stuff. Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, providing personal information such as a telephone number, address, or credit card number. The letter would state that they have a certain amount of time with the book and they need to return it on a certain date. Otherwise, they need to bring it back and get it renewed so that no one can be accused of stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer. Most places have what they call late fees. Normally, if someone has a late fee, then they might not return the book because they don't want to pay it. So I feel that by getting their credit card number, the library can just keep charging their account and get the money for the late fees that way. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they receive in the mail from the library in the trash. I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never - ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care. Yes, the internet would be a little different because not everyone has the money to get the internet at their house. I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying. I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junky. My ideas, to me, are good ideas and I feel like we can put libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1. In conclusion, by implementing proper policies and using available means to collect late fees, we can improve the situation of book returns and make libraries more functional.
1668	4645	2	3	People find things offensive every day. It is just a part of life. Some people have a right to feel offended for some reasons, but they really can't control it from happening. It is just something that has occurred for thousands of years, and over time, people have slowly begun to deal with it. So, therefore, I believe that books and other materials that are found offensive should not have to be taken down just because they offend someone, because taking it down could offend someone else. What I'm really trying to get across is that no matter what, not everyone will be happy. Life is filled with a diverse society and a wide range of emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing. Also, it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material. After all, they did pay for it and have a right to let people in society watch, read, or listen to it. Thus being said, I believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum. Such as racism, it seems as though racism still impacts a large part of the country today and will forever be an ongoing matter in problems around the @CAPS1. In conclusion, the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive. As I said, everyone deals with offensive things at one point, and not everyone can be happy. Moreover, some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, etc., rather than being just racist or offensive as everyone often jumps to conclusions about. And everyone needs to get past the offensive side and reach a level where everyone can understand each other. For we are all the same at the core, but yet, still divided among looks and culture. We should view these materials with an open and educated mind.
1669	4646	2	3	The libraries are made for everyone, from children to adults. There may be some things that should not be in certain areas or even in the place at all. With libraries having books for all age groups, there may or should not be some material in those areas for them to see. Let alone, some material may not even be appropriate to be there to begin with. Any age of children can pick up a material that may contain either offensive content or just some things that they should not see. I think that libraries should only contain materials that are appropriate for all age groups. This is my opinion on why I think libraries should only have materials with appropriate images and words for all age groups. You don't know what your or someone else's child may pick up and read or hear. The best thing to do is to have all appropriate materials and nothing else. In conclusion, by ensuring that libraries are stocked with age - appropriate materials, we can create a safe and beneficial environment for all library visitors, whether they are children or adults.
1670	4647	2	3	Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to large groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries, there are libraries that hold offensive material. Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves. Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. Now all over the countries, libraries have offensive material that should be removed from their shelves. Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. Say there are materials that are not suitable for children, and they grab it and start reading. Next thing you know, your children will have that type of knowledge and you can't do a thing about it. Offensive material is around little kids, and parents don't even know. They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school, and that material could spread. Material like that at the library can harm children's brains by brainwashing them. Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regrettable. Teens often go to the library to meet up with friends or start on homework. Then an immature person spots a book and begins to read. After that, he or she thinks that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. Teens can be influenced by anything, and what's worse is that it can start at the library. Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. People like that are immature and could pose a real problem for the library. Once having that item in their grasp, they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. Offensive material could be easily stolen from a library. If these certain items were not at the library, then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library. Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. I don't want such a wonderful resource to be tainted by these obscene materials. That is why I strongly believe that certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from libraries will protect children, prevent negative influences on teens, and reduce theft, thus maintaining the positive and educational nature of libraries.
1671	4648	2	3	Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading might be offensive. Instead of removing the offensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive. These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. For example, when we watch the news, we often see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants. Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For instance, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they may later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it. There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an effective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be offensive. Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out beforehand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it. In conclusion, respecting people's ability to make their own choices and using proper warnings is a better approach than removing offensive materials from library shelves.
1672	4649	2	3	Censorship in libraries today, I believe, is not a big problem. But many would disagree with that. Books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age. They can give us facts about a certain topic that we may not find anywhere else. Everyone has their own definition of offensive. I believe that it is not only up to the library to rate the books, movies, and magazines as offensive but it is also up to the participants using these resources. For many kids, no matter what age, they only rent books from a library for two main reasons: pleasure and projects. To censor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see what's inside of it. For the people who do pleasure reading, they most of the time stick to only one type of genre. If someone wanted to rent a book, and it was not appropriate for them to read, then the librarian or teacher would restrict that book from them. For projects, such as for school, it would depend upon the librarian to censor the book to a child. But books are not rated such as movies are. So it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it. If they feel that it will not be appropriate for some, then they could give a suggestion to censor it. Movies and books are different in many ways. Books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading. Movies, on the other hand, create a visual image right in front of your eyes. No matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give, it still does not compare with the visual picture of a video. Movies are rated today as to the age of a person, and they say why they are rated as such. Movies rated above the PG - 13 level are most of the time not held in libraries. They may still be censored if they create too vile of an image, but that is up to the one who watches it. Music is a major part of each one of our lives, and without it the world would be a much different place. Everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music, and most of the time sticks to it. Music, like movies, is also rated by the content of the song. If it has a word or two that should be censored, then it is most likely already labeled 'explicit'. I think that music, just like movies, should not be able to be censored, because they are already rated accordingly. Some books, magazines, and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone. And even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present. Books can be a magical place for children, as well as adults, to go and create their own world. To censor a book, movie, or magazine would be taking away that chance for someone to enjoy life just a little bit more for that small moment in time. In conclusion, a balanced approach that considers the user's maturity and the nature of the material is more appropriate than strict censorship in libraries.
1673	4650	2	3	My opinion on this subject is it's not right. This is a very interesting question. And I'm going to tell you why I think the way I do. I'm for it and against it. Okay, some people like different things and the other people don't agree on it. That's how things work. If a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it, I would not want my kid to be around that and that's what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offended. I totally agree on that. Like cigarettes. Kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see. Once again, I would want to remove that from the shelves. There would be so many conflicts if this happened. Everyone likes different things. So I think everyone is going to get offended by taking things away that look offensive towards them. This goes from kids to adults. Every age would be bothered by this. Now this is my against view on this subject. This would make me very mad if I admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offended by it so they take it away from the people who like that object. All this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad. That's how it's supposed to be. We all have our opinions. We all like different things. We all have to get over it if we don't like it or don't get along with it. That's something we have to take in and suck it up. So on this subject, I'm for both. I see it both ways because it's good and bad. People are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear. It's part of life. In conclusion, finding a middle - ground between protecting the vulnerable and respecting individual preferences is essential when dealing with the issue of removing offensive items.
1674	4651	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found inappropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this. For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books. For example, say one library may have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action. If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores. Second reason being that kids would not get into these kind of books if it was inappropriate, unless they're given approval by parents. If these materials were to still be on shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read it, unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first. Sure it would make the library more kid - friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid only because of a few bad words. Lastly, some adults would be upset of the removal of some books. Some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library. If they were to remove these books, adults would then have to find a book online. So censorship, to me, is not going to make any difference. If this continues, it may lead so far, that the libraries would have to be closed. Take my word for it. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection of materials and use age - appropriate restrictions and parental guidance rather than removing inappropriate materials through censorship.
1675	4652	2	3	Censorship to most people means much more than the average three - syllable word. It means giving up the right to say and think however you want. To most, this idea is not a good one. When one is censored, they are essentially giving up the right of freedom of speech. In this essay I will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries. One reason censorship should not be allowed in libraries is the lack of freedom of speech. Decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was allowed to practice their right to speak freely, the idea of censorship was not in the plan. As Americans, it is our right to speak and write however we want without repercussions, however offensive or non - offensive the material may be. As Americans, all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another. Does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves? Absolutely not. Freedom of speech is our birth right and we should be allowed to say or write anything without being censored. '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson. Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book off the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone else also has that same right. As previously stated in the paragraph above, it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive. If that was the case, I could find ten books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person could find fifteen books that are offensive and so on. Just as Katherine states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelves for any of us.' And the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings. As an avid book reader, I couldn't even begin to describe all of the vocabulary words and new things I learn from reading one book. Just recently I read the book To Kill a Mockingbird. As I was reading, I began to have a deep hatred of the main character. Later I found that the book was incredibly offensive. However, from reading it, the book provided much insight into the 1930s' life that I knew nothing about. It gave me a great deal of information that to this day, I use. The book made me reflect on myself and how eighty plus years changes people, Americans more specifically. In conclusion, censorship in libraries undermines our freedom of speech, depletes the library's collection, and limits our learning and perspective, so it should not be implemented.
1676	4653	2	3	I think that every book in the world should be on the library shelf. After all, if a book is offensive, then simply don't read it. It is much better if you can freely choose to read any book you want. And if the library doesn't have that particular book, then you might have to go get it somewhere else. Some people wouldn't go through all that trouble for a single book. This means they won't gain as much knowledge as they desired or were capable of. We need smart people to reach their full potential and acquire as much knowledge as they wish and can possibly learn. Although not everyone is an avid reader, let's say you wanted to know something about a truck. What would you do? You'd go find a book about it, search online, or ask someone who knows. How would anyone know anything about the truck if the person who built it didn't write a book detailing its features? You'd have to take it apart and figure it out on your own, which isn't easy at all. And if you made a mistake, that wouldn't be good. But if you had a book to refer to, it usually makes things a lot simpler. This is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf. So that if you need to learn something, you can read about it and discover what you want to know. Reading is one of the best ways to obtain accurate information, ensuring that no one misleads you. Plus, books are just enjoyable to read. All movies should also be available because everyone has the right to watch any movie they want, unless they aren't of age and don't have parental permission. If a movie offends you, then don't watch it. Magazines are great too. I read a lot of magazines and you can find a wealth of information about anything in them. So, yes, they are beneficial. In conclusion, having a wide range of books, movies, and magazines available allows people to access knowledge and entertainment according to their own preferences.
1677	4654	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive? No, I do not. My opinion is that the diverse range of things found in our library is a good thing. Most of the materials offer very helpful information. Some people might dislike certain items due to their content, but a lot of it is part of history, and you can't change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magazine, they simply shouldn't read or watch it. I've found that the resources in our libraries are extremely useful for various projects. For example, if we need to learn about slaves or slavery, we can turn to the library. Some people may have different views on this, but we can't change the past. We can only learn from the mistakes made. I say if the cover of a book doesn't appeal to you, don't read it. Instead, look for something more interesting. I haven't found anything in our library that is offensive or bad to me. The library has books on every topic imaginable. Some content might seem negative, but mostly it's all valuable information. They cover history, guns, drugs, wars, and all sorts of historical events. There are even books about fictional things. I think people sometimes overreact. If you don't like a book or movie, don't pick it up. Just look at the cover. If it seems appealing, go ahead and get it. But if not, don't waste time complaining. Otherwise, things can get out of hand. That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc., in our libraries. Mainly, they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions. In the end, it's important to respect the variety of materials in the library and let individuals make their own choices.
1678	4655	2	3	I think there should be no books taken off the library shelves. Some things might be offensive to some people, but other people might need those books for research, projects, etc. People need to read to understand why some individuals find certain things offensive. Every book should be available on the shelves of a public library. Everyone has the freedom to make their own choices. Let them decide if a book is offensive to them or others. Maybe an author wrote a book about gangsters and their kids. Perhaps the author intended to give an inside look into someone's life. We live in a diverse world with different outlooks. The author could be showing what that child went through during a period filled with killings and violence. This shouldn't be considered offensive just because it involves such topics. Reading the book should allow you to see how the child grew up. It could even change the minds of some parents who are in gangs. It might make them realize the impact it will have on their child's future. I believe the same principle applies to movies and magazines. By reading magazines and watching movies, you can gain valuable insights. For instance, if you're in a gang and you read and watch relevant materials, you might learn what could happen to the gang and change your perspective. These books, movies, and magazines can show the consequences of certain actions. Maybe directors and writers create such content to illustrate the outcomes of being involved in gangs and harmful clubs. Why should certain people get to decide if a book, movie, magazine, etc., is offensive to some but not others? I think the best solution is to leave every book on public library shelves. Let the people who visit the library decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Even if libraries make a decision, someone is bound to be upset. There's no perfect way to solve this issue except to let people read and make their own judgments. If they like a book, great. If not, they can simply not read it again or return it. Nobody can determine right from wrong for someone else; only you can do that for yourself. In conclusion, maintaining the availability of all materials in libraries respects individual freedom and the potential for positive change.
1679	4656	2	3	Some children take books off the shelf that some elderly people can no longer read easily. Unfortunately, some individuals remove books from the library and damage them, such as tearing pages out. This behavior not only affects the availability of these books for others but also ruins the reading experience for those who might have wanted to use them. Libraries are places where people come to access knowledge and enjoy reading, and such actions undermine the purpose of these institutions. It's important that we encourage proper behavior in libraries and ensure that books are treated with respect. By doing so, we can preserve these valuable resources for everyone. In conclusion, we should take steps to prevent such damage and promote a culture of respect for library materials.
1680	4657	2	3	Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever come across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well, that should never happen. If a book or any other material is offensive, then it should be placed in a separate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section, there should not be any offensive or vulgar materials accessible to children or even early teenagers. Almost every day, children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have detrimental effects on them. Maybe if they don't encounter these offensive materials at a young age, they'll be less likely to engage in the behaviors they see or read about. For example, when teenagers read about people doing drugs, it could influence them to participate in such activities. The impact of these materials might not be immediate, but it could have a significant effect on them later in life. The youth is the future of our country. So, we need to do our part and keep offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I don't want my children to read some of the things I read when I was young. That's why I believe there should be censorship in every library. In conclusion, implementing appropriate censorship in libraries is crucial for protecting the well - being and development of our youth.
1681	4658	2	3	Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries, they have a vast amount of materials that contain language and images that are offensive. I have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if they censor stuff in a library, they should also censor TV. I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Every day, I see bad language that isn't censored. I also have seen images that are not censored. The youth of this time mostly watch TV rather than use the library. So, why not censor TV? I see things on TV that I won't see in a library. In my conclusion, I would like to say I don't believe that libraries should censor their materials because students will still find out. There are plenty of other places that are worse. Like crime scenes, crime scenes have blood and gore, and a library would just have language. These are my views, and yours could be different. We should consider a balanced approach to both library and TV content rather than singling out libraries for censorship.
1682	4659	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, a well - known author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books with inappropriate content should not be readily available on the shelves for children to read. I wholeheartedly agree with her on that statement. I have once read a book filled with very mature content. It was extremely vulgar and not suitable for my age or level of maturity. There are numerous books like that out there, and we need to safeguard the children of our society from such content. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other inappropriate things. If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves, our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregnancies, drug usage, and multiple other factors that are negatively affecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these books though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books, they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries. In conclusion, while respecting the rights of adult readers, we must prioritize the well - being of children by controlling their access to such materials.
1683	4660	2	3	We have all been to a library at some point in our life. Have you ever been looking around a library and seen something that might have been offensive, or something you didn't agree with? What if you had the chance to have it taken off the shelves for good? Or, what if someone else had the choice to? Would you allow them to do so? In my opinion, I would say no. Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves just because it might be offensive to them or their way of life. I say, if you do not like it, do not look at it; it is as simple as that. For example, what if you were into rap or the hip - hop culture, and someone finds that offensive? Would you give them the right to keep it from you? Or, would you really want to do that to someone else? Let's say you are a Christian, and an atheist finds the religious content offensive or untruthful, so he has it taken off the shelves. Does that sound fair to you? If someone was to not like a certain topic, culture, or finds it offensive, all they would have to do is simply stay away from it. The point is, if we all were to take something off the shelves, there would eventually be nothing left. We should respect what other cultures and ways of life are about and stay away from what offends us. Would you like someone to have what you like taken off the shelves? I would not, so you should not do that to other people. In a diverse society, respecting each other's choices in reading is essential for a rich and inclusive library environment.
1684	4661	2	3	It seems today we attempt to censor everything, but are we going too far? Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole? In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed the line. A library is, essentially, an incredibly valuable resource to each generation. In some cases, it still is, but when books are being withheld due to the fact that it might offend someone, we are holding people back from the knowledge they could gain from the work of literature itself. We attempt to placate everyone in today's society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct. If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained. Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not - and very well might never truly be - politically correct. People take umbrage to certain words, and consequently, some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves. After this is done, what have we really accomplished? Have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history? That is debatable, but by the same token, in school, we must learn about the Holocaust despite the fact that it upsets many people. We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again. So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but affected the entire world, should we not learn about our own faults in history? The times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now. Has it really helped us? No, for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was, they will not understand it. Napoleon once said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten? If everything that offends people is censored or taken away, we will have nothing left. For if one person is allowed to say what is and isn't acceptable, then others will partake in this as well. It would become a new fad, and people would find a problem with just about anything. So, essentially, by censoring works in libraries, we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be. We are forcing them to be ignorant of society's problems. In the end, we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it? I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource that should preserve the unvarnished truth of history for the betterment of future generations.
1685	4662	2	3	When people think of a library, they envision a quiet place to study and read. Teachers utilize the libraries for many different purposes. One thing they use it for is to access movies on various topics. These movies can provide visual and engaging learning experiences. Another use is to obtain books on certain people or events, which can offer in - depth knowledge. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to keep up with the world outside of school. So, what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed? I'll tell you what it is. Kids watch movies in class all the time. Some movies are not appropriate at certain times, but some are very insightful and helpful. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and deems that it is too inappropriate for children in, say, elementary school, it should be banned from that school's library. However, for high schoolers, chances are they have heard or seen worse. So, with that in mind, movies should stay in the libraries of high schools, but not all should stay in the elementary schools. Books are another excellent resource if used correctly. They help kids in history learn about old war heroes and past events. Some books, though, should be kept behind the counter and only used for specific classes. For instance, books that detail specifics about drugs should be taken off the shelves, put behind the counter, and if someone really needs a book about them, like for medicine purposes to become a doctor, then all they have to do is ask. Magazines are useful for a couple of different nice things. One use is for projects. If you have to do a project over something like food and can't use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures. Another common use is just for entertainment. Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of its cover or if a book is too hard to read, you could pick up a magazine. So, in reality, some things should be kept, and others taken away. People spend a significant amount of time in the library for many different reasons, and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and learning, and that won't change either. So, I guess I'm half - and - half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials. We need to make careful decisions based on the age and needs of the users to ensure a beneficial library environment.
1686	4663	2	3	I think that if a book can be properly published with all the necessary approvals and meets the industry standards, then it should definitely be able to be in a library. When a book is published, it clearly means it's open to the public, so I truly don't see any valid reason why it can't be placed in the libraries. If a book has to be removed from a library, one has to wonder why they even bothered to buy it in the first place. I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library. If someone doesn't like it, then they simply don't have to get it. I believe that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own establishment, but why would they waste the money in buying the book if they might just remove it later? The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books. Everyone has different views also. If anyone could remove books from libraries, then there wouldn't be any books left in the library. A book is a book. Not a criminal, so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published, then it can be put in libraries. There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because it's been published, so it's already open to the public. In conclusion, libraries should respect the publication status of books and let the public decide which ones to read.
1687	4664	2	3	I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time, but do you see them trying to get rid of whatever it is that made them feel like that? I have been offended by cartoons before, but you don't see me crying about it. You just have to suck it up and go on with life. Cartman from the TV show @LOCATION1 is one of the most offensive characters on that show. He uses every offensive language known to mankind. He makes fun of all the races, and he says he hates everyone equally. But still, you can't stop it. That is like trying to get a dog to be a cat; it just won't happen. It is also like trying to get rid of racism completely. That is what I think about finding something offensive. In conclusion, being offended is a part of life, and we shouldn't try to remove things just because they might upset someone.
1688	4665	2	3	When you walk into your local library, there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc. You have different types and styles of books. There are fiction and non - fiction, comedy, horror, children's books, and many more. Also, what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that, and that is not a good influence. When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around, they could run into a certain book that's not meant for them, and they could end up becoming influenced. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a child's life because they could go out into reality and try to imitate a book they have read, and it could end up being the wrong decision. Inappropriate movies and magazines, such as pornographic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store. Items like these are meant for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do what's right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them. The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violence, sex, rap music, and drugs, and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative - minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it. I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it used to be. And if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change. Even though I'm still young, I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear. And if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place. In conclusion, removing inappropriate materials from public and home spaces can help guide the younger generation towards a more positive path.
1689	4666	2	3	Censorship in libraries can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you don't want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored, then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine, to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Let's say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first book's material is very well - written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well - written but @MONTH1 not all be there; the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally, I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happened. Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would, but if you're writing about something that happened in your life that could have been offensive to others, they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life, then why show your children a book that isn't true? I'm not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on, you are looking into their perspective. Maybe their perspective of what happened is a lot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material, books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others. I have gone to libraries and found books that I was interested in, and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive, then sure, that should be censored. But if it is censored, it should only be for a certain age group. I have also gone and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it, they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the person's perspective. If they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it, then don't read it and find something that you wouldn't find offensive. Overall, the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad; to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it, I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that always likes a happy ending, then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non - fiction or fiction, then censorship is not for you. In conclusion, censorship should be carefully considered, taking into account the truthfulness of the content and the appropriate age groups.
1690	4667	2	3	My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain events that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear, such as younger children or people who don't agree with having to listen to things like bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these events. Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored. I recently saw photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding @LOCATION1. I find that these images @MONTH1 serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and see the newspaper, they can see horrifying images that some people @MONTH1 think they shouldn't be exposed to. Even as adults, people don't necessarily agree with it. Adults @MONTH1 see what's in the news and @MONTH1 find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing. But as far as the protection and limited exposure their children @MONTH1 have, it @MONTH1 not be such a good thing for their kids to be seeing. I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school. I casually switched the radio from AM to FM as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top - one - hundred song as I had expected. I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 to a talk - radio show host. The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the woman's comments. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk - radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands, but we can't kill him. The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me. The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country and were cursing at her. News like the death of @LOCATION1 isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well. Another instance when I was exposed to some information that @MONTH1 not have been well - accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of @CAPS1 belief. The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the @CAPS1 faith were born in @LOCATION3 and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in @LOCATION2. Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities and homeless people in @LOCATION2, there were people shouting at the protesters to leave and to go back to where they came from. When people hear things about this in the news, it can be very offensive because although it @MONTH1 be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to affect someone. It can easily affect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these people's opinions and @MONTH1 take that very offensively because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong. I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @MONTH1 not want to hear about it and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they @MONTH1 not be comfortable with. In conclusion, proper censorship of media can help protect people from inappropriate and offensive content.
1691	4668	2	3	If offensive materials like books, music, movies, and magazines are present, they should be taken off the shelves because little kids won't understand the context. These materials should not be there in the first place since almost everybody visits libraries. If I found them offensive, the library would probably get shut down, or whoever put them there would be fired. Kids should not see or know about these offensive items at all. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines are not meant to be found in libraries that kids frequent.   I think most people would be angry at the schools or libraries for having such materials. Most parents would talk to the people responsible. If this happened to me and my kid came home with an offensive magazine or anything similar, I would ask them where they got it and then go to talk to the people in charge. Most of the people who find these offensive things would be mad at the kids, but it's not the kids' problem that someone put such items there.  The first thing to do is to have an age restriction, say @NUM1 or older, on the books, movies, magazines, and music if they are in the libraries. They should not be in areas where kids go to read books. They should be placed where people who are @NUM1 or older can access them, but I still think they shouldn't be there. If offensive materials are in libraries, people should take the matter to court. In conclusion, keeping offensive materials away from public spaces, especially those frequented by kids, is crucial to avoid any negative impacts and potential conflicts.
1692	4669	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I firmly believe so. The reason is that there can be numerous books, movies, or magazines in places like libraries or stores that contain offensive content, such as violence or other inappropriate things. A great deal of such content can influence readers if they read an offensive book or if a kid watches a movie with violence.  One reason I think books should be removed from the shelves when found offensive is that what if a reader comes across a word in a book that offends them? Or what if they read a book that discusses bad things? Maybe a kid could read a book and learn bad behavior. Many issues can occur while reading a book. Moreover, many people take it very offensively if a book talks about their religion, race, or anything related to their personal life. That's why I think books should be removed from the shelf to prevent people from getting offended.  Another reason is that if a kid or someone underage rents a movie or their parents rent it, the kid might want to watch it without knowing what the movie is about. The kid could see something inappropriate or a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don't really notice what their kids are watching. So, it's important for them to be more vigilant and watch out for their kids. In movies, anyone can see a lot of bad things that can affect or offend anyone. Therefore, I think certain movies that can harm or offend certain families or parents, especially their kids, should not be on the shelves.  Magazines can also be offensive to many people. Whenever you go to a store, you always see magazines on the shelves or elsewhere. They might be talking about singers, people divorcing, violence around the world, arrests, or they could even have bad images that anyone can see. This is particularly bad if a little kid picks up a magazine with something inappropriate inside. That's why there shouldn't be magazines with bad content in public. Adults should also be careful not to buy certain types of magazines as they never know what their children might see.  In conclusion, there are many reasons why I think people should remove certain books, movies, magazines, or anything with offensive content. All around the world, you can see things that can offend you or others just by seeing something in a movie, listening to a song, or reading a book. It's not a good idea to have such offensive materials in places like libraries, stores, or anywhere else. People should ask themselves if they would be offended before reading a book or watching a movie, and then decide whether these materials should be removed from the shelves.
1693	4670	2	3	Yes, I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed. They should be placed in a different location so that children cannot access them in the area. This is because certain materials in these objects can lead to bad behavior in children.  To keep these objects away from children, set them in areas that children can't reach. For example, place them on high shelves, in closets, or even in the attic. For better safekeeping, put the objects that you think can give children bad ideas in a personal safe where no one can easily get things out.  It is important for some items to be accessed only by older people. For instance, books can have pictures that show children things that are not appropriate for their current age. Music can talk about things that the artist has done, and this might make a child want to do the same because they think it's cool since the artist does it. Magazines often show articles about rappers, actors, and other famous people doing something wrong, setting a bad example for children. These materials should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look. This is because the materials can sometimes harm the child or even put the child in the hospital.  From personal experience, I once touched or took some material that I shouldn't have, and the outcome was not good. From that experience, I've learned not to touch items that I know I shouldn't mess with.  In conclusion, it is crucial to keep certain items away from children. The outcome of children accessing these items may not be what you expect, and serious consequences might arise from the objects, which could later affect the same child. So, make sure the items are safely out of children's reach.
1694	4671	2	3	I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive, but not all. One such category is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another category could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having such content in the library could spark conflicts within or outside of the library. Additionally, books that express violent or criminal acts could also be considered for removal, but they should only be restricted from a younger audience.  I believe that anything containing slander or judgment on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time passes, people are taking religion more seriously. At first glance, such material may not seem harmful, but your opinion may change when your customers return angry and frustrated about what they read or saw. To avoid conflicts with customers, it's better to keep this kind of material out of the library, unless you want to deal with constant complaints and arguments.  Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one of the world's most significant problems, affecting everyone regardless of who it's against. Imagine a book in your library that labels all black teens as a problem or says all Arabs are dangerous. It's clearly racist. Now, think about how your customers of those ethnicities would feel. It's not a pleasant scenario. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful statements off library shelves is a smart business decision and will keep all customers satisfied. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'  Lastly, I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids tend to follow what they hear or see. Since they are still in a stage where they often mimic others, they may copy the violent or criminal acts they see in books. Peer pressure also plays a role, which could lead more children to commit such acts. If this happens, many parents will be outraged and blame the libraries for making such material available to children. So, if such material is in your library, it's best to keep it away from minors.  In conclusion, removing offensive and inappropriate materials from libraries is essential to maintain a harmonious environment, respect people's beliefs and identities, and protect the well - being of younger patrons.
1695	4672	2	3	Many people I know would be extremely upset if there were no more books on the library shelves. I think there should be a variety of books, including some that might be considered offensive, because who wants to read a boring and unexciting book? The libraries should have labels on the books. So, when people go to check out the books, there would be a label indicating that this book may not be suitable for certain people and might contain bad language. This is just an example.  There should be adult and children sections in the library, and perhaps sections for every type of book, like murder and mystery. The same goes for movies, music, and magazines. I love browsing through the books in the library because you never know what to expect from a book.  In conclusion, having a diverse collection of materials in libraries, along with proper labeling and sectioning, allows people to make informed choices. This way, libraries can cater to different interests while also being mindful of the potential sensitivities of different audiences.
1696	4673	2	3	Do you think we should have censorship in our libraries? I firmly say no because if we had censorship, then there would be very few good books, engaging magazines, and thrilling movies available. In this world today, everyone gets offended by something. For example, in action, horror, and comedy films, there could be gory blood scenes, intense violence, and harsh cursing, which sometimes make a movie truly captivating. Even in some books, there is offensive language and graphic violence. Some content even seems provocative. For instance, in @ORGANIZATION1, the book repeatedly uses the n - word. Even some magazines like fashion, sports, and certain car magazines are seen as provocative. If I walked into my local library and saw all my favorite movies, books, and magazines not on the shelves, I would never go back again. I'm not trying to say put adult books in the elementary school library, but in the public library, it's okay to have such books. Could you imagine a library with censorship? It would be completely empty, and we'd lose the rich diversity of media that libraries are meant to offer.
1697	4674	2	3	Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are charming children's books filled with colorful illustrations and simple stories, while others are intended for a more mature reader, delving into complex themes and advanced language. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that might be inappropriate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy. What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be foul language, extremely graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well. Unfortunately, there are some books that might cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories. I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a children's section filled with toys and bright colors, a teen section with contemporary novels, and an adult section with in - depth non - fiction and complex fiction. This helps kids remain in an area appropriate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read. A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy, thus defeating the purpose of a library.
1698	4675	2	3	No, I do not figure that. I say that there is some material for adults, teens, and children. The children aren't going to want to read the adult books filled with complex themes and mature content, and the adults aren't going to want to read the children's books with simple stories and basic language. The teens aren't going to want to read the children's books, but they might want to read the adult books, and that's okay. They will be adults soon and might be interested in more grown - up topics. There is nothing wrong with that. If the parents do not want their teens or children reading that kind of material, then they should go with them to the library and make them get their approval before checking out the books, magazines, or whatever it is they want to read at the time. Movies are the same. There are different materials for each age group. Some age groups might be interested in other age groups' material, and that's okay. It doesn't mean it's wrong; it just means they are maturing more and are interested or curious. Let them explore. They will figure out for themselves if the material is right for them or not. By allowing this exploration, we help them develop their own judgment and critical thinking skills.
1699	4676	2	3	OFFENSIVE BOOKS!!! Did you ever think about why students read what they read now? They read books about sex, guns, and many more because they think it's exciting. Well, guess what, it's not! The authors who make these types of books want you to buy them because they want their money, but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things. I think that books like that should be removed because you don't want your child to grow up reading those type of books. Then, when they have kids, they wouldn't want the same for their children. Many parents don't care what their children read as long as they are reading, and that's fine with them. It's not fine; it's very wrong. I wouldn't expect a great writer to use bad language, and they think it's okay to do that! That's why kids act the way they do now, because of books, movies, etc. I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores where adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I don't think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they don't want to learn that stuff, but some of them do, and I don't think that's right at all. That's why kids should read a very good book and not judge a book by its cover. By providing good - quality, positive books, we can guide kids towards a better understanding of the world and proper behavior.
1700	4677	2	3	Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library. Parents have different views on books, music, etc. One parent might not have a problem with one book that has a few curse words in it, but another parent might think it is not something they want their children to pick up and read, then later on start using that kind of language. But if the libraries censor that book and it is taken out of the library, it would make a big impact on people. What if somebody really likes that book, but since someone complained about it, it is now not allowed in the library. The library would lose people because of books being censored. Everybody might not agree on different subjects and they would want a certain book, music, movie, or magazine censored. But if one person complained and the book is no longer there, does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on? A person who might not have children might say, 'One little joke can't hurt.' A joke not suitable for a child under @NUM1 to read, hear, or watch. But a parent might get upset that their child is hearing, reading, or even seeing these things and might ban it from the library. When a student might need to go to the library to look up a topic they must research for school and cannot find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has been removed from the library. The student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the Internet. What if their teacher/professor said that they needed more than one source and all their information can not just be off the computer; they need a book, magazine, or newspaper source also. But since that topic they are researching about has upset someone, they are not able to find the information they are looking for. Yes, there are some books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not for children under @NUM1 or even pre - teens to teens. That is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups. Still, how do these sections keep our children from reading something inappropriate? Parents should know when they come into a library they should look for signs on the walls. If a library does not have signs that tell them what kind of section they are coming into, all they have to do is grab a few books off the shelves and read the inside cover or outside to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of that section. It should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children's section has toys and puzzles in them and children - themed walls. Censorship would not only get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but it would also make our libraries empty. A lot of people have different points of view. His view might be different from her view, from teens to young adults, teachers to children, parents to non - parents. Everyone is different, and no one person can speak for the whole world. This is why censorship would not work in our libraries, as it would undermine the purpose of libraries as a place of diverse knowledge and free access.
1701	4678	2	3	A lot of people engage in huge debates over what they believe is appropriate for children and teens to read, watch, and listen to. In this topic, various opinions will be discussed along with logical explanations regarding what some people consider the proper things kids should be exposed to. First, kids should not be watching rated @CAPS1 movies or even @NUM1-rated content if it contains vulgar content, sexual content, violence, and so on. Even though some parents allow this, these movies and magazines can have a significant impact on the child and possibly influence how they act in their future. Secondly, children still have a good number of movies available for them to watch and learn from, which can benefit them in their education, career, and other aspects. Finally, teens and young adults exposed to this genre of movies, books, music, or any other media - based entertainment are more likely to make destructive decisions than a teenager who isn't. Although this is not always the case, it does increase the chances of wrong decisions and has an influence on younger minds. In conclusion, young adults, teens, and children should not be able to watch media that contains vulgar content, sexual content, violence, etc., without parent supervision and permission.
1702	4679	2	3	In libraries, there should be a control over what certain kinds of books, magazines, or movies children should be able to read. For instance, when it comes to movies, are we going to let a @NUM1 - year - old watch a rated @CAPS1 movie, much less let him/her watch a porn movie? No, that's just plain wrong. This also applies to magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket, and kids can easily pick them up and look at them. Books as well, kids have very imaginative minds. They may not have pictures in them, but still, kids know a little more than what we give them credit for. Me, I would know this because as a little kid, my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again. Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own, some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me as possible. To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did, local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got a children's section, a teen section, and an adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids' section. This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well. I know some people wouldn't agree with my ideas, but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas? Now, for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it. Our kids need to know our culture so that they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up. There's no way they're going to be able to keep other people's opinions from reaching the ears of the @CAPS3. If our children are to grow up maturely, they need to experience or at least know what bullying is. Maybe learn what an atheist is or find out on their own what a sexist is. Some of it is inappropriate, so I will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age, but you can't keep it out of their lives forever. That's why it's best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things.
1703	4680	2	3	Censorship in Libraries. Have you ever come across something in the library that makes you say, ' @CAPS1! That's inappropriate!'? If so, I am sure you're not alone. Just the other day, I was in the library. There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now available for rental. I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive. How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this? How does this affect the minds of our country's youth? My thought on this topic is clear, although I am sure I'd receive some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter. I do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere? You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be influenced by it. I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material. Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are @CAPS2. New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. Even the covers of some @CAPS2 should be removed for the good of the public. It's interesting how these things just slide by the library. I once saw a young boy renting a @CAPS4 that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover! No one stopped him. Books are the same way. Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library. No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves. So, when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries? It is hard to say, but I strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this. I hope you'll join me in this epic battle for censorship to keep our youth safe.
1704	4681	2	3	I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them should be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysteries, and action. There are a lot of good movies out there, but some of them, I can agree, are too offensive to others. I guarantee that movies with comedy in them will be criticized for what is being said. For example, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is very offensive to some people. The only reason a person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people who don't have a life. I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person who criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people who read the books that offend the person being offended. Books about war are too graphic for some people. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only recently started noticing the people who are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the @DATE1's, people didn't care about what was in a library. They just wanted something to read. I say leave the libraries alone!
1705	4682	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a significant issue in the world today. Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences. However, many do not. All authors have the right to say what they wish, but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them. If libraries accept offensive types of magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children. Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a separate section for adults. Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area, and customers should be warned in some way. Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong, a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials separate. Those who borrow anything at the library may have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge. By sticking to this method, offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them. Items containing vulgar language are unjust to most. There are still the majority, however, who take the opportunity to view these materials. Everyone does have the right to do what they wish, but from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity as well as respect. No matter our color, size, looks, or personalities, we are all created equally as our constitution says. Therefore, we should only view what would be considered just to all. After all, everyone wishes to be treated kindly, right? So, implementing proper censorship in libraries is essential to ensure a healthy and respectful reading environment for all.
1706	4683	2	3	Public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people. I feel very strongly about my statement, because everyone in this world is different. Many people have different interests, religions, and customs. For instance, some may be interested in historical books, while others prefer science - fiction. If we took out certain books, and music from the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library. But if we had different sections of books, music, etc., people would be able to find what they want/need more easily, and no one would have to worry about getting offended. It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended. In a public library, the goal is to serve the diverse needs of the community, and keeping a wide - range of content is essential for that.
1707	4684	2	3	People in this common era have different approaches to the idea of libraries. Some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free. They see it as a haven where they can explore different ideas and cultures through various books and resources. Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very inappropriate. These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument. People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book. There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing. Some books, although good, can be inappropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills. Parents think the library is encouraging the check - out of inappropriate books, but this isn't all that true. It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you. They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to. It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background. I think that these so - called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries. There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive; so why take them down? I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections. This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much inappropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end. People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy. Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so. Why complain? Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it. Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child.
1708	4685	2	3	Most modern day books, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warnings in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' stickers on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive than books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. For example, they might use archaic slurs that were common in that era. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each category is in today's society. Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for its content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read. Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'legally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has existed for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay. And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teens, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The government has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'. So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't necessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artists like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for an adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place. By respecting the ratings and the educational value of these works, we can maintain a balanced and inclusive cultural environment.
1709	4686	2	3	What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, pictures, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so careful with computers, and what their children have access to. Every situation has its pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analyze the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult books. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at what they want on the computer. I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books, etc. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine that the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as opposed to borrowing it for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore? Another issue is banned books. @CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. @CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgotten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people think should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it? Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completely, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monitoring their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer. I think that there can be some censorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet educational place to learn. By finding a middle - ground between protecting children and preserving the cultural value of various materials, we can ensure the library remains a valuable resource for all.
1710	4687	2	3	Have you ever read something that you have found offensive, upsetting, or has made you mad? Do you think that there are certain books that shouldn't be allowed in a library because of its content? A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines these days contain things that are hurtful to society or portray bad images of certain social groups. In @DATE1's society there are many different groups of people and a lot of them have their own opinions on how they view different things. To me, when I think about a library, I think about how all different ages of people go to them, how there are many different groups of people there, and about the types of books that are in there. Taking this all into consideration, I believe that everything should be allowed in public libraries but I do think that there should be separate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be only for adults. I think this because if you take away all the things that are 'bad' or 'offensive' to you, you could be displeasing those who find these things interesting or enjoy reading them. In this case, people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting. By saying these things, separating the books into age groups is a good thing because then the younger children who are running around the library will not pick up something that they should not be looking at. I also believe that it would benefit them because then if someone comes into the library looking for a book but does not really know what to do and they go to where their age group would be; then they can see everything that is recommended for them. From my own experience, I know that I have read some books and looked at some magazines that I probably should not have looked at because I was too young. This does not mean that they need to take them off the shelves but maybe that they should be placed in an area where someone my age will not be able to find them. So the next time you go to the library and see something that is offensive to you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting. By creating a well - organized and age - appropriate library environment, we can accommodate the diverse interests of all patrons while protecting the younger ones.
1711	4688	2	3	Yes, there are a lot of books out there that contain graphic and sexual phrases, and there are a lot of concerned parents out there who are worried about what the libraries are possibly letting their kids read. One good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas of the libraries. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the kids will listen to those signs. We all know for a fact that pornography will stay away from libraries and remain where it is right now, so that's not an issue the parents should worry about. I think the libraries should be divided into sections. There's a kids' section, a teens' section, and an adults' section. But I don't think that the adults' section should be too far off from the teens' section because when we say adult books or magazines, everybody expects it to be one thing: porn. It should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it. There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to access them, you need to show the librarian some proof of age to be able to get into those sections, except the kids' section. The kids' section is a section that all kids can use because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids. I think that with that kind of security, it would allow parents to be able to be less stressed and worried about their child's safety and the insecurity of their mind. There are tons of other ideas to explore to be able to try and keep books with some kind of censorship, but most of them are off the wall and ridiculous. I think that music and movies shouldn't even be in libraries. Just leave those to other stores. It's better to let stores deal with that than libraries. The librarian probably doesn't even know half the CDs that probably get checked out anyway. So it's best if you don't have those in there at all. Give some thought to these ideas that I just sprang at you. I personally think that having doors blocking access to certain books would be a great plan to use because it would block access to these areas from certain kids. Some other parents or people might have ideas of their own, and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bulletin about them around the city or town. By considering these practical solutions and gathering more input, we can work towards creating a library environment that is both safe and beneficial for all.
1712	4689	2	3	Look it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a...harmful word. There have been many times when I have read a passage, whether it be a magazine article, a book, or a newspaper, and I have come across harmful words. They may not all mean harm towards me, but towards other readers, they could. People have their own opinions on different views, so a word or passage could affect me differently than, say, someone else. I don't think it's the materials; I think it's the readers' maturity level that makes a difference. That is how harmful words get changed into names, and then the next thing, peers are calling other peers that word. For instance, the word 'wetback' in a biography book about the @CAPS1 is okay to be there. It is when the reader interprets it the wrong way, and they think it is funny and cool to go around and call someone that word, especially a person of that race. That is when I don't think materials like this should be on shelves, but then again, it goes back to the maturity level. These words or passages can become harmful to someone that hasn't even read it, but because someone that has taken the initiative to start calling someone that word, or relating that passage to them. Books can, and are, a great reliable source for schoolers that are researching for class projects. I think it's the certain topics of books that get these words turned into harm. Books about certain races can cause name - calling among a school just because they read it in a book and think it is okay. Just because the book described a person that way doesn't mean it's okay for the reader to start calling people by that word. Other topics like'sex' in a book can be interpreted in the wrong way as well. Some teens think it's okay just because the characters in the book are doing it, then it's okay for them and their significant other to try it. Either way, with the book left on the shelf or taken off, it is still going to be a problem with name - calling. So it's going to take something else than a material being removed from a shelf to find a solution to this problem. We need to focus on educating readers about proper interpretation and respect, rather than simply removing potentially problematic materials.
1713	4690	2	3	Censorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is suitable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decisions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see. Firstly, people think that other people are incapable of deciding for themselves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were blocked because they had witchcraft, and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banned because there was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing, they still did not want any of the younger people to have it. Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express themselves. Lately, they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message, then I don't know what is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their heads. @PERSON1 was a movie that, off the top of my head, was showing a minor that had gone completely blood - thirsty and was killing anyone that went in his cave, just because he could. Although, sometimes we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more careful when I am out. In conclusion, there is no real yes or no answer. There are always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read. By taking personal responsibility for our media consumption, we can better navigate the complex world of censorship.
1714	4691	2	3	What race are you? What religion are you? What have you been taught? Almost anything like these could be considered offensive. So should these types of things be taken out of libraries? No, these types of things are everywhere. You just can't get away from them. Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials. For example, the commercials for @CAPS1 gum with that @CAPS2 woman, some people might consider that offensive. You might ask, '@CAPS3', well, there might be a person who has a disease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath. That person might take offense to these commercials. Another example might be television shows, like @ORGANIZATION1. Some @CAPS4 and just other races get offended by these types of things. Does that really mean we should get rid of them though? People everywhere are somehow offended by something; the world isn't perfect. Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen. So what's the point? If you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world, everything would be crazy. There is no such thing as a perfect world. I believe if there was, people would go crazy. For example, in the movie '@CAPS5 @CAPS6,' the main character finds a town that is supposed to resemble 'The @CAPS7 @CAPS8' or a perfect society. In the town at first, everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves. The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else. Also, they help kids learn. If you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life? So should these things go away or not? What do you think? By exposing ourselves and our children to a diverse range of ideas, even those that may be offensive, we can foster understanding and growth.
1715	4692	2	3	Is there a song that your parents wouldn't let you listen to when you were a child? When you sang this song, did they yell at you and ground you because they had told you many times before that you weren't allowed to listen to it? How about a movie that you wanted to go watch because it was what everyone was talking about, but it was rated @CAPS1, so you weren't allowed to watch it? That book on that shelf that you accidentally ran into while doing a research project, containing inappropriate language and terms. There is much media and books that are out there that parents wouldn't want their children to read. But overall, there is the government who censors things going on around the world. Censorship can have good and bad qualities. In my experience, I've noticed that people that know less tend to be more happy than people who know more. But if you are able to read and or watch these censored materials, you would see the idea from a certain point of view and maybe agree with the person. Most news is about things that are bad; rarely any good news comes around. For example, if something were to happen in @LOCATION1, where thousands of people were being used to test if lions liked to eat humans, the government would censor the news to the people in their country due to any reason. If there was a movie that was made that was racist against @CAPS2 people, the government would probably censor it. Things that look bad tend to be censored. I've noticed that people who read censored material feel special because they read or saw something that wasn't supposed to be known by the rest of the population. A lot more freedom of speech would occur if censored material wasn't censored. People also tend to become mad when they find out that material is being censored because they feel like something is being hidden from them, which could be valuable information. In reading, I have noticed that societies that practice censorship tend to have angry citizens. But on the other hand, if they believe that it's for the good of the society, then they accept the fact that it's not good for them. People also want to be given the right to make their own decisions. In a censored civilization, they have no idea what is going on outside their borders and are usually clueless or being lied to by their government. Censorship can have good and bad qualities. People tend to be offended when material is censored, but it's probably for the best for them. Hidden information could be good and bad, but mostly bad. Most people want to know the truth rather than a lie. Censorship is just bad in general. People should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch. By balancing the need for protection with individual freedoms, we can strive for a more informed and just society.
1716	4693	2	3	I somewhat agree with taking out books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material that could be offensive to someone, because it could contain racial slurs or it could be about something that isn't appropriate for children to read, such as explicit violence or sexual content. I think it just depends on the topic, maybe one thing could be offensive to one person and not the other, so people should choose wisely what they read. It wouldn't be fair to take certain books from the shelves of libraries because people take different interests in different topics. So, say one book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriate, like a controversial political view, but another person thinks that book is fine, it wouldn't be fair to the other person to take that book from the shelves. But something that I do disagree with in books or magazines that is inappropriate is pictures and comics with explicit imagery, because children shouldn't be allowed to have access to a book, movie, or a magazine that has that type of content in it. But also I think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it. So it depends on what type of things are in the book, movie, or magazine. Basically it's up to the person, if they don't like the criteria in any of those things then they shouldn't look into it.
1717	4694	2	3	Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookshelves if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers? I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the author, Katherine Paterson. From my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the shelf, there would not be a variety of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten curious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book. I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelves just based on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety of books to choose from, as this enriches the reading experience and allows for diverse viewpoints.
1718	4695	2	3	Have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content? In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people. People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive. Although there are things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different than the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive. People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines. What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers. There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children. Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no - no's are what teaches them wrong. Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries. Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children. Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way. An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone. It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular. How does this pertain to offensive books? Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm. Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose. Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet. Protecting children from adult - content filled libraries should be the least of a parents' concerns. Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about. The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds. Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book. A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable. Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read. Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books are a must for them. Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and reading wouldn't be as popular as it has been. I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring. Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading. There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today. Even though they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book. Tom @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are famous for writing gory, violent, gruesome books that would be qualified as offensive to others. You have the choice not to read them or to read them. Books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the bookshelves because they are essential to everyday people and reading. They are required by some to enjoy a good book, and removing them would limit the cultural and intellectual resources available to the public.
1719	4696	2	3	Hi, my name is Mason and I'm writing about whether we should take books off the shelf and so on. People have different views on different things. Books give a different form of learning to different people. I personally don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or TV, but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Everyone likes to sit down and read a good book every once in a while, like a thrilling mystery or a heart - warming novel. Music doesn't really teach you anything in a traditional sense, it relaxes you in different ways. Some people might learn from listening to music, like learning about different cultures through world music, but I'm not one of those people. It influences you to get motivated. Say you're getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some energetic music can get you hyped up for that game. When I sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it because I have the patience to sit down and watch it, to learn from it. But that is just me; other people have different ways of learning. The best way for me is to watch movies. They get straight to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you already know. Magazines are helpful too. They have short articles that get straight to the point, too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out a lot, like science magazines that explain complex concepts simply. So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you a lot, but books, movies, and magazines do help you to a certain point. It is up to other people to decide whether music should be taken off the shelves, not just one person, because music might help other people in different ways, not just one way but many ways too, such as emotional expression and stress relief.
1720	4697	2	3	I am a student from @CAPS1. I wanted to let you know that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the school's library and the public library as well. The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books. Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading. I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do. I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn. To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me. One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like. I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only their choice and not everyone's. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library. If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school. Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family members had seen a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library. So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in. They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again. Also another reason is that if they were to be taken out, then another person might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there. That is why I think those types of books should be in a special room instead of them being taken out. Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important. That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book/ magazine then they should just request the book/ magazine that they want to read. By doing that then the books that aren't being used could actually be used by someone else that is interested in it. So if we keep all our books, then more students and people would go and read. In conclusion, people might say that taking out books is better than keeping them. Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better. It is better because someday those books can be useful no matter how old they are. If they were inappropriate books like mentioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place. If there aren't enough interesting ones then requesting one is another way to do it. That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do whatever in order to not let books go to waste, ensuring that the library remains a rich source of knowledge for all.
1721	4698	2	3	There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another. Censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate. One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' What one person deems inappropriate could be deemed viewable to another. This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know what is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries is not a good thing.   @PERSON3 and @CAPS2 walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that depicts a person standing over a two - hundred - pound, twenty - four - point, state record, whitetail deer with a gun in their hand. @PERSON3 is a firm believer in providing for his family and the rights given to an individual in the second amendment of the @LOCATION1 constitution. Even if that means killing an animal for its resources. For some, there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat. @PERSON3 will see the magazine as an opportunity. He might learn tips from the magazine, or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful.   @CAPS2 on the other hand is a conservative. She believes killing is wrong and inhumane. She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section. @CAPS2 prefers not to know where her meat came from. She will view this magazine as inappropriate. Again, censorship is relative to the person looking over the material. Does that mean that just because @CAPS2 thinks the magazine is inappropriate, it should be taken off of the shelf so that someone like @PERSON3 cannot read it, appreciate it, and gain knowledge from it? That choice is up to @CAPS2 not to read the magazine, not to the librarian. @CAPS2 is responsible for her own views and choices. She is entitled to them. @PERSON3 is entitled as well. Leave the choice to the reader.   Over in the book section there are @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @PERSON1 is a fanatic for science and history. @PERSON2 has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion. At the end of the row, on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution. @PERSON1 believes this theory and sees the book as interesting. @PERSON2 looks at the book and thinks to himself, 'That stuff is not true. Why would anyone waste their time reading it.' Does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because @PERSON2 will not read it? @PERSON2 should just walk away from it. If he chooses not to, that is up to @PERSON2. Leave that choice to @PERSON2.   Up at the desk there are the librarians. They have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well. But the books, music, movies, and magazines that are displayed for checking out should not be chosen because he or she likes them or opposes them, but because someone might be looking for the information in that material. If the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it.   Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries. It takes material away from people that can be useful. Censorship, along with many other things, is relative. What one person deems inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person. Based on moral values, character, and opinions developed with the progression of life, people have made judgements on what is appropriate or unacceptable. That choice to look at that magazine, read that book, or listen to that song should be left up to them, not made for them. In a free - thinking society, the power of choice in accessing information should remain with the individual.
1722	4699	2	3	Have you ever thought that some of the things we read about and take home from libraries are not suitable for young children? Certain materials found in libraries are sometimes not age - appropriate or even offensive to other people. Not all books, music, movies, and magazines offend people or contain inappropriate content, but they may expose children to things that are rated and should not be learned at a library.   Most music in today's society is not appropriate because of the content such as sex, drugs, and violence. Last fall when I visited my school's library, I came across a movie that I thought was not school - appropriate and should not be watched without a parent's verification. When young teens and children see, hear, or read about sex and drugs, it may give them the wrong impression and encourage them to engage in such activities. When I see teens doing things that they shouldn't in public, the first thing they often say is 'I heard it on a movie'.   Most public libraries have movies, books, music, and other materials on shelves that are not appropriate for young children. Most librarians are busy and cannot watch the entire library, but they can ensure that inappropriate materials are secured and put away from juveniles.   Most of the time, a child will read what looks interesting and fun. Today's books that contain violence, guns, drugs, and sexual content on the front cover make it hard for a child not to be attracted to them. In a school library, @PERCENT1 of the time all books are age - appropriate, but in a public library, it's different because the public library serves both children and adults. Some books should not be on the open shelves, but the rated materials should be properly managed.   In conclusion, libraries need to be more vigilant about what's being checked out, regardless of who it's from. Librarians should ask for IDs to ensure that inappropriate materials are not accessed by young children. By doing so, we can better protect the young from unsuitable content while still providing a wide range of resources for all.
1723	4700	2	3	All things in the world are not strictly black and white. Every person is different, with varying ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of speech and the press.   Magazines, music, books, and movies are mainly for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. Let's say there is a @NUM1 - year - old girl who just had her first day of high school. While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. Some parents may deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation.   It's human to make mistakes and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's natural to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. To censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens. Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together.   The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment.   Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace'sex' or it could be something like extreme propaganda. There's a reason that our constitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how appalling someone may find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten published.   Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity to look elsewhere. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the freedom of access to information while also being responsible in our choices.
1724	4701	2	3	There are many perspectives on censorship in our country. That's just how our country is; we have different opinions on everything we do. But we have to live with it. These many different perspectives come from the old, the young, parents, and children. In libraries, there are some books, music, etc. that may be offensive to people.   But we all have different opinions, so we can never listen to just one person. Otherwise, it would start a fight between people who disagree with him/her. I think people who go into the library should be mature about what goes on there. Otherwise, they shouldn't be in the library looking at whatever they are wanting to read about.   The library is open to the public and has a lot of knowledge to share with us. But if we get rid of all the censorship, it will deny people knowledge. The books that might be removed would be mainly because of the children. Parents don't want their children to access material that is not appropriate for them, so they try to keep it hidden.   I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not. And we should remind parents that some things in the library are not suitable for children's eyes and let them be responsible for what their children look at. By maintaining a balanced approach to censorship and parental responsibility, we can ensure that the library remains a place of learning for all ages.
1725	4702	2	3	I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certain books, they should bring it to the attention of the library. The author who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody does not want their children looking at a book or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundaries that the parents have set.   However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with inappropriate magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults' job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.   Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult who gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you. In a public library, we should respect the rights of the library owner and the freedom of access to information while also being responsible for protecting the well - being of children.
1726	4703	2	3	When picking a book, music, movie, or magazines from the library, it's always a tough decision. You might be like me and want to read more than one book at a time. Books that are considered offensive often turn out to be more interesting than plain, boring ones. So, why would anyone take books off the shelf just because they're offensive?   When children pick books from the library, you want to ensure they're kid-friendly books. You also want to check if they're educational. You definitely wouldn't want a little kid to get hold of an adult book or a book that's offensive in some way. That's why having an adult section and a kids section in the library makes sense.  When we walk into a library filled with books, there's a huge variety of every kind of book. If books were taken off the shelves, we'd reduce the incentive to go to the library. After all, if you're not going to find a book there, why bother going?   The last reason not to take books off the shelves is that people who can't afford to buy books obviously come to the library to borrow them. Taking books away would just limit their learning and wouldn't be beneficial to them.  The only reason I'd find it okay to take offensive books and other materials off the shelves is for the sake of children's safety. If the libraries are thinking about removing offensive books, they should hold a public vote to see what everyone else thinks. If they decide to take books off the shelves, why not just have an adult section in the library? Anybody who is @NUM1 years of age or older could access it. So, make finding a book easier and don't take our offensive books completely away from us.
1727	4704	2	3	All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Katherine Paterson, an author, believes, as her quote suggests, that some books should never reach the hands of children. But does everyone share the same view? No. I'm one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find it offensive.  Imagine you're an old - fashioned woman who adheres to old - fashioned ideals, like no cursing or violence. You pick up a book, read the first page, see cursing, and decide to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library. Soon, the library becomes half - empty because of one woman and her beliefs. Beliefs are wonderful outside of reading and can shape who you want to be. In my opinion, books don't have beliefs. This is true for some books, but a book where someone runs from danger or flies into the sky, those are dreams, and no one can crush dreams, offensive or not.  I compare books to dreams because they are the dreams of the authors who wrote them and wanted to share those dreams with the world. Telling a person they can't publish their book just because another person finds it offensive is like telling the author that their dream is offensive. If you don't want your child to read this book of dreams, then don't let your child pick it up. As a parent, you can protect your child from the offensive content in the book, just as you protect them from the dangers of strangers in the real world.  Authors don't always write for everyone. They don't write for one woman, one man, or one child. Authors write for those who share a similar dream. If you don't share the same dream as the author, that's fine. No one is forcing you to share in their sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams. Authors write because they want to express themselves in ways only words and stories can. Don't shun a book because one thing in it offends you. Remember, a book is someone's dream.  In short, you'd never crush your child's dreams. If your child wants to grow up and be a fireman, you don't tell them it's offensive to people and they can't. Why would you do something to someone else's dream when you've never even met them? Be a bigger person and allow that person to live their dream through a story. No matter the level of offense, you don't have to pick up the book and read it. The number one way to not be offended by a book that might offend you is to never read the book in the first place.
1728	4705	2	3	Certain materials that are created to offend people should be removed from shelves everywhere. I am firmly against any material that is offensive to someone or something else. The three main reasons I oppose offensive materials are that it's wrong to offend others, offending others can lead to personal issues, and the act of offending others will eventually lose its appeal.  To simply write a book, a magazine, or make a movie just to offend someone or something is morally wrong. People should always treat others the way they would like to be treated. When someone creates negative lyrics about a person or something, it might indicate that they have personal issues. In an attempt to ignore their own problems, they resort to making fun of someone else.  Offending other people can lead to serious personal problems. How? If someone constantly talks about you or offends you on a daily basis, it can cause people to become depressed. They may start to believe that they are worthless. I recall in the eighth grade, a girl told everyone that I was a 'garden tool' and that I'd do anything for a piece of change. She even made a song taunting me about my appearance every day. She recorded it and distributed it at school. People heard it and, like followers, started taunting me too. I soon became deeply depressed. It got so bad that I was suicidal. I thought the world would be a better place without me. I had to see a therapist to overcome those thoughts. What other people do or say about you can have a severely negative effect on you.  Last but not least, people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone. The victim will get tired of being teased or talked about, and others will stop listening to that negative garbage. If people stop supporting that degrading material, then the author won't have anything to write about, and the singer won't have anything to sing about. Their career will decline because there's no future in offending others.  There are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries, stores, and everywhere else. These negative comments won't get anyone anywhere in life. As I've explained, it's simply wrong to offend others, it can lead to personal issues, and it will eventually become tiresome. Nothing good comes from making people feel bad. So, once again, these negative materials should be abolished everywhere.
1729	4706	2	3	In my personal opinion, I think that those books that have content you don't want to read or that you find offensive should remain available. After all, it's not like the person who's offended by it has to read it.  Imagine you're in the library and you spot a book that you think is offensive. You might think to yourself that the book should be removed from the library. But you have to consider other people's perspectives. Just because you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will. That's why libraries have age - groups and grade - levels set up. This way, a kid who likes picture books won't end up with a book that has curse words or other adult - oriented content. The same concept applies to movies, magazines, music, and so on.  For example, I was walking through the library when I saw a book called @CAPS1 the @ORGANIZATION1. I thought to myself that it looked like a stupid book and that it should be thrown away. But let's think about it. Is that fair? Maybe that's some kid's favorite book, and when they come to the library the next day, it's gone.  What if you go to the library to look for your favorite book and find out that someone found it offensive or just didn't like it as much as you did, so they had it removed? That doesn't seem fair, does it?  In conclusion, this is what I think about removing books that are offensive or that some people just don't like. I believe they should stay on the shelves because we shouldn't remove them based on our personal opinions.
1730	4707	2	3	There are both bad and good books out there. Different people find different books offensive based on their own values. Some people like the books that others dislike. In a sense, books can be both bad and good. They're good because people can improve their reading skills after reading a lot, but they can be bad because many people dislike reading.  I think that when you enter a library, there should be a proper selection of books for different audiences. Children visit libraries, and what if they pick up a bad book and develop horrible habits? Children and adults have very different views on what to read. Kids usually want to read fairytale stories and such, while adults enjoy mystery stories about murder and other adult - themed content.  Yes, libraries allow people to check out any book they find interesting. But what if that book is inappropriate for their children to see lying around at home? It's simple. If you make sure you don't leave your books lying around, kids won't form bad habits or discover things they're not supposed to know. Kids are curious, and they'll try to read your books or look at something bad in a magazine.  In libraries, there are children's sections and adult sections, which helps to some extent. However, your child can still find a bad book at home. Parents can prevent this for the safety of their children's thoughts and to avoid the questions their children might have about a certain book. It's a good idea to put things away when you're done and keep all inappropriate books out of your child's reach.  Books can be both bad and good. You can find the information you need, or you might come across something you really don't want to read or see. Books contain things that we sometimes need to know and sometimes want to know more about. If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they haven't read it or looked at it, and then just hide it away from them. In the end, by taking these simple steps, the problem will be solved.
1731	4708	2	3	Censorship in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, what is offensive to some @MONTH1 not be to others. So, precisely how do we know when expressing ourselves in an artistic manner that we've crossed the line? We truly don't, and that's exactly why censorship is such a highly controversial topic.  In the music industry recently, there have been explicit messages in songs and music videos that aren't the most suitable for teenagers. Being a teenager is a period of constant upheaval in one's life. You are compelled to make decisions that will shape you as an individual. When songs out there are about drug use and other criminal activities, teens often view them as trendy and follow along because they perceive them as ordinary activities that can cause no harm. However, little do they know that they are ruining their lives by engaging in such behavior. So, I somewhat concur with censorship in that regard.  In literature and art, things adopt a more serious tone than in music and other media. With literature, it's about communicating one's thoughts and feelings regarding a story or other subject. In art, you express yourself visually on a canvas or abstractly through other materials and forms. In both cases, you convey your feelings and emotions. So, censoring these would, in turn, suppress one's voice and emotions. When you take away a person's voice and emotions, you are left with an empty shell of an individual who will never experience life to the fullest.  As time has passed, I have noticed that people have also changed. When @PERSON1 uses the '@CAPS3 - word' in some of his literary works, it didn't offend people at that time. But now, times have shifted. Now, it's not acceptable that @PERSON1 used this word. On the other hand, it's considered okay for rappers and others to say it frequently in their music. So, how do we determine what's offensive and what's not? Well, it all depends on the reader, listener, or viewer's perspective.  These days, parents attempt to shield their children from the outside world and make it seem like it's all rosy by censoring things the children might encounter in their daily lives. This doesn't solve the problems in the world. There will always be war, crime, and death, no matter how hard we try to prevent it. As long as there's 'good', there will always be 'bad'.  All loyalties aside, in my honest opinion, I firmly believe that censorship in the @CAPS1 is a bad idea and will never work to solve the actual problems in the world. It will merely cover them up, just like the dialogue or image they so desperately want to eliminate. In conclusion, we should strive to find a balance that respects different viewpoints and allows for the free expression of ideas while also being mindful of the potential impact on vulnerable groups.
1732	4709	2	3	Although it is a new day and age where the demand is high for electronic books, hard - back and paper - back books are not obsolete quite yet. Many people still cherish the old tradition of traveling to libraries and embarking on the quest for the perfect book.  Also, with the economy in a downturn, it is the more cost - effective option. But the big question is, can people find everything they desire at their local library? For some people, that may not be the case because of library censoring.  Yes, it is true that many libraries now censor many things that they consider inappropriate for children's eyes. I agree that some materials should not be displayed on library shelves. Although some adults or teens desire more mature articles, these things should not be accessible for children to view. One of the most loyal customer groups at the library is children and their parents. Parents do not want their children to be exposed to explicit materials at such a young age. Also, if libraries lose young families as customers, that would mean almost half of their clientele would be lost.  So, next time when you want to buy something that might be too mature for children, you might want to think twice before going to the library. Instead, go to a book store and purchase whatever you need there. By doing so, we can keep children in a safe, innocent environment. In conclusion, while libraries play an important role in providing access to knowledge, it's crucial to maintain a balance between offering a wide range of materials and protecting the well - being of young patrons.
1733	4710	2	3	In my opinion, everyone should have an absolute right to go to the library and obtain whatever book, magazine, movie, and music they want. People visit the library for numerous reasons, such as using computers, borrowing books, etc. Also, having a public library is extremely useful for people who don't have a computer at home. It's a public library, and you should be able to go there and find almost anything you need, whether it's a book or a movie.  Everyone has different likes and interests regarding their books or movies, and I'm certain that people go to the library expecting it to have what they are looking for. Some people do go to the library and don't find what they're searching for. Then, people get angry and upset because they assumed the library would have it, but it doesn't. But yes, I firmly think that there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book at the library that you need. I mean, it's a library; they should have a comprehensive collection.  Also, people have the right to go and get whatever book or movie they want. It's called freedom. Everyone is unique, and everyone likes different things. There have been a few instances when I went to our library to find books or movies, and they didn't have them. You would expect that a library would have a book or movie about trying to potty - train a toddler, but they didn't.  I think that they should have any and every kind of book, magazine, and movie you want at the library. Yeah, some people @MONTH1 might take offense to it, but who cares? Obviously, they don't want it, so they can just leave it and go get what they want. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean other people don't. So, no, I don't think that just because some people don't like them, they should be removed from the shelves.  So, no, I absolutely do not think that any books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves. You are who you are, and you like what you like. It shouldn't matter what other people think about it as long as it's what you like. So, in my opinion, the library should be a valuable resource for everyone, and the books, magazines, etc., should remain on the shelves for the people who do like to read or watch them. In conclusion, libraries should uphold the principle of providing diverse materials to meet the varied needs and interests of the public.
1734	4711	2	3	I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People enjoy books with offensive language or content because they love to feel the energy or tone of the writer. I personally love offensive language. If everything was censored, it would feel like everything is dull and fake.  For example, when you hear the line 'Your @CAPS1****** cheating on me @CAPS2****', you can really feel the intensity in your body. Now, if we censor it to 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1', it just feels dull. And if you've ever been cheated on, you probably can think of ten different things you would have said differently and uncensored. If you're a parent who doesn't want their child reading or seeing this, you should try to teach them or keep them away from such content.  Instead of removing these materials, why not just move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library? The @NUM1+ section will serve as a warning to kids and parents about what they're getting into. If parents don't want their children to be exposed to the realities presented in these materials, then they should avoid that area.  Libraries are usually divided into sections. But if not, if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children's books into sections of the libraries, then they should be able to provide you with that information. In conclusion, a well - structured library with appropriate sections can ensure that different types of materials are accessible while also protecting the sensibilities of different age groups.
1735	4712	2	3	Censorship @CAPS1, when you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magazine, you @MONTH1 come across some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because of some content on one page? The person has the ability to decide whether to read that book or not.  Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be mature enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about whether the library has the book they want. They should not have such concerns when going to a library. When you think of some of the so - called 'worst' books out there, who would want to read those anyway? Many books that people think are bad just have a single inappropriate word on one page. They don't realize that they are banning a perfectly good book for others.  @PERSON2's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' caused a big uproar regarding whether or not to put the book on the shelves. The book contained the @CAPS4 word, and some people were not happy about it. However, the book was very well - written and just had a few bad words. Should a few bad words prevent a book from being a prize - winner? The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be left gathering dust in a storage room in boxes.  There are many ways to keep a certain age group from getting a certain book. The library could set aside those certain books in @CAPS5 own part of the library. Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a more suitable way instead of banning the books altogether. The books still will be subject to censorship to determine if they belong in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task, and no one knew how to do it? That book contained bad language. Should the health and knowledge of the world decline because of some bad material in a book that could help us in the near future?  Authors have just the same rights as we do. They should have a say in whether @CAPS5 own book is suitable to be on the shelves. The government should not have all the say in this important matter. The community and the author who writes it should have more of a voice than anyone else. When an author writes a novel, they focus on the great content they are putting into this wonderful piece of art, not thinking about whether it is suitable for children to read. The author just loves to write and should not have to worry about all these concerns.  There is this book we read this year called '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 Are @CAPS7 @CAPS8'. This book had language that I don't think would be suitable for everyone in some parts of the novel. Now, do I think the novel should be banned from a library? No, because it used the words in a very non - violent way. When reading it, I felt that I was not harmed by the content, and neither were any of my fellow classmates. @PERSON1 was the author of this book, and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. So, the next time you think of banning a book, think of all the warm hearts you could be breaking. In conclusion, we should approach the issue of book censorship with an open mind and a focus on preserving the freedom of expression and access to diverse literary works.
1736	4713	2	3	Do I believe certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No, just because a book, a song, a magazine article, or a movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves. Sure, we have a right to remove that book, but there are a lot of things that are going to offend people. Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf. It's not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books. If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive, we would have a lot of empty bookstores. Because, face it, people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion, is being made fun of in a book that they had read. We all get offended, but just move on from it and find something different. We are not forced to read that book, listen to that song, or look at the magazine. We have a choice, and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf. You never know, someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was beneficial or relating. So, it should not be up to one person, but if a whole community has a problem with a book, then I can see removing it can be an option. In the end, we should balance individual sensitivities with the greater good of maintaining a diverse range of materials for all to access.
1737	4714	2	3	I think that some books in the library some people might find offensive. But some of those books have a deeper meaning behind them. I think there's one book out there that a lot of people love to read, and that is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The book uses the '@CAPS3' word quite a lot, and many people take that as offensive, but why? There was a big argument about a lot of book companies changing the word in the book to @CAPS4 @CAPS5. From my perspective, I think it should stay the same. Why change it now? Many English teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named @CAPS6 saving @PERSON1. It's not being used in a bad way at all; it's just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days. The book is powerful and shows readers a strong aspect of life. Yes, you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after it's been out for a long time to the public. The book would not convey the same meaning as it would if it is being changed. Altering the book would undermine its historical and cultural significance, so it's best to keep it as it is to preserve its original message.
1738	4715	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library. In the quote, she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left. The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question. There is a simple answer to this question. It should not be censored. Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on the type of person and their background. As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize. The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries. As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books. To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works. Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues. These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the children's section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately. The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with. This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored. The problem with what is 'explicit' is that there is no clear - cut line. Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages? In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got pregnant within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind. Proper instillation of morals and values on the home - front will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible. Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left. This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone. As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist. It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgment, the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad'. In conclusion, libraries should strive to provide a wide - ranging collection while relying on parental guidance and proper sectioning to manage access to different materials.
1739	4716	2	3	Do you agree with me that we should be allowed to read, listen to, or view what we want? I think it is unfair that the schools have the right to tell us what we can look at. The right is ours; this is America, and we have the right to do whatever we want within reason. I think we should have the choice to read a particular item, and if it is offensive, then don't read it. Because it might be offensive to you, but not everyone thinks it is vulgar, rude, or obscene. I am asking you, the paper, to stand up with me and fight the school and tell them what students should be allowed to read. It is not right to censor good material just because some person doesn't like it. That is all I am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship. By standing together, we can ensure that students' rights to access diverse information are protected.
1740	4717	2	3	I think that no books should be taken away. I think that if an adult or a child wants to look at something or read about something, they should have the right to. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they can't because the song has curse words in it, they should be allowed to. And if it bothers someone, the bothered person can leave. If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inappropriate, who cares? And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they can't because it's too violent, so the library doesn't have it. I think libraries should be able to have whatever inventory they want. And if it's too violent or if the music is too explicit, just don't let children get a hold of it. Libraries can implement age - appropriate restrictions to ensure that while all materials are available, they are accessed by the right audience. This way, we can maintain a balance between freedom of access and protecting the sensibilities of different patrons.
1741	4718	2	3	If I found a book that I thought was inappropriate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to carefully check into it to see what she thinks about the book. If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle regarding a book and didn't know whether she should remove it, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it really needed to be removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropriate for people to look at, and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive aspect would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism. If I found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults or some teenagers should watch. My opinion alone can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book, movie, or other items. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids may get a hold of these movies, watch them, and then go out into the real world and imitate the bad actions that were on the film. For example, if the movie or book was about drugs, then some kids might think it was alright for them to do because they saw it on TV. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kids watch these. I think if they would closely watch what their children do, then some of this might not happen. Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. A few years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes in the music. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content, or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism involved. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it's their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release them so everyone can listen to them. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time.
1742	4719	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have the ability to make their own judgment, children's parents have the right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone can learn from it. Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have well - developed morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocery store, they should know that no matter how tempting it may be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. It doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do. Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated 'R' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated 'R' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a guardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensely because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simply say, 'NO!' It's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determining whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provocative book. If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life might possibly become rather boring. Although some people might find books and songs to be offensive, others might benefit from these materials. A child might pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never have learned such things. Reading information like this creates a more advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opportunity to arise for their children to become smarter and wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from the chaos of everyday life for some children. They might use a book to get away from the struggles of daily life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to fewer books a child could have an opportunity to discover. I once read that even English classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The Catcher in the Rye. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life - changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so it shouldn't always matter if it's crude. A child or young adult might learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials. In conclusion, books, magazines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themselves. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgment of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, no matter how crude it may be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, it's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from it. Do you really want our society to prohibit intellectual thinking just because they think certain material might be offensive? Think about it.
1743	4720	2	3	I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side of profanity is that it gives books, music, and movies a certain flavor and texture. It shows how a person feels, most times it's a sign of anger. Profanity can also change a person's behavior, in terms of the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is both good and bad. I like it in music and movies, but I hate it when people use it to talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person's age. For example, books for ages three to thirteen should not contain profanity, but those for ages fourteen and up can. The reason why people should take profanity - laden materials off the shelves is that kids should have a healthy and profanity - free life. They should have a good start towards learning. Books and other entertainment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easily, and if they imitate the bad actions of others, they will likely become bad themselves. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is that if you don't like profanity, don't buy it. Also, keep it out of kids' reach. The main reason why people swear is because of movies and songs. It can change a person dramatically. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life negatively, such as not getting a good job, getting in jail, and raising up bad kids who learn from the parents' mistakes. In a sense, profanity is good for movies as it gives them action and drama. Profanity consists of words that are most times negative, expressing anger and rudeness. We have a society full of profanity, and it's like a widespread disease, passing on from people to kids and then to their kids. I have experienced this the hard way because I'm Chinese and I came to the United States back in 1990. I did not know any English. People would cuss at me all the time, and this could all be avoided if we didn't have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned a lot about people by the way they talk, which helps me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit its access to kids. Profanity is like ice cream; some people want it, and others don't. People can make their choice of putting themselves in a profanity - free life. They can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what I think is the right thing to do, but not for adults. Due to profanity, people tend to get themselves into trouble. For example, some people in the US get pulled over by an officer for a low - cost speeding ticket, but then they would swear at the officer, putting themselves in more trouble. This could all be avoided if they didn't say anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech. I know this because I'm on the school football team. Before every game, our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end, what I'm saying is that profanity should stay, but keep it out of reach of kids. For books, parents shouldn't buy them if they don't want their kids to see them. For movies, read the label on the back of the DVD and check the age limit and for profanity. Lock up the cable shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no access to them. If you don't want any part of profanity, you can make yourself stay away from it. We all know that there is nothing you can do about others using profanity, but just don't use it yourself and stay clean. Do what you think is right.

Children are most likely accompanied by an adult when they go to a library and are normally looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. If a customer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive, then it most likely was not an accident. Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few individuals find it offensive. Children are quite inquisitive in libraries because they are aware that adult material is also in the library. This is where an adult steps in and supervises the child. Some parents don't mind that children see these images or read inappropriate information, but on the other hand, some parents do. If someone comes across offensive information, they were most likely actively looking for it and are aware of its location. Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. There is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the library. It is the parent or guardian's decision to allow or not allow their child to visit the more inappropriate areas of the library. Everyone has different rules, and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the library's job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area. There is a place for everything in a library, and most of the locations are fairly obvious as to what kind of information is held there. For instance, more adult and inappropriate material is located in the back of the library. Adult matter is placed there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to provide a bit more privacy to people who are reading it. Children's books and movies are usually located in the front of the library so it catches their attention more. Children may never know what else is in the library if they don't go looking for it. Children should be accompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for inappropriate material. Other material that could be offensive could not only be to children; it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. Also, if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it. Everything is labeled in a library, and something doesn't just suddenly appear if you weren't looking for it. Overall, material in a library is public and for anyone who comes into the library. Children should be watched if they are likely to wander in the library. If someone does not want to find this information or thinks it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area where it is located.

1746	4723	2	3	When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world, I firmly believe that there are indeed cases where certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be on the shelves. Not only are there elements in these materials that children might not understand and misinterpret, but there are also things that adults of any age might find offensive. In my years of being in school, I have come across numerous books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I thought should never have ended up on the library shelves. For instance, one day, while searching through the library for a book to do my book report on, just from reading the back cover, I learned that the book involved drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things that I believed were unsuitable even for someone my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the book - purchasing process, I'm sure they rarely give a second thought to whether a book offered to young children and teenagers is inappropriate or offensive. However, in almost all cases, every single book has something that would prove them wrong. Also, I once encountered offensive content while reading a book that was touted as a great read even for those under the age of twelve. Based on my own experience of reading the book, I'd say those who recommended it are misguided and should re - evaluate the specific age group they're marketing it to. Not only have I found books in the library to be inappropriate and offensive, but also many magazines, movies, and music. Usually, there isn't a large amount of offensive music in libraries, but in some cases, it does exist. For example, I knew someone who was doing a report on pop culture. While researching and listening to the music provided by the library, they found it extremely offensive and inappropriate for themselves to hear. Other than that, I've found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive. I myself think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 should understand the meaning of being mature. I've observed that most teenagers and even children who read offensive books often develop behaviors that most parents and teachers don't approve of. When my children reach this age, I hope they'll never act like some of the kids I've seen or talked to. After realizing how much inappropriate/offensive content there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books and other resources offered in libraries, but I also sincerely hope they address this issue right away. I'm certain that parents around the world would share my view, and I know for a fact that I'd never want my children to read the books I've read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should recognize when recommending books to children and teenagers. The world is becoming more and more violent every day, and it's up to the future generation of children to solve this problem. In such a situation, we don't want the minds of the youth to be filled with offensive and inappropriate ideas. Let this be a step in the right direction.
1747	4724	2	3	I believe that everyone has their right to their own opinion. If a parent does not think that their kid should do something, then they simply shouldn't let them. It kind of reminds me of how some people are against hunting. If you don't like it, then don't do it. If everyone would express their own opinion, the world would be a much better place. If I don't like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 that I don't like him, then @PERSON1 knows where I stand, and he won't talk to me anymore. In a broader context, if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that they don't like them, @LOCATION2 will not try to befriend @LOCATION1. So, if everyone would speak their mind, the world would be a far better place. If a parent does not like something like a particular type of music, movie, or even a book and they express this to their kid, the child will learn that that thing is not good. My dad taught me that it was okay to kill animals only if I was willing to eat them, and that seems reasonable to me. However, other people might not think it's right. So, I believe that if you're not a hypocrite and live as you teach your kids to, your kids will listen to you. As I've said before, my dad taught me that it's fine to kill animals if I'm willing or going to eat them. I find one exception to this rule: coyotes. We have a lot of coyotes where I live, and they can be a real nuisance. I believe that is about the only exception to the rule because coyotes are problem animals in this area. So, if you don't want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies, then block them on TV. It's the same principle for other things like magazines, books, and music. In conclusion, respecting individual opinions and being consistent in our teachings can lead to a more harmonious world where everyone understands and respects each other's boundaries.
1748	4725	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a highly debated topic today. Many people are constantly wondering what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With numerous @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 factors in today's society, it is extremely difficult to find something that is not offensive to someone's culture. Three main reasons why we struggle to find a reasonable yet non - offensive book for our children in libraries include @CAPS1, @CAPS2 beliefs, and @CAPS3 beliefs. @CAPS1 was a major issue in the late @NUM1's to early @DATE1's. Thanks to @LOCATION2, slavery was abolished in the @LOCATION1. However, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films being published today. If someone doesn't put an end to these harsh comments, they will never stop. Even though it's not as prominent an issue today, it doesn't mean it won't continue. Children should not have to see or hear racist comments directed at their race, just as many of their ancestors did. Harsh put - downs and negative comments about @CAPS2 beliefs are also inappropriate for society, let alone for children to read. Books containing such content are not suitable for children and should be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader, my biggest passion is learning about other cultures to understand what it would be like to live in another country. There are countless religions in the world today, each with its own set of beliefs and deities. I believe it is important for children in the modern world to freely celebrate their own religion as they wish. However, it is not right to make hateful remarks about other religions. Unfortunately, children may come across such content in books. They should not be reading false information about religions and forming incorrect assumptions in their minds. It's definitely a good idea to place such materials in the @NUM2 section. For now, children should be provided with materials that they can easily understand and find interesting. It would be a great idea to have a fiction section specifically for kids and a @NUM2 section for both kids and adults. One option to consider is that every local public library could hold a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in an easily accessible form or not. This decision is ultimately up to you. By taking these steps, we can ensure that libraries are a safe and appropriate place for children to learn and grow.
1749	4726	2	3	Every single person has their own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music, or anything in life. What might be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion may not be so in others' views. Everyone has their own opinions about books, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship in a public place like a library can be a good thing. By censoring materials in libraries or video stores, we're helping to prevent a lot of potential trouble and concerns in the future. However, censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library can also have its drawbacks. Not everyone likes the same things or is interested in the same movies or books. At the same time, we can't censor every single thing that someone doesn't like. If we remove something just because one parent complains that their child watched or read something they thought was too 'vulgar', then we're giving that power to every parent who has a complaint. It's not the library's responsibility to monitor every child and ensure they only consume what their parents want them to. Kids will be kids and will do what they want. Censoring and removing items from library shelves doesn't prevent children from watching inappropriate movies or reading unsuitable books. It's similar to censoring words in movies; it doesn't stop children from hearing or learning vulgar language. In today's world, children hear more vulgar words in school than in movies and television. What does the word 'offensive' really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on what's offensive and what's not. As I've said, everyone has their own views on life and everything in it. We can't remove everything from the shelves just because one parent thinks it's not right for their child or other children to see, look at, or listen to. We all have the freedom to look at what we want and listen to the music we like. By removing items that some people like while others don't, we're taking away that right as a @CAPS1 citizen. Censoring certain things like sex scenes in movies or vulgar language in music is acceptable in my opinion. But taking books off the shelf just because you don't like the way it's written, the author, or the language used is going too far. Books teach kids new things every day and spark their imagination. By removing books from shelves, I think we're hindering a child's ability to grow. In conclusion, censorship is a double - edged sword. It can have both positive and negative impacts. We need to find a balance and make reasonable decisions about what to censor and what to leave accessible.
1750	4727	2	3	This is a matter of personal thought. Some people can be content with certain things, while others strongly disagree. Unless something is racist or sexist, no one has the right to say that it doesn't belong. If someone doesn't like a book, they should simply walk away instead of questioning why it's there, as someone else might want it. So, I don't particularly like this topic, but I'm okay with writing about it. It's not really a choice, just like it shouldn't be a choice for people to dictate what belongs where, unless it's rightfully owned by the individual. I know there are many things I don't like, but I don't try to get them moved or banned. They're there because people want to read them. Moreover, the person who wrote or created the item would be deeply hurt (@CAPS1 of sadness or rejection). When it comes to insulting a race and/or being sexist, if that's present in a book, it should be stopped and removed. People have the right to voice their unhappiness about such content. But if they just don't like the topic while others do, they should move on and not make a big deal out of it. If the title @CAPS2 clearly indicates what the book is about, then just walk away and ignore it. People might use it for research or other purposes in the future. Unfortunately, some people can be self - centered and only think about their own needs. They might cause a huge, @CAPS3 or fight over trivial things. I imagine this is why this topic of censorship came up, as these are the people who have always had things handed to them. So, these are my thoughts and beliefs about the topic of censorship. It doesn't matter whether it's in school or at a library; an item is there because someone is or was interested in it. I know that people may completely think what I've written is stupid, while others may think it's smart. It all depends on the culture you grew up in and the @CAPS1 of mind you're in at that particular time and place. In the end, we should respect different opinions and only take action against truly offensive content.
1751	4728	2	3	I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people, especially during @MONTH1, find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things. Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go to the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 CDs should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some people, during @MONTH1, find them offensive but others greatly appreciate it. Some people, during @MONTH1, may be interested in these topics. Just like some people, during @MONTH1, may be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be fair for libraries to remove these materials from the library, and deny the people that do like them the right to rent these materials. Another factor is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading a book or viewing movies that may be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then there is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else, during @MONTH1, may find those materials offensive is no reason to take them off the shelf. I can see why some parents, during @MONTH1, may be upset that their kids may see some of the things in the library that may not be appropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have had a special area for kids' materials. If the parents were worried about their kids seeing some of the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area. I don't think that these materials that may seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be offended by something and it is not fair to deprive others of those materials even if it is offensive to some. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection to respect the varied interests and rights of all patrons.
1752	4729	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportunities and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, and no two people are the same. First of all, when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore, it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is meant by this statement is that there are so many different types of writing that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library. If someone has gotten a book that seems to be their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is property of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner, let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth, they will not be the only ones who have that opinion. It takes one person to make the difference. Books are not made for just one person; they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their opinions and will stick by them. That's expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse opinions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressing them either, actually it's better that way only because then others can hear about a book and either agree with that opinion or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing they really like. Books, yes, can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their opinion. To spread an opinion is to let the world know where someone stands on a specific topic. Without that, the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinion. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one. In conclusion, maintaining an uncensored library environment is essential for the free exchange of ideas and the exploration of diverse literary works.
1753	4730	2	3	Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1. (I changed the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.) To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3, I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all that serious I guess. It seems the librarians there are censoring tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1. They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is too bloody and scary for some of the other readers. There have also been some complaints from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie. To that I said well, can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have already blocked all the inappropriate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go for me at school. So then I tried to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have already censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the weird adult - rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more. I also threw in the idea of separating all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child, teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3. The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works. But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw how big the censor list was it was like a nightmare, over a hundred pages of books at least. I was too scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was too big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then I put up posters at the school I go to, to see if anyone else would be willing to help me. So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I thank you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing to. In conclusion, with more help, we can achieve a better - organized and more accessible library collection.
1754	4731	2	3	I think that if there are offensive books, music, magazines, etc., then they should be put in a section of their own, or the librarians should have them kept up and if someone needs/wants them then they would have to go to the front desk in order to get them. This way, the general public can easily avoid these materials if they wish. I think also, if a young child or teenager can't see, read or hear those types of things then they should not be in the general access area. By separating these offensive materials, we can ensure that those who are interested in them can still access them, while protecting the sensibilities of others, especially the younger patrons. This approach strikes a balance between freedom of access and the need to maintain a suitable environment for all library users. In conclusion, this method of handling offensive materials in libraries is a practical and fair solution.
1755	4732	2	3	Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well, many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more censorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You, during @MONTH1, may never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just censor them. Censoring seems like a no - brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book. People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves. Instead of banning the books or complaining about them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it. You, during @MONTH1, may not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and schools more censored then all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure. In conclusion, implementing a censorship and rating system in libraries can enhance the reading experience for all while respecting diverse opinions and rights.
1756	4733	2	3	Offensive materials can be anything, but here I'm specifically talking about what's inside libraries. Books, music, movies, and magazines can be offensive to some individuals, yet not to everyone. Removing these materials from library shelves just because a few people view them as offensive isn't a good idea. After all, if some find it offensive, there are others who are enjoying it. Not every person will find a particular book, song, movie, or magazine offensive. For this reason, no books, CDs, movies, or magazines should be withheld from the public in any library. My friends liked reading @PERSON1's books, but I didn't, yet I didn't stop them from reading. Just like 'To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3,' it might be offensive to some, but if you find it so, simply don't read it. There will always be someone who doesn't want their kid to watch a certain movie or read a @PERSON1 book, but that's not a valid reason to remove materials from the library shelves. Let people read what they want, watch what they want, and listen to what they want. There's no good reason to remove a book from the library shelves. We all have the right to read, watch, and listen to whatever we please. Having someone you've never seen get a book, movie, or magazine removed from the library because they find it a bit offensive is like having someone kick you because you don't have much money. Many books from around the world can be considered offensive to at least one person, and those one or maybe two people have no right to tell others what they can't read. Censorship in libraries is a terrible idea because not everyone will read that book or listen to that CD. Having a chance to read a book or listen to a song that could change our lives, for better or worse, should be our choice. Any material can be considered 'offensive,' but most of it isn't truly offensive; it's just what some people don't want their kids to read. Offensive or non - offensive materials can't be declared by a few people; it should be determined by an entire country. What one person considers offensive, another might consider life - changing. Anything can make someone change, and to have that chance, we should have the freedom to read whatever we like. If you find a book offensive, remember that you had a chance to read it, so give that chance to someone else. In conclusion, the freedom to access diverse materials in libraries is essential for personal growth and the exchange of ideas, and we should respect this right for everyone.
1757	4734	2	3	Today's world is filled with racism and criticism. In every aspect of our daily life, anything we do is often labeled as either right or wrong, with no middle ground. Whenever you're out to eat at a cozy restaurant or shopping in a bustling mall, you can hear offensive comments or see offensive images all around you. The newspaper, the news on TV, and the internet often make events seem worse than they actually are. When these media cover events related to certain people, those people may take it offensively. If you go out looking for a good book to read during your leisure time, or a movie to watch on a lazy evening, or music to listen to while lying in bed, you pick what interests you. When you're looking through the selection, you're bound to see and recognize titles or pictures that offend you. I know that when I come across such things, I pick the object up and read what's on the back. In some way, someone is going to find a movie, music, books, or a magazine offensive. Say we take everything off the shelves of every store that is offensive in any way to people. What would be left on the shelves? Nothing. Authors have the right to write about anything they want, and singers have the right to sing about what they want. In the @ORGANIZATION1, every single person has the freedom of speech. So libraries can't take something off the shelves just because someone deems it offensive. That's the whole point of having different genres of music and reading materials, so you can read and listen to what you want. Every individual has the choice of what they pick up and listen to or read. If someone finds something offensive, then they shouldn't pick the object up. Then, when that person complains about it, the bottom line is that it's their fault for reading it. There's going to be offensive things said about race, culture, looks, and weight. That's just a part of life and how people act these days. There comes a point when you have to be the bigger person and ignore it and move on. So, no, I do not believe that offensive books, music, or magazines should be removed from libraries or stores. We have the choice to pick what we read and listen to, and we should exercise this choice responsibly.
1758	4735	2	3	I think that if the books, music, magazines, or movies in a library are not offensive, then the library has the right to put them on the shelves. There's nothing wrong with having music and magazines at a library. For instance, what if someone doesn't like to read but loves listening to music, or doesn't like to read books but likes to read magazines? I think it's also all right to have movies. They could have a lot of educational movies, which can teach people various knowledge, or just some plain regular movies of all kinds, like comedies, dramas, and action films. Now, if a book, movie, magazine, or music is found to be offensive, then it should be taken off the shelf. If the books, music, movies, or magazines are not offensive in any way, they have the right to be on those shelves so that everyone can use them. In conclusion, libraries should carefully curate their collections, keeping non - offensive materials available for the public to access and enjoy, while removing truly offensive ones.
1759	4736	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or heard. These so - called 'offensive' objects that we have in libraries can teach us very useful things. For example, they can teach us about what to do and what not to do in different situations and can also teach us about our own history or another country's history. It is true that there are some things in a library that children shouldn't see yet, but what's to stop them from taking a look anyway? There are people who crave this offensive knowledge but are told time and time again that they are not old or mature enough to handle such things. However, in more ways than one, and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the truth that holds violence than having it hidden from them. Without these materials, children will never know what is really going on in the world around them. If they end up in the middle of something dangerous and don't have the correct knowledge on how to handle it or where to go, they'll be too shocked to do anything. That is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library. In conclusion, these materials, despite their potentially offensive nature, play a crucial role in educating people about the real world and preparing them for various situations.
1760	4737	2	3	I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor certain works, but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can't take a work off the shelf is quite simple. If one person hates the work but everyone else likes it, imagine how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was destroyed. Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their hard - worked - on works were being destroyed without any thought for others? I can, and I feel horrible just thinking about it. So, I believe that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the decision if their work should be saved or destroyed. With these reasons that I have shared with you, please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything. Whether it's a well - written book, an engaging movie, a beautiful song, or even a child's innocent dreams, think about how they would feel if anything of theirs was destroyed. In conclusion, respecting the rights of the creator and the feelings of the audience is crucial when it comes to the fate of creative works.
1761	4738	2	3	Dear reader, Do you believe that certain books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive? A lot of people in the world today are grappling with this very question. Some parents firmly think they should be removed, but others vehemently argue they should stay. I'm going to tell you what I think.  As a citizen, I know some parents are passionately arguing that certain magazines and books should be removed from the library if they are found offensive. Well, if they do that, then there wouldn't be anything left on the shelves, and the library would ultimately be shut down. I mean, I see where some of the parents are coming from. Some of these things are truly offensive and not appropriate for children. But if you don't want your children to see it, then keep them away from that section of the library or don't bring them. You go get the book or magazine they want and then bring it back home for them.  In the world today, everything is offensive to someone. I mean, everyone has their own thoughts on what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive. So eventually, if you were to take everything offensive out of the library, it would be emptied out. I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author is saying: 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have the exact same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (@PERSON1). I don't know about you, but this really sums it all up for me.  The truth is you can't always do what you want. You just have to live with the way it is and try to make it better for yourself and your family. If you read this article and really listen and take into consideration what I'm saying, I think you'll find that it would be a lot easier for you to just act like the offensive books and magazines aren't there. Because if you try to get them taken out, you won't even be able to go to the library anymore.  Sincerely, the one and only, @PERSON2.
1762	4739	2	3	I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing, but can go too far. Removing movies and magazines that contain blatantly pointless offensive material from the shelves could indeed be a good thing. If those are removed, I do not think that people would care that much. Removing those small things, however, could gradually grow into a bigger problem. It has to be carefully decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves.  It all starts with a bad magazine that has a shockingly bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive, with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental. A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they firmly believe it is not appropriate, so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf. Then a movie arises that is offensive, and it is also taken off the shelf. Pretty soon, everyone is coming in with minor complaints about many different things, and almost everything has someone who wants it banned.  Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned, people would still complain until what they want happens. If the government has all these complaints, they might just shut down the libraries to avoid painstakingly looking over every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork. The original purpose of blocking out offensive material ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody. Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some.  In the end, a library should not be given the right to censor anything. The things that should be censored are a very small percentage, and it is not worth the risk. Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others. Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired. The library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the reader's hand. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse nature of library collections and let readers make their own choices.
1763	4740	2	3	What @CAPS1 You Do? A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive material to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very significant issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive material should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be okay for 'offensive' material to be on the shelves of the libraries across the @ORGANIZATION1.  What is considered offensive? Each and every person has their own unique view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child in @MONTH1 might think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word, while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive material from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 on the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a different view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non - offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.  There are a lot of websites and organizations that clearly state what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the library's own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not approve of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.  In conclusion, I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really, the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?' The question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?' It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the library's own responsibility to be a strict guardian to all of its customers. Let the libraries be!
1764	4741	2	3	I believe that offensive books should be taken off the shelf. Some books are offensive and some are inappropriate. The librarian could carefully get rid of the books, so the little kids can't @CAPS2 get the inappropriate book. Movies that are rated '@CAPS1' and above should be removed. Anything that has an 'A' rating should be removed. The libraries are a public place to rent and return, buy or sell, or to trade movies, books, and so on. Keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental well - being.  Anything inappropriate could be censored by a black marker. The old library I used to go to had all the slang, curse - words, and such, all marked out with a black sharpie. Some of the movies with a rating of '@CAPS2' and all the above were thrown out. The magazines had marks on the pages also, censoring the slang in the magazine. The music at the library was selectively blocked. Some music was not blocked, and the rest were the censored parts of the songs. The libraries should do the same as the old one did. By taking these steps, libraries can create a more suitable environment for all visitors, especially the young ones.
1765	4742	2	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1, and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries quite often, and things that I see in there I feel shouldn't be in there. Like the movies. They're okay, but they're all sitting together. So that means me, being a young lady, I see things that I know my mother wouldn't approve of me even looking at. They have censored movies just sitting there, seemingly without any proper segregation.  I even go through the shelves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldn't even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like it's a normal book about @CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they don't see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I don't think or feel that there should be censored books in the library and children are able to look at them. That's not right at all.  As far as the music, I agree with having music at libraries because many people listen to different types of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be very careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldn't know how to respond to a song that's talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what their parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I don't feel that really nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.  I don't believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one of the main censored things in the library. There are many of them, along with books. They shouldn't be there at all, just for the sake of the children and parents. They don't need to grow up fast. They need to enjoy their life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things, that's not helping at all.  In conclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries. What I'm just asking you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there. They can even make their own section of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only. I know that this is the right thing, and I know many people agree with me. People only want the best for their children, and a library with a lot of censored things in there doesn't sound like the best. That just means they are starting off wrong. By taking action, we can make libraries a more family - friendly and positive place. Sincerely: A student who believes in changes.
1766	4743	2	3	Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as well - written books, engaging magazines, captivating movies, or soul - stirring music. Different types of these works of literature hold unique significance for each person. If everyone had the absolute right to completely remove one piece of work that displeased them, then no works would remain on the shelves. Therefore, I firmly believe no materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necessities, and preferences.  A few years ago, I had a classmate who held different ideas from a large number of people on religious persecution. He strongly hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place. He painstakingly wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive. Even though I wholeheartedly disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been genuinely interested to read them. There could even have been valuable ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems. I believe it is grossly unfair that his paper was rejected.  People have different necessities based on what they have to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book last month about a girl who was doing a project on racism. She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in South Africa but couldn't find anything. She politely asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl might not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing.  Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others. Literature should be able to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that right. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire.  In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and always will want, need, and desire different things. Works of literature are just one of them. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should never be removed from public places. These things are necessities to the world as they enrich our lives and broaden our perspectives.
1767	4744	2	3	I THINK THAT IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFENSIVE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T READ IT. CAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THAT BOOK. MAYBE IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM, MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THEIR LIFE. WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY, NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET; THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES. SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU, MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE AUTHOR AND TALK TO HIM/HER ABOUT THEIR BOOK. THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRITING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK. ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HIS OR HER BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO, NO, I DON'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVES BECAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN. REMOVING A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES RESTRICTS THE ACCESS OF THOSE WHO MIGHT FIND VALUE IN IT. EVERY BOOK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TOUCH SOMEONE'S LIFE IN A POSITIVE WAY, AND WE SHOULD NOT DEPRIVE OTHERS OF THAT OPPORTUNITY.
1768	4745	2	3	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' YES, these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive. First off, they should be removed because some people may be offended by them. Some materials may talk about race, religion, or gender in a way that is hurtful or inappropriate. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, a lot of it is just people talking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people may be offended, and I'm sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that kind of content. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such, that item can have a bad effect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, and some people just cannot help their religion; they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and downsize them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some people may take offense to that. So just take pictures of the celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion, in some of my observations and reading, some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive to protect the feelings and well - being of the public.
1769	4746	2	3	Do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive? In my opinion, I do not agree and I think they should not be able to take them off the shelves. Many people have different thoughts and opinions, and I am going to state mine in the next few paragraphs.  To begin with, not everybody likes to read or watch the same types of books or movies. Some like romantic, scary, mysterious, and there are many more selections. For instance, if one person reads something that they do not agree with, that does not mean the next person to read it is not going to like it either. Sometimes I enjoy reading books where people get hurt and sometimes killed, but when someone else reads it, they might think that it is horrible and very offensive.  Another reason is, when I go to the library, I expect to get the book that I want to read, not what others like. One time I went to the library and I was looking for a romantic book to read and I could not find it. So I went up and asked the lady at the counter, and she said they do not have it anymore. I asked why, and she told me a lady found it wrong for children to be reading. In my opinion, maybe that lady did not even like romantic books. They should not make decisions just off of what one person believes.  The next reason is, the library put the movie or book on the shelf in the first place because they thought people would enjoy it. The writer or producer would not be very happy if he found out that his/her movie or book got taken out of the library because they found it offensive. Just give the book a chance and see how everybody likes it. I understand if everybody thought it was really offensive to take it off, but not just one person.  To end with, my belief is that if they had the book in their library at one time, it should just stay in there till it gets old and falls apart. The library is open to any and every type of books, not just boring ones. So I believe the books should not get taken off the shelves; they should just stay right where they're supposed to be. If they do not like the book or movie, then suggest to other people's families not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction. By allowing a wide range of materials in the library, we can respect the diverse preferences of all library users.
1770	4747	2	3	When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document.  I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears are forever turning. Often I look to other artists' works for inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit. It was not the lyrics or foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein! It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey.  We should not discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry. We should not throw away a moving song because of its lyrics. We should not trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance. How fair is this? Even now there may be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor. That is not fair in my right mind.  I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind. All things have a story to tell. A friend of mine once said to me, that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable. We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret. To reject leaves you no smarter. To ignore leaves you in fear. However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or new person. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt. Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us. If you do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical? We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world. By allowing a diverse range of materials in libraries, we can foster a more informed and open - minded society.
1771	4748	2	3	No, materials should not be removed from the libraries. First, most of the books, movies, and music are the best way to support different things. They all have their own way of convincing you. There are many different ways to understand, but those are certainly the best ways. For instance, a movie. Some people like to see things to understand them. Because it takes time for some people to visualize instead of just reading or listening. Sitting and watching a movie is a great way. However, some people who view a movie from the wrong perspective get the wrong kind of thought about something, which makes it offensive to them.  Like music, it is a great way to understand what someone is trying to say or get across. You have to take time out to really listen and hear what they are talking about. If you hear a song once and then take it the wrong way, you never let your mind fully process what they said. Some people let one or two words make them think differently about the song. So before you judge, listen to the whole song.   A book is one of the world's best ways to understand where someone is coming from. A book is like a short life. If you judge a book by its first couple of paragraphs, you would never get the meaning out of it. With a book, you have to give it a chance to sink into your mind so that you do get an understanding. A book can tell you a lot of things. Yet, some people take it offensive.   These types of materials should never be removed from libraries. These things are great ways to understand things. So if you take one thing offensive, try another way; maybe it's a better way for people to understand it. Without these materials, we would never understand or discover anything in our world.
1772	4749	2	3	When you think of a book, do you think of happy kids' books, or mysterious dark books? What if I was to say offensive books? Most magazines, music, books, and movies you pick off the shelf today are not as happy or mysterious as you might initially think.   When I think of a movie I want to watch, I think of something that I'm going to enjoy; not something I'm going to shut off in the middle of it. What if you pick a movie that looks good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good, but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother, it's the exact opposite. Do you turn it in? Do you turn it off and waste your money without doing anything about it?   Offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store. If you're not going to finish it, then why is it there? I'm not going to watch or read a book if it's not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good. If people can sit there and write it, act it, or play it, then we should be able to speak our opinion on whether it's good or not.   People have feelings. If they're going to be hurt by something we should enjoy, then take them off the shelves. Do something about it. We all should have the satisfaction of doing something for other people, and if not that, then for ourselves. By removing offensive materials, we can create a more positive and enjoyable environment for everyone.
1773	4750	2	3	There should not be censorship on the books in the library. Just think of how many great pieces of literature are out there that no one would be able to get their hands on because they didn't reach your standards. People wouldn't be able to read some of their favorite books. Would you really want to take that from the people?   If my argument didn't change your mind, you could at least put the censored books behind the counter. This way, those who are interested in accessing them can still do so, while also respecting the concerns of others. Censorship limits the freedom of knowledge and exploration, and it's important to find a balance that allows for both the protection of certain sensibilities and the availability of diverse literature. In conclusion, the negative impacts of censorship on the availability of great literature far outweigh any potential benefits, and alternative solutions like the behind - the - counter approach should be considered.
1774	4751	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how inappropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything, they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says something along the lines of 'adult content.' History repeats itself, and this quote reminds me of periods in history where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the Holocaust, and the racial discrimination in the deep south.  What about the Holocaust, when six million Jews were killed because they were Jews. Some Jews might find these books offensive, but that doesn't mean the Holocaust never happened. There are many offensive and controversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the Holocaust. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our children to learn about what happened. And other categories need to be read because it can help children to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.  The racial discrimination started from the 1860's all the way until the civil rights movement in the 1960s. The racial discrimination took a toll on everyone in the United States, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most white people treated African - Americans as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of laws called the 'Jim Crow laws,' which pretty much was a list of laws to treat African - Americans as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, then throughout their whole life growing up, they would realize that what white people did to African - Americans was unethical.  Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our children their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their children when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their children go to school and hear other children talk about subjects such as sex? Children could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your 8 - year - old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when children get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.  It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their children, or hovering over their shoulders like helicopters. If children don't learn the truth about the real world and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the world, when they go to college they won't be able to stand up for themselves. If children don't learn about history and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the Jews and the African - Americans were treated. Just because these books are different than others, we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the Jews and African - Americans because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman. By keeping these materials in libraries, we ensure that future generations have the opportunity to learn from the past and build a better future.
1775	4752	2	3	Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library if the item is inappropriate. I believe that libraries should not have censorship.   I personally think that it should be up to the library to decide if they could have that power. If it is a library where there are always smaller children present, then I think they could have the power of censorship. However, in conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropriate for their son or daughter.   Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of grown - ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for censorship. First and foremost, because it's your choice of the item. If you think it is offensive, then simply do not read it, watch it, or listen to it.   Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. Also, people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it in general.   Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left.   In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough to check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken off the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. Therefore, I believe censorship is not needed in libraries as it would disrupt the free access to diverse materials and create unnecessary chaos.
1776	4753	2	3	I know that some people find certain books offensive, as they may contain mean, cruel, or racist content. However, most of the time, people write these books because it's what they genuinely feel or what their audience wants to read. Books are a privilege, and we should be able to exercise that privilege. People need to understand that it's okay if books are sometimes a bit harsh. The real world is not the most friendly place, and books can convey that reality with less emotional harm than experiencing it firsthand.   I firmly believe that all books should remain on the shelves. Just because a book is offensive to someone doesn't mean it should be removed. For every book, there will always be someone who finds it offensive for some reason. If the criterion is offensiveness, then all books would have to be removed. If an author takes the time to write a book and ensures its accuracy, why should we prevent people from reading it? They have the right to write, and we have the right to read, and no one should take away these rights.   For instance, if someone writes a book about the Holocaust, many people may be offended by it, but they don't try to get rid of the book. So, why should any other book be treated differently just because it's not about a major event? It's truly absurd that some people go to such lengths to ban a book just because they're offended by it. I think they should just accept it and move on. If they don't like a book, they don't have to read it. But they shouldn't take away the opportunity for others who do want to read it.   I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in our library, and they were told, 'Oh, you can't read that because it was found to be offensive.' It really upset me that they could decide how someone else feels about a book. It's infuriating that they think they can determine others' opinions. They must think they're magic because I didn't know they could know how someone else feels about a book or anything else.   In our library, we do have some books kept behind the librarian's desk. If someone really wants to read those books, they're available. I'm okay with this arrangement because at least it preserves the option for those who want to read them. This is what I think should be done with books that are considered too offensive. We should at least make an effort to preserve our rights as citizens.   Let's also consider the financial aspect. The books we want to remove from the library were most likely paid for by taxpayers like us. So, we and many others have already invested in these books, and it's insane to waste that money just because someone is offended. It makes me wonder if people really want to get so worked up over a book. Does it really make them feel better to get rid of a book and waste the money?   In conclusion, I'm extremely disappointed that some people go to such lengths to ban books from libraries. If you were an author and people did this to your work, how would you feel? You'd probably feel like your hard work was being disrespected. People need to calm down and think about the bigger picture, not just their own feelings. They should ask themselves, 'Will this really affect me if I let the book stay on the shelf?' It also angers me that the library spends money on books, and then they're removed. This is how I feel about the issue of book banning.
1777	4754	2	3	Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from library shelves simply because they personally disagree with the content? The question of library censorship doesn't have a clear - cut answer. Some individuals firmly believe it's within their rights to eliminate books, music, and movies that they consider 'offensive'. On the other hand, there are those who argue that library censorship is wrong and that people should have unrestricted access to any material they desire. Censorship essentially acts as a barrier, preventing those eager to learn about different worlds from accessing knowledge.  In today's society, there are virtually no limits to human creativity. The human imagination can craft beautiful literary masterpieces and music, but it can also generate content that isn't suitable for all age groups. Library censorship is often seen as a way to shield young and inquisitive minds from this 'unsuitable' material. However, what might be inappropriate for children could be perfectly acceptable for a mature adult. Censorship is purely a matter of personal opinion.  For example, if a person strongly believes that a higher power created the world in seven days, they might find a book or movie supporting the theory of evolution offensive. Similarly, if a parent doesn't want their child exposed to a certain type of media, they'd prefer that it not be visible in the children's section of the library. But it's unfair to others if all related content is removed just because one person has an issue with it. If someone doesn't want to access certain 'offensive' subjects, they can simply avoid them. It's not their right to deny others the opportunity to educate themselves on those matters.  Writing is a powerful form of self - expression. It allows individuals to convey their feelings, thoughts, and share knowledge about the past. But if written works aren't shared, how can people form their own opinions when they're not exposed to diverse viewpoints? It's unjust to prevent someone from learning about a particular subject just because a few others oppose the content. If books and movies that one person finds unacceptable were removed, then everyone else could claim the right to have their disliked material removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left in the library because everyone is offended by something.  One of the great things about being a citizen in our society is the freedom of speech. By living here, we have the right to read and learn about whatever we choose. Censorship restricts the learning opportunities of those who are eager to expand their knowledge.  Parents are often the most vocal advocates of library censorship. Their concern about protecting their children from explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because a parent doesn't want their child to see a movie about a controversial topic doesn't mean they have the right to stop others from viewing it. Children need to be exposed to different ideas at some point to develop open - mindedness and acceptance. Libraries are a valuable source for young people to learn about different religions, beliefs, and customs. It shouldn't be up to parents to decide what goes on the library shelves. If they don't want their children to access certain subjects, they can keep them away from the library.  In conclusion, library censorship is a subjective matter. Citizens have the right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they want. While it's reasonable for parents to shield their children, it's unacceptable for them to prevent the entire community from learning. The freedom to express oneself through literature is meaningless if that literature can't be shared. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' highlighting the potential consequence of excessive censorship.
1778	4755	2	3	Why do we have books, magazines, movies, and music that are considered offensive in the world? Some might wonder that if they're inappropriate, why do we keep them around? Well, in our society, people have moved on from the more innocent days of shows like those from @CAPS1 - duty time, @PERSON1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Unfortunately, a lot of the media today is inappropriate for younger viewers.  Back in the day, around @DATE1 @TIME1, the good cartoons like @CAPS4, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, etc., used to be on. These cartoons, which I used to watch, taught me important values like being @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @CAPS8. But now, they've faded away. The so - called 'good' cartoons for children today mostly show the same negative things. They display @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and other deadly sins without providing any real life - lessons for the kids. It's just a mindless display of vices, and that's truly disappointing.  We can't completely eliminate offensive media. We can't make all books disappear from the shelves, force directors to stop directing, make rappers stop rapping, or end the porn industry. However, we can restrict it to a certain extent. Whether through the black market or adult stores, this kind of content will always be available.  Thankfully, there are ways to protect our children. We can set restrictions on televisions. In libraries, we can move offensive books and magazines to a restricted area where only those over @NUM2 years old can access them.  Now, let's talk about music. A lot of today's music can be extremely offensive. I grew up listening to old - fashioned country music, and unfortunately, country music has taken a turn for the worse. The change in music started during the @LOCATION2 @CAPS13 era with the hippies. While they were under the influence of @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @CAPS16, they introduced new forms of music like @CAPS17 and @CAPS18. This kind of offensive music has been around for over @NUM3 years, and it's not going to disappear easily. All we can do is hope that our children don't turn on the radio tuned to such music and think it's good.  Pornographic magazines have been around for a long time, since @PERSON2 was in her prime. No matter what we do, they're not going to stop existing. We can only try to block them from our children's view. We can't completely eliminate them, but we can at least try to keep them out of our children's reach.  I think we should move offensive materials to restricted areas in libraries. Then, we can address the issue of offensive music and inappropriate shows. We need to remember that this kind of content will always be out there, but as responsible adults, we should try to keep it away from our children. With determination, we can make a difference and protect our children from the negative influence of offensive media. It's not an easy task, but it's definitely worth the effort.
1779	4756	2	3	Libraries: A Place of Learning or a Source of Offense?  This world is full of diverse ideas, but it's absurd that some of our ideas are blocked because they're considered offensive. There are many offensive things in libraries, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. If people find these offensive, they should take action and voice their concerns instead of just complaining.  Libraries are supposed to be places where people can relax and pick up a good book. However, there's a problem when someone stumbles upon a highly offensive book. And it's even more concerning when kids are in the library. They might accidentally come across an inappropriate movie. Such things have no place in a public library.  As a citizen, I believe that offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. Why are they even there in the first place? It makes one wonder what's happening to our society. Many of today's books need to be censored because they contain a lot of foul language that kids might pick up.  The same goes for music. Some of the lyrics in modern music can be extremely offensive. When rock stars, rappers, and other musicians write their lyrics, they often don't consider how others will perceive them. They just use the worst language possible in their songs, only caring about making money. We should take a stand and ask them to censor their lyrics. We could even write letters to express our concerns.  All materials in libraries, including books, movies, and magazines, should be carefully checked. Some of this content shouldn't even be displayed. For example, a magazine that talks a lot about sex, drugs, and other inappropriate topics might be appealing to some adults, but it's completely wrong for a twelve - year - old boy to pick it up and start reading. This kind of material has no place in a public library.  I've been to a library myself, and I've noticed some inappropriate things. At first, I didn't think much of it. But when I saw an eleven - year - old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence, it really worried me. He might be influenced by what he reads and be tempted to try those things in real life. It's shocking that such content is in a library.  This is where censorship comes in. By editing and censoring a lot of the materials in the library, we can protect the younger generation from being exposed to inappropriate content. People today don't seem to care enough, but they should start taking this issue more seriously.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that it's wrong to have so much offensive content in a public library. Kids don't need to see this kind of material. We need to take action to ensure that libraries remain safe and educational places for everyone.
1780	4757	2	3	I believe that if certain books, music, or magazines are considered offensive and some people don't like them, those people should consider removing themselves from the library. There are countless things out there that different people enjoy reading and listening to. If someone doesn't like what they find at a particular library, there are plenty of other libraries around that might have a different selection.  If a person is offended by what they see at a library, why would they keep going back? What might be offensive to some isn't offensive to all. If people try to fight for the removal of these materials, the people who like them will be angry because they enjoy reading or listening to them and have a great time doing so. As I've said before, if you don't like something, there are other libraries where you might find more suitable content.  Libraries should have the freedom to decide what to put on their shelves. They could place the potentially offensive materials in the back, and those who want them can ask for them. Or they could clearly mark the area where these materials are located, so if someone doesn't like them, they don't have to go near that section. There are multiple shelves in a library, so if you don't like what's on one
1781	4758	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't think so. These items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over the age of eighteen, you should be able to pick and choose whatever topic you want. You have the maturity and the right to explore different ideas and perspectives. If you are under the age of eighteen, there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent. For those under eighteen when they get a library membership, they should have to verify their date of birth, and what their parents request their child to be able to read, play, or watch. Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less anger among parents for their children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games. Now if book stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed. It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor. From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For instance, these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. As a result, I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should. He also misbehaves in school constantly. That is just one example of the many I know of. Even if the parent gives permission for their child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age. Some parents make poor decisions on their parenting, and it will reflect on them later in life. So my overall opinion would be no. Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children @DATE1 will not have as many crimes all together. There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse. We should keep this all in mind to create a more responsible and safe environment for everyone.                                                                 @ORGANIZATION1.
1782	4759	2	3	Today in the media, there are many things that can be found offensive. Movies, books, songs, and magazines are a few examples of where someone might find something offensive. These forms of media cover a wide range of topics and themes, which can sometimes clash with an individual's beliefs or values. I believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose. It could be to entertain, educate, or even challenge the audience's thinking. If someone thinks that something is offensive, I think that they should just take what they find offensive away from themselves and not take it away from everyone else also. When a song artist comes up with a song, there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs. Sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience, to express their emotions, or to raise awareness about an issue. When someone finds a movie offensive, there is a reason for why it is the way it is; it's to get a point across. If people find the movie offensive, they just simply shouldn't subject themselves to it. If they don't watch the movie, they won't have anything to be offended about. Certain books in libraries are found offensive to some people just because they don't agree with what is in them. If there is something in a book that you don't agree with, you don't just take the book off the shelf and throw it away. Other people might enjoy reading that book. If the book is thrown away, no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away. I do not believe that media that is found offensive to some of the public should be removed. Not everyone finds certain things offensive in the media. Again, everything that is put onto the market and into the media has a purpose; its purpose is to get a point across to others. We should respect the diversity of opinions and allow different voices to be heard in the media.
1783	4760	2	3	Certain books, magazines, music, and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library, like prejudice books or music. Often, music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics. Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents' side. That way, parents can know and control what their children are seeing. Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These signs could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', '@CAPS1 control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put themselves in the public's shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things from a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems. Once when I was in a library, I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that, I thought if there were a sign or something around to warn me, I would not have had to see that. Other things like this have occurred in a library. For example, one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controlled, my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse, like look at an inappropriate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve. These types of occurrences need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in today's libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring @CAPS1 control can reduce, if not eliminate, these unapproved occurrences. By taking these steps, libraries can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all users.
1784	4761	2	3	Offensive things should be taken off for many reasons that will be explained later on. Things in magazines should be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is that it might be offending to someone important, like the president of the @ORGANIZATION1 or the @CAPS1 of your state. These individuals hold positions of power and influence, and showing respect for them is crucial. If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone, they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up, no one will think to change anything. What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines, music, and movies anyway. Even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made-up ideas that people come up with. So if people are offended, it is just pretend to begin with. Offending things in books, well, the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know. For example, in the Newspaper, I read an article about our current president. @PERSON1 was being questioned about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in @LOCATION1. I personally think he was in fact born in the @CAPS2.S. But of course, they did see his certificate that proved he was a member, so that mess should be dropped and forgotten. It was uncalled for to begin with. I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president. We should strive to have a more respectful and appropriate media environment to avoid such unnecessary controversies.
1785	4762	2	3	What if someone found your favorite book offensive? Inappropriate materials do need to be kept from the young minds of children. On the other hand, you cannot shield people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive. So one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves, but another person @MONTH1 sees no problem with it. Children need to be protected from materials that @MONTH1 could hurt them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and copy harmful things they read. Bad influences can even come from magazines with famous celebrities being caught breaking the law or doing bad things. Young minds see that as 'cool' and @MONTH1 might try to follow that example. However, children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, on television, and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protected, but you can't baby - proof life. They will be introduced to plenty of bad influences in their lifetime. It should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. Kids can learn so much worse things from just sitting at home than from something at the library. Libraries are places for public use, and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people. Someone will always find something bothersome with something or another. People have different views, beliefs, and religions, and books on these might be offensive to some but a part of the lifestyle of another. Like the quote by Katherine Paterson said, if we take off the shelves every book or material that someone finds offensive, there will be no books in the libraries at all. Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people, but they should have a right to be read if there is someone who wants to read them. It is not the library's job to be prejudice against certain books just because someone doesn't agree with it. Books should be as diverse as the people who are reading them. Also, children are protected from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices. By promoting a balance between protection and access to diverse materials, we can ensure that libraries remain valuable resources for everyone.
1786	4763	2	3	I believe that any book or movie that is in the library is in the library for a good reason. The world is filled with a wide array of things that can either hurt and make a person feel bad about themselves, or make them feel like they're on top of the world. Yes, there are indeed things that children can see and things that they are not supposed to see. Those inappropriate things are most likely not exposed to the students until they reach a mature and responsible age. Life is full of diverse experiences, and as children grow up, they are going to be taught and shown things that parents might find uncomfortable. Such as: Books that show people with disorders, books about romance, movies with cussing and sex scenes, and violence. Some parents don't even want their children to see a simple kiss on the cheek, which I find really strange because things like that are bound to happen in life. On the other hand, if your child is doing things that they shouldn't be doing, then okay, take action. I also agree that children shouldn't be taught about sex or shown what females and boys have on their bodies. Their minds shouldn't even be set on that. Books, movies, and TV shows shouldn't be removed because they show what life is about and what is going to happen when you get older. In conclusion, we should trust the library's judgment in curating its collection and let children gradually learn about the real world at an appropriate pace.
1787	4764	2	3	Debates are a main part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, which to the people being described in the book might seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures. Our businesses are operating in other countries, many people living in the United States speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that might in fact be offensive to a race of people. Businesses thrive in other countries. A significant portion of our country's income comes from our factories and companies in foreign lands. China is a place where much business happens for the United States. If we, as Americans, can't learn about the Chinese culture, how can we learn their business methods and way of life? To the Chinese, these books might be offensive, but to us they are learning tools describing Chinese culture. Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics. The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the workforce. Learning about their language and habits comes from books. The Mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them. In the United States, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as Americans use freely. Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in the United States. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us. It's a common theme around the globe. Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely. This is the same case with other populations of people. They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted. In conclusion, we should embrace the opportunity to learn from diverse cultures through books, even if they contain potentially offensive content.
1788	4765	2	3	Books are very important to our society. They hold a special place in our hearts, and contain much of our world's knowledge. Everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books. I definitely agree that little children should not purchase a book that has explicit content in it that they should not read. However, some people, myself included, have checked out or bought books and then realized what exactly was portrayed in those books. I do not believe that anything that contains certain contents should be removed from the shelves. I can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves. Any books about the Holocaust and even the African American civil rights movement, such as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' can be taken in the wrong context. These books do contain language that is not appropriate for children. But we do still see them on our shelves. Why? Because those books, and many others, are very important to us. Books should stay on their shelves because, as Katherine Paterson cleverly put it, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This means that if everyone took out books that they felt were personally offensive then there would be no books. Books are vital to learning things. We put all of our knowledge into them, even hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. When the libraries in Alexandria were burned and/or destroyed, we thought our knowledge was gone forever. Thank goodness for the back - up system that no one had known about out in the desert. I myself have read the Bible. I believe it whole - heartedly, but I do know of people who do not believe in God and have taken some things that are said in the Bible to be taken personally. I believe that the Bible is the most important book in the world. Without the Bible no one would know of the wonderful things that our God above has done for us, and what he is doing for us now. However, some people can take what the Bible says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces. But would we allow the gays or divorced men and women to take the Bible off of the shelves? Of course not! If we would not allow them to take off that ever so important book, then why should we allow to have other books to be removed? Books are so very important to us and our world. They hold our world's knowledge, and they also hold our hearts. Just think about what our world, our knowledge, our society would be like if we did not have these precious things. Can you imagine it? I cannot. Books are one of the most important things that we have in our world. Just because someone finds something offensive in a written work does not mean that everyone else will, too. Books, if they are offensive to anyone, should be kept on our shelves for our future generations to come so they can learn and grow on our knowledge of our past. In conclusion, we should preserve the diversity of books in our libraries for the sake of knowledge and future learning.
1789	4766	2	3	In today's world, children are exposed to a lot more inappropriate things than in recent times. They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, being consumed in their work. One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about. Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not. This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. Also, Christian books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. In schools across the country, many Christian authors are not in the public school libraries. By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them. Another issue libraries have is music and movies. It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a CD or even a movie. But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. What can the general public do about this? Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above PG - 13 should be a definite no in libraries. If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out. Magazines also offer a source of learning. Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that are not suited for children. Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. The magazine Playboy, for example, has articles that are too bawdy for students to read. Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation. America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. Society needs to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process. Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not. In conclusion, by implementing strict content regulations in libraries, we can better protect children from inappropriate materials and promote a healthier learning environment.
1790	4767	2	3	This is going to be an essay about if people finding something offensive in a library or in music that it should be censored. It is also about if you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offensive. The way I look at it, or my own opinion, is that they should censor most things from libraries and music, but not get rid of it because one person finds it offensive. If you think about it, those uncensored materials like books that some people find offensive might be a perfect fit for someone else who can relate to them as they were growing up. On the other hand, they should be more careful about it so when younger kids listen to the radio or are reading a book they don't get the wrong ideas. We should censor things but only to an extent and not go overboard with it. In the long run, it might help with creating a more clean and safe population because we are censoring things so that people don't hear bad things and only hear the good in life. You never know, you could make a big difference by doing that. The reason I wouldn't go out and censor everything is because you can't stop everyone from doing it. You can always give it a try but that's one of the main reasons why I wouldn't try and get rid of it just because a certain person might find it offensive. I can understand if you took it off the shelf because someone found it offensive, but only move it to a place where no one will find it offensive. I'm not saying it's wrong to do that, but I think it could and probably would make a lot of people angry. But hey, what can I say? What has the government done that we don't like or can't do anything about it? And that's all I have to say about that. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship that respects different perspectives while protecting the young is the most reasonable way forward.
1791	4768	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, music, etc., make up a substantial part of our entertainment system in our daily lives today. Whether it is informational or purely for entertainment, numerous forms of entertainment can be found in your local library today. In contrast, in the past, most libraries primarily contained only books. However, our entertainment today is significantly different from what it was back then and will also be quite different from what it will be in the future. In today's society, books, magazines, music, movies, and so on can be readily found in your local library, and they contain a wide variety of materials. Some materials could be informational about our solar system or the intricate details of the human body. Other materials could be thrilling fiction stories filled with action, horror, or heart - warming love. Some materials could also be filled with true, life - changing, and inspiring stories. Whichever it may be, these types of things may come off as offensive to some people more than others and may not be appropriate for younger ages. Certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., containing offensive, inappropriate, or rude material shouldn't be banned from libraries just because those younger than adults should not read them, or because those who dislike the material believe that it does not belong in the library. Generally, most libraries are quite large and are well - organized into various sections throughout the building. One area might be dedicated to fiction books and another for non - fiction books. Another area could be for children's books, and yet another for magazines, movies, music, etc., all based on different types and genres. Simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens. Take the books that may contain offensive material, or may be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library. When a book from that section is being checked out, merely ask for an ID from the person checking that book out to make sure that they are of age. This can also apply to movies, magazines, music, and so on that are placed in that section. Some materials found in libraries that may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to others. Taking those offensive materials out of the library won't benefit everyone and may disappoint some of the people who don't find that material offensive. Placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go to benefit everyone. As you can see, just because one person may find certain material in magazines, books, music, movies, etc., offensive, rude, or inappropriate, doesn't mean that everyone else does. It also doesn't mean you should completely take out and get rid of all the materials that are found to contain offensive or inappropriate material. Dividing those specific materials into their own section, and regulating who can check them out is really the best way to go. It benefits everyone at best so that those who want to read that material can still go to their library and check out that book, magazine, and so on, and those who wish to not have anything to do with that certain material don't have to worry about finding material that is offensive or inappropriate, because they will be in their own divided section.
1792	4769	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship. Different sections in the library should be offered. Everyone has different opinions on what they like to read or watch. You should do what you want at your own risk. I think the censorship should not affect the library. The library should offer different sections, namely a kids' side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids' side should offer books that are suitable only for kids by age group. The kids should not have to worry about censorship because they should not be offered anything that a librarian would not want them to see, and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the library. A teen side should not have censorship because a lot of kids are already aware of many things that they shouldn't. So, it would not affect them as much. Books that teenagers read are most likely to have foul language and inappropriate content. When teenagers read or see things, it does not really influence them as much. The music that teenagers listen to, they already know what most of the songs are talking about. So, why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known? An adult side should not have censorship. Adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything. Adults are the ones who have seen and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the shelves. They already know of a lot of things. Why get rid of books that others may read? It is a library, so it should just offer things that would increase intelligence, not decrease it. The censorship is pointless. You should do what you want at your own risk. Things in movies, books, magazines are part of the world. Why try to block out negative things when they are all around you? If someone finds something offensive, then let it be. There are many offensive things in today's society. You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If you are capable of reading it or if it is the right decision, check it out. You enter the library at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection you are going to choose. The library is full of different opinions and a lot of different likes and dislikes. If you should not be looking at something, then it is your opinion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys different things like movies, books, magazines, and music. If the library had a censorship, they would lose a lot of materials all due to the opinions of people that did not care about others' opinions. Everyone enjoys different things and wants a wide variety of the things they like. The library is where you go when you need books, movies, and etc. Why close someone's opinion of a book selection? What if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read? I believe that the censorship should not affect the library. The library should offer different sections for certain age groups. The books, magazines, and music at the library should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has different opinions at the library. The censorship would be a bad decision if they did go through with this decision. The library would not offer as many things and most likely less things would be getting checked out. Therefore, I do think that the censorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries.
1793	4770	2	3	I personally think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First of all, how do we precisely define offensive? Is it something that discriminates against a certain group of people? Is it something that creates negative attention? Is it something we simply don't like? Anybody can walk into a library and find something they did not like, but that does not automatically mean it is offensive. The national geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people, and so does the Playboy magazine. So, which one would we have to put censorship on? The answer is we don't put one because this would start a big argument about which is offensive and which is not. It would cause a conflict between two different sides. It is only offensive when we make it offensive. We do not have to look at something we don't like. We all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive. The Muslims may not get along with the Jews, but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves, they cannot say one's book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs. We sometimes forget we have the amendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press. We may not like what one person publishes, but it doesn't make their work offensive because it might be for a certain group that likes it, which is not offensive to them. Everything in the library has a purpose, and if it does not fit our purpose, then there is no way it would be offensive to us. The library is a place for books, music, movies, magazines, etc. We come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn. We also go to the library to read the newest book of a series. Putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these. We can't finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive, or we can't listen to the new album Dr. Dre released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive. Putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library, then everyone is content. In conclusion, censorship in libraries restricts our access to diverse materials and goes against the principles of freedom of speech and the purpose of a library as a place of knowledge and entertainment.
1794	4771	2	3	We all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine they're not supposed to read. Children don't know any better. But why should we have to have movies, books, and etc. censored just because there are little children everywhere? If I had the right to keep the books and etc. on the shelf, I would. I think that we should be able to have books that are uncensored on the shelves. If everything was censored, we would really have nothing substantial to read or to watch. Having everything censored is just not fair to the world. Everyone should be able to watch whatever they want without it having to be censored. If people's favorite movies or music was censored, it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable to them anymore, and they'll most likely just stop watching or listening to it. I don't believe that they should have a censorship in libraries. Certain materials like CDs and songs do come off a little offensive sometimes, but that's just life. If you think it's offensive, then just don't listen to it. That doesn't mean that they have to take it off the shelf. Maybe other people like that kind of music or etc. That doesn't mean they have the right to just take it off because of that. If they did, that's just really unfair. Children nowadays see more and know more than what they are supposed to know. For example, cursing. If a child happens to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents get mad that it was in the magazine, the parent shouldn't really be mad and take that as offensive, and think that it's not supposed to be there. The library shouldn't have to censor things because of that incident. The children will hear it or see it again sooner or later. I would keep the right for the libraries to have things uncensored if I had the decision. These are some of the reasons why I think they shouldn't have to censor movies, music, etc. in the library. In conclusion, censorship in libraries limits our choices and goes against the idea of personal freedom and the diverse nature of the library as a source of various materials.
1795	4772	2	3	Libraries have a wide variety of material from books to movies. Most of this is intended for a general audience, and many people can read or watch whatever they want. Some of the literature and other material you may find in libraries, however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children. Censorship takes material that these certain people should not read away from everyone. Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life. Censorship is not bad per se, but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general category. Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else. Apart from likes and dislikes, there is the problem of offensiveness. Everyone finds something offensive. Just because you find something that makes a bold statement does not mean that you should persecute someone who is interested in the subject matter. For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet, it is quite simple. Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children can choose material appropriate for their age range. More often than not, I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced upon me. Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading. By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like. This also allows a wide variety of books to reach a wide variety of people. In conclusion, censorship in libraries restricts the free flow of knowledge and entertainment. By maintaining an uncensored library with proper age - appropriate sections, we can ensure that everyone can access the materials they desire while still protecting the interests of younger patrons.
1796	4773	2	3	The author is writing about the practice of adults removing books that they don't want available. In the end, if this continues, there won't be many books left for people to access. They take out the books that contain bad words or inappropriate pictures. Well, I don't really believe that they should take them out because some of these books can be quite interesting. Well, I'm not a big fan of reading; I don't really like it but I have to read anyway, and I don't think these books should be removed. I don't really think it should be taken out for some reasons. It's better to have them so kids can read and learn about the pictures. Some books aren't that bad for elementary kids. The only books they like are the ones with pictures in them. The high school and middle school kids like the chapter - kind of books and interesting books. The parents would like them to have educational books that will help the kids learn new words and school - related stuff. The books the adults want are the kind that have meaning, like those with a lot of knowledge and school - related content. They want their kids to learn about what they are reading. But yeah, I don't think they should take out the books that they have. They should just leave them for the kids because they are at least educational to them. So the adults would have more educated students to rely on.
1797	4774	2	3	I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and beliefs on certain types of things, whether it's related to religion, culture, and sexuality. Some people can be offended by it, but others might be informed and learn new facts that they didn't already know. People are not going to look at things the same way. Everyone has their own way of life and thinks differently. If one person feels the book was offensive to them, then they might want to take it off the shelves. One by one, people would find other materials offensive, and what does it leave us? No more books, music, movies, and magazines. Let's face it, everyone has different beliefs, values, and purposes. But taking materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridiculous to me. I say if they find it offensive, don't read the book again or the magazine again. If you feel offended over a movie, don't watch it again, and the same goes for music; don't listen to it again. It's as easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines, we wouldn't be as well - informed as we are. America is about being free and having the right to speak our minds. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and keep these materials available for those who can benefit from them.
1798	4775	2	3	Yes, we should keep the books, music, movies, and magazines. The magazines and music might not be suitable for some of us, but most people use music to concentrate on doing work, and magazines help us in getting topics for class work. Why would someone take books or anything that helps us in life? So the person who wants to take books away should leave the books or anything else alone. So, to this, yes, we should keep the books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves. We need to start fighting for what we want and how we want it. It should not be anyone else's choice to decide what is good for us. In the end, these materials are valuable resources that contribute to our learning and enjoyment, and we should safeguard their availability.
1799	4776	2	3	I do believe that books, magazines, music, movies, and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine, they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf. If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie, they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what books, magazines, movies, music, and etc., are for and why they are on the shelves if you can't read, listen, or watch them. Books and magazines should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listened to, and movies should be watched. The reason why I agree with the fact that magazines and books should be taken off the shelf is because they were made to entertain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader's attention. Another reason why I think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new things. An example of learning new things is when you go to school, you pick up the classroom book, and you learn different things like math, you learn about history, or you learn about different things in English class. Magazines and books were made so that different people can take it off a shelf and look through it, even if they only want to look at pictures if it has pictures. The reason why I think music should be taken off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, rock, gospel, or jazz and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf because it was meant to be heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person's life or what goes on in their heads. Music can inspire people in different ways. Music is a part of life, and most people in the world like to listen to different people that inspire them. The reason why I think movies should be taken off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched, not just sit and let the movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different things, such as become an actor. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored. To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books, and music off the shelf, but put them back so that other people can enjoy the things you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies, listening to music, and reading magazines and books can help people in life and also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons, so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good; you won't regret it in the long run. You'll be surprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening, and watching.
1800	4777	2	3	Different Than Everyone Else Why do people find small things offensive? My opinion is that everyone has their own idea of what can be offensive to them. There are so many small things that can be offensive, like books, movies, and music. It's not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf that you might think is offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate someone for their own belongings. Books can be a way to learn new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more than what a person can with their own words. There are so many books that can be a little offensive to people and even kids. I know that a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf about 'drugs', when they are getting their kids educated. Sure, it's not a nice thing to read about, but really, parents should think about it. Don't you think we, like kids, need to know what really means 'drugs'? A book can tell us that, either in a good way or a bad way, but we can learn from it, and you don't even have to talk about it. Movies are similar to books. In one way, you can see in action what they're trying to teach everyone. I know that some movies are horrible, just like 'Schindler's List'. It's a horrible movie to watch, but really, we need to know what really happened to those people. And even if a teacher is telling you, you have to see it with your own eyes to believe it. A good way is to watch the movie and learn from it. Music has a lot of ways of being offensive to people, but singers, that's their way of expressing their own feelings about stuff. We can't really discriminate anyone for their own beliefs. There are so many singers like 'Eminem', who use a lot of bad words in his songs, but that's how he gets his own feelings out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you, it's more of their own opinion, just like we all have different opinions than others. My opinion about feeling offensive is that we all are different and have an opinion about it, and we need to respect that. Especially if I wanted to learn new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me, I would want a book or a movie to learn. And parents, just because I'm reading a book, or watching a movie, or listening to music about bad stuff, don't assume I'm going to do those things. I would just want to learn about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf, especially if I want to read it. Remember, it's your own opinion about the book; not everyone is the same as you. In conclusion, we should embrace our differences in opinions and use these materials as opportunities for learning and growth.
