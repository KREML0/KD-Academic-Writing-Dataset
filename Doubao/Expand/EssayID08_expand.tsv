1	20716	8	3	"A long time ago when I was in third grade, I had a close friend named @PERSON2. His mom was always in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her, I would warmly smile at her, but all she would do was frown and keep walking quickly. At first, I didn't know she was a grouch. I just naively thought she didn't like me or something. When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch, I started to laugh out loud and couldn't stop. He asked me what was so funny. I told him that I thought his mom didn't like me because every time I saw his mom, I would smile at her, and all she would do was frown and walk away briskly. That made my friend laugh too. We were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class for disturbing the quiet. The next day, @PERSON2 and I were having lunch at school. He suddenly said to me, ""<hey your pretty good at making people laugh>"". I replied, ""<no I am not my jokes are really horrible>"". He said, ""<@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school>"". I said @CAPS1. So we went around the whole school, searching everywhere for a new student. Unfortunately, we couldn't find one. Just then, we heard the bell ring and we quickly ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom. It was only @PERSON2 and I, with an empty seat between us. We were really excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 walked to the front of the room and said, ""class today I have an announcement. We have a new student in our class. Say hello to @LOCATION1."" @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door gracefully. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 she could sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down, turned to the both of us, and politely said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that clearly said ""tell her the joke"", and I gave him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said, ""hi I'm @CAPS4. Do you want to hear a joke?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""yeah sure."" I started, ""<@CAPS5 knocks"". She said, ""<who's there"". I said, ""<boo"". She said, ""<boo who?"" I said, ""<oh don't cry I am right here>"". At first, she didn't laugh because she didn't get it. But during the middle of the movie, she said, ""<ohhhh I get it"" and she started to laugh heartily. @PERSON2 turned to me and said, ""<I told you so>"". @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house, I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said, ""<@CAPS1 sounds like a great plan>"". I asked my mom if it was okay if I could spend the night at @PERSON2's house. She said, ""<yeah just make sure it's okay with his mom>"". @PERSON2 asked his mom, and she said it was okay. When I got to @PERSON2's house, the first thing we did was play exciting video games. When it was dinner time, we all sat down at the table to eat. @PERSON2 and I were on one side, and his parents were on the other. When we started eating, @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents. I said @CAPS1. So I said to them, ""<@CAPS5 @CAPS5>"". They replied, ""<who's there"". I said, ""<boo"". They said, ""<boo who?"" I said, ""<oh don't cry I am right here>"". His parents started to laugh and laugh and they kept laughing for like five minutes straight. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled, ""it worked!"" His mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told us that her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner, we went to bed and fell asleep peacefully. The next morning, when my mom came to pick me up, she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was really fun. I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1, but laughter isn't going to help you clean your room. All I could say was, ""gosh darn it."" FIN."

I love the feeling of the dirt that sticks stubbornly to your face, the sweat steadily dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you pour all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS2 heat. Although I love softball, I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates are the things you remember the most throughout your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball, with many laughs, tears, and frustrations. So when I had the opportunity to play on a top - notch team, I eagerly looked forward to all the many more memories I would create. Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was my team name. I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like real sisters to me. They had treated me amazingly throughout my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team. I was going to play with these girls all through high school, and we would become even closer, sharing more inside jokes and bonding moments. As my fifth year now approached, I was looking forward to it. But when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as local, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma. Either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended, enjoying the familiar camaraderie; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better than me and might look down upon me. As I carefully looked at the pros and cons of both teams, I initially decided no. I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point, softball season was just around the corner, and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player? Maybe I could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a good look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team. As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in tight knots. I desperately wanted this team to like me. I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so I didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly, and I wished it would slow down. My heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous that my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd, unpleasant taste to it. Soon after, my mouth became bone dry, no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then stopped. My dad looked at me and just said, ""ready or not here we come"". Nervousness began to take over my body. My arms were shaking uncontrollably, and I was second - guessing every move I made. I even had troubles removing my seat belt. As I approached the field, it felt like time was in slow motion. Walking by, I saw all the girls turn their heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run. That was it. I didn't want to go. I was done. I wanted to go home and start my year with the @CAPS2 team. I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field, they all grew a warm smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, their favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing throughout my whole try - out. There were no awkward moments, and I really enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back. I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with over time. My year with this team was amazing. I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team. If I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2. I have had great memories with the @CAPS2, but also softball is all about going out, discovering new friendships, and therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people."
3	20718	8	3	"Some people like making people laugh, but I absolutely love it. I will do most anything to get a good, hearty laugh. I will make fun of myself in a self - deprecating way, do insanely stupid things that make me look silly, and sometimes even hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little, I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason, I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still, at the tender age of five, I loved making people laugh. And being ""special"", I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you, I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz at that. I was the most hyperactive five - year - old you will ever meet. For example, one time I accidentally hit myself in the head with a hammer while trying to be helpful. Another time, I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, and in my wild movements, I stabbed myself in the head with it and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures. I really wanted to go play outside. My mom, knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her), wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street, I tripped and fell head first onto the corner of the sidewalk, leaving a huge mark on my face and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter, not me being a spaz. Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz, I can get on with the story. Well, I was in kindergarten, and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks. That might sound stupid, but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bullies. Surprisingly, I have never had a bully except in kindergarten, but this was a really bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time, which was the best time to do so because the teacher couldn't see. I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore. He's a goody two - shoes now, which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgie). That day is what this whole story is about. It's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz. Everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other normal day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine like brushing my teeth and getting dressed, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school, I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break, so we ran around the playground and got our little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes, we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story. Right when I would get into the story and lose my guard, I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five - year - old) wedgie. The story was almost finished, and our five - year - old attention spans were wearing thin. We were getting all excited. The story finally finished, and we were standing up. And this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke, and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter. Me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me, I burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain, trying hard to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying, but a little longer to realize they were not laughing at me. To this day, I still get reminded by classmates about that day. Of course, I can laugh about it now, but that was in kindergarten. I'm in ninth grade now, and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person. I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte"
4	20719	8	3	"LAUGHTER""  @CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME1 before. @CAPS1 I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS1 I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH1 have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS1 we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS1 i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME1 i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS1 we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS1 there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS1 we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS1 we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS1-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

6	20722	8	3	"@CAPS3 I'm going to tell @CAPS18 a little story. I vividly remember a time when @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 and I decided to make a snowman at @CAPS11 cozy house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. The snow was freshly fallen, creating a beautiful winter wonderland. I turned to him and said, ""I'm bored. @CAPS1, do @CAPS18 want to do something?"" @PERSON1 quickly replied, ""@CAPS2, go make a snowman."" I whole - heartedly agreed that that would be a fun activity. @CAPS34 started reaching for a warm jacket and gloves, but I stopped him and asked, ""@CAPS1, are @CAPS18 getting those for? @CAPS5's not cold @CAPS20."" ""@CAPS6,"" replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18.""   We started our snowman by building the base, which is the biggest piece for the bottom. After about @NUM1 minutes, the base was almost done, but we began to notice that the cold was seeping through our clothes. ""@CAPS7, we should go inside?"" @PERSON1 suggested. ""@CAPS8, I bet @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate."" So off we went back inside, eagerly hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate.   I saw @CAPS11 mom and politely asked, ""@CAPS10, we have some hot chocolate please?"" ""@CAPS11, @CAPS18 look cold. Of course I'll make @CAPS18 some."" @PERSON1 and I sat downstairs waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate by the heater to get warm.   ""@CAPS5's ready!"" @CAPS11 mom called from upstairs. We quickly flew down the hall and rushed up the stairs. To our amazement, we found not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips as well. ""@CAPS14, mom!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS14, @CAPS16, @CAPS17!"" said @PERSON1. ""@CAPS18're welcome, boys,"" said @CAPS11 mom.   @PERSON1 and I sat down at the table and started drinking our hot chocolate, while @CAPS11 mom put some chips on paper towels for us. I started eating the chips by the handfuls, whereas @PERSON1 grabbed just one. I asked him, ""@CAPS19, did @CAPS18 only grab one, @PERSON1?"" From the corner of his eye, @CAPS34 looked at me and slowly brought the chip to his mouth and took a bite. As he did that, I fell out of @CAPS11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter.   @CAPS11 mom heard the thump of me hitting the floor and ran upstairs to find me laughing. ""@CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?"" she asked. I said to @PERSON1, ""@CAPS22 her."" @PERSON1 then complied and grabbed another chip. While looking at her from the corner of his eye, he slowly brought it to his mouth and took a bite. I started busting up laughing again, yet @CAPS11 mom didn't see the humor. She simply asked, ""@CAPS23, is that @CAPS9 funny?"" @PERSON1 replied, ""I have no idea, but @CAPS34 just about died from laughter."" I started to stop laughing and was able to stand up again. I then told @CAPS11 mom, ""@CAPS5's the way @CAPS34 looks at @CAPS18. @CAPS5 just makes @CAPS18 laugh.""   I then attempted to do the same thing, but with no effect on @PERSON1. ""@CAPS19, isn't @CAPS5 working?"" I asked. ""@CAPS26, I'm awesome like that. @CAPS3, @CAPS18're @NUM2,"" he said. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS28, I'm gonna keep at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right."" So I tried to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I managed to do was spill @CAPS11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. ""@CAPS18 want me to @CAPS22 @CAPS18?"" @PERSON1 offered. ""@CAPS31!!!! Please!"" I begged. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18."" @CAPS34 then proceeded to grab another chip and while looking at me from the corner of his eye, he bit the chip. I started laughing uncontrollably and without pause. After about @NUM1 minutes, I stopped laughing.   ""I'll get that right!"" I declared. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS35 @CAPS5."" I grabbed a chip, looked straight at him, and bit down, but nothing happened. I tried again, this time while looking at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye, but still nothing. I thought to myself, ""@CAPS36, if I @CAPS33't get @CAPS5 this time, I'm giving up."" ""@CAPS6, here goes."" I grabbed a chip and slowly brought it to @CAPS11 mouth while squinting at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye. I bit the chip, and to my delight, I noticed @CAPS34 was laughing. @CAPS34's laughing!!! ""I told @CAPS18 I'd get @CAPS5!"" "" @CAPS31, @CAPS31, @CAPS18 did."" This is one of the many times laughter brought @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 and me together."
7	20723	8	3	"My best friend, @PERSON1 and I have been close ever since we were @NUM1 years old. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lessons at our local, friendly dance studio. The studio had a warm and inviting atmosphere, filled with the sounds of music and laughter. We've stayed close throughout the years because we've always engaged in similar activities, like going to movies and trying out new cafes.   We're very different from each other though. I'm more outgoing, always eager to speak my mind and carefree in my approach to life. @CAPS4, on the other hand, is very conservative and can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out, like two sides of a well - balanced coin.   Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION1 and I had been excitedly planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some quality time to ourselves, away from the stress of exams. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. ""@CAPS3?"" @CAPS4 answered cheerfully. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time did @CAPS16 wanna hang out?"" I asked. ""I was thinking @NUM2?"" ""@CAPS6, good!"" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I carefully grabbed my toothbrush, a soft pillow, comfortable pajamas, and a warm blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door.   My dad dropped me off with all of my gear. I had brought my cozy pajamas, my fluffy pillow, and an extra soft blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked gently, and waited patiently. Only seconds later did @CAPS4 answer it with a big, beaming smile across her face. @CAPS4 led me down to her basement where @CAPS4 had all the junk food set out, neatly arranged and ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier that day and had carefully bought everything we loved. @CAPS4 had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were all kinds of chips, delicious cookies, fizzy sodas, colorful candy, rich chocolate, and a mouth - watering pizza.   I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we couldn't eat all the food. We simply weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we were stuffed and laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS7.   Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. ""I did soo good on all of mine! I'm gonna get ALL A's"" @PERSON1 bragged proudly. @CAPS4 has gotten straight A's every year since middle school. ""I think I did pretty @CAPS8 too, not so sure about a @NUM3 though."" I said as I was laying upside down on the floor, my hair falling towards the ground. ""@CAPS8, we'll just see tomorrow!""   We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS7 comfortably. It was already @NUM4 in the @TIME1 and we were still on a sugar high, full of energy and excitement. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, which made us jump and scream, and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week, where we sang along to the catchy tunes.   That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM2 in the @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn't keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast, dreaming of more fun times together.   When I woke - up the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 wasn't laying across from me anymore. @CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM4:30 in the afternoon. I looked back at @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. ""@CAPS5..."" I grunted, while I was stretching my tired body. ""@TIME1."" @CAPS4 said abruptly. @CAPS4 was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. ""@CAPS12's up?"" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS4 had received all A's... and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 had gotten a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her, kinda amused by how upset @CAPS4 was.   ""@CAPS16 got a @CAPS13... and @CAPS16're crying?"" I asked. @CAPS4 looked up at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face, and @CAPS4 busted out laughing. @CAPS4 felt so stupid for crying over @NUM8 @CAPS13. I started laughing too. I knew my grades would be far worse. Heck, I'd be glad to get @CAPS13's. @PERSON1 and I are the perfect best friends. We even each other out. I tell her to lighten up, and @CAPS4 tells me to focus more. @CAPS16 can't take little things like that too seriously, it's just not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS16 just gotta relax, and maintain your focus. @CAPS16 have to find your perfect balance of work and play."
8	20724	8	3	Laughter is truly one of life's most precious gifts. It is a really good thing to have in any relationship you are in, whether it's a friendship, a love relationship, or a work relationship. In every type of relationship, laughter acts as a lubricant, making the interactions smoother and more enjoyable. Either way, you need laughter so you don't get so uptight that you become no fun to be around.   Every now and then, somebody around you in your life needs some laughter to cheer them up. People should laugh every day because it has the remarkable ability to make you feel happy even when you are in a really bad mood. When you are feeling suicidal, all you really want is someone to talk to you and make you smile, laugh, and giggle. It really feels good when you laugh with a friend or a significant other. You like to see people smile and laugh, and your friends and family also like to see you laugh here and there once in a while.   So every now and then, take a moment to laugh for once and be happy, even if it is for just a few seconds in your life. Laughter is a major thing to have in your life. It's incredibly nice to laugh and giggle even when life gets you down and is just plain crappy.   Anyone and everyone needs to laugh so they don't become so grouchy and unbearable to be around. So please, for everyone's sake around you and in your life, please laugh. Come on, you know you want to laugh. Ha ha ha. I hope that at least made you smile a little bit.   In any relationship you have or are in, laughter is a major thing you need. Always try to laugh here and there, and you will do just fine in life no matter
9	20725	8	3	I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness.
10	20726	8	3	"Laughter, one of life's greatest gifts. Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried? What about laughed so hard you can't breath, or noise no longer escapes from your lips? I am the type of person that can @CAPS6 at something so stupid that when I get done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can @CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes out at all! @CAPS1's amazing what laughter can do to a persons heart. The way @CAPS1 makes you feel, the way @CAPS1 makes you act. @CAPS1's so contagious, and @CAPS1 happens all around us everyday. You are never too old for laughter, @CAPS1 happens to the best of us. young or old, @CAPS1 doesn't matter. Laughter has no age limit. One time @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I stayed up until three in the @TIME1. We were so delirious, and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can @CAPS6 at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around @CAPS2 house, and @CAPS1 felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of @CAPS2 eyes, and i couldn't get a breath out of @CAPS2 heaving lungs. When @CAPS1 gets to the silent laughing, @CAPS1's even more funny because that person can't control @CAPS1, and they look so hilarious because there rocking back and forth, with this silly expression upon their face, not making any noise at all. Have you ever just laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after that ""lifetime"" of laughter? @CAPS1 almost feels as something as powerful as the sun just warms over your heart and soul. When I @CAPS6 I feel all the happiness and emotion just flow all throughout @CAPS2 entire body. @CAPS1's one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a greater feeling than the warmth that laughter brings. @CAPS1's so great when you and a @CAPS3, or group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when your feeling down, maybe need some cheering up. You can always depend on a @CAPS6 to pull you through. No matter what mood I'm in, @CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, @CAPS1 is so hard to not join in. Laughing is so contagious! @CAPS1 effects us in our everyday life's. I bet you that, you cannot go one day without hearing someone @CAPS6, or you not laughing yourself. I probably @CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, @CAPS5 not more. I love hearing people @CAPS6, @CAPS1 brightens @CAPS2 mood and also @CAPS2 day. I would most definitely say laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughter. Boring, right? @CAPS2 advice, @CAPS6 like you heard the funniest thing in the world. @CAPS6 like there is no tomorrow. Who cares @CAPS5 people thinks its dumb. You'll feel much better after you have that tear-induced, hard to breath, silent but oh-so therapeutic @CAPS6. Laughter really is the shortest distance between people!"
11	20727	8	3	"Laughter is a natural way to express delight, fun, or to respond to the object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, and it brings a large benefit to our life as it occurs in our daily schedule. Without laughter, we couldn't express our happy and outgoing side. We would have no particular feeling of joy in life, except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cause more wrinkles because it uses many more facial muscles. For me, laughter is an all - day thing. The @CAPS1 show, my friends, family, and horses are my number one reason for turning my frown upside down. You might think horses can't smile or talk, but they do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. They are all smart, but they can be clumsy or goofy at times. Mostly, they all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters. There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE1 mid - day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend, and we both had our two horses saddled, fully ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pounding at the shore with the salty smell filling our noses. Once we hit the sand, we were running side by side with the wind whistling past our ears like a fast - moving train. The horses' heads were equally pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced around like young yearlings again. They would walk deep into the water until it was drenching us both. Then, as soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'd swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore. After about five hours of adventuring in caves, exploring sand dunes, and looking at starfish, we were all worn out and then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we ate dinner while watching the sun go down to finish the perfect day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door, I gave my horse a good pat on his neck. As I was about to walk out, my horse turned his head and then gave me a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home, I knew this was a perfect day because of the laughter and all the times I just laughed for the enjoyment. Also, my face did hurt a little from smiling so much. Laughter truly makes life more beautiful."
12	20728	8	3	"Starting a story out with two @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys named @ORGANIZATION1 can already be considered a comedy. Those are the names of my identical twin cousins. I can honestly admit that they are @NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth. From the way he named his children, it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hard - working man. Occasionally, my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be quite a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful step - siblings who hate me, my brother, my sister, and even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys running around livens it up a little and makes us all laugh together as a family. It must have been @DATE1 in @DATE2 when @CAPS7 was home and we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels. She appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My step - dad @PERSON1 needed to go to @PERSON2's for nails, child locks, and I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes. We loaded up the car, and I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the back seat playing with the ponies and laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" and the @ORGANIZATION2's until we arrived in the @PERSON2's parking lot. One of the twins finds it pretty hilarious to run down the isles and hide behind items on the lower shelves, while the other enjoys pretending he's @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, getting @CAPS7 confused. Eventually, the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in @LOCATION1 and me catching them and holding them as captives in the seat - belts of the @PERSON2's cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks and found them down isle @NUM4. There was a large man standing in front of our destination. When I say large, I don't mean muscular or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many @CAPS1 shows he watches daily and maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long and sandy blond. He wore a dark purple @CAPS2 die shirt and slip - on sandals. One of the twins apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, ""@CAPS3 cow @ORGANIZATION1 look at that lady! She's so huge!"" and then laughed outrageously and the other twin agreed. ""@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked a bit and tried to get them to be quiet. However, the twins paid no attention to me. They were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder next to me giggling and laughing along with them. They were quiet for a moment, then gasped and exclaimed, "" @CAPS5 she's as big as a fire truck!"" The man turned around and glared at me. I apologized at least @NUM5 times and started to take the boys out of the isle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move. I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear and shouted frantically, ""@CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up and she's going to squish you on the floor!"" Everyone laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but I was so embarrassed that I just took them to the car and waited for @PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word I said. @PERSON1 only took approximately @NUM6 more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, and a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store and I chuckled quietly until @PERSON1 hopped into the truck, then I started laughing profusely. When I returned home, I told my mom what had happened. She laughed for a while, and I laughed even harder and quite a bit longer than I had before. I went to sleep with a fairly massive headache that night, but I think it was worth it for all the laughter and the fun we had."
13	20732	8	3	"When I meet new people, it's like ""alright"" because everyone needs friends. As people say, friends come and go, but true friends wouldn't leave. I remember I met this beautiful girl named @PERSON1. To me, she was not just a friend. I knew I wanted to have a life with her and be with her. People say love can't come true, but turn that upside down because it's the other way around. Love doesn't fade; it comes from up above. I remember when I first talked to her, it was like God was there telling me that she is the one for me. I knew I could save her from getting hurt by love. When I first looked into her eyes, it was like I could feel the way her heart was feeling. It was falling apart. So I told her, ""Your heart wouldn't be broken in half because I'll replace it with mine."" I told her, ""You're the one that I want, the one that I need, the one that I gotta have to succeed. I wanna know you like no one else can know you. Your name is forever like a tattoo in my heart. You're the apple to my tree that will never be cut down. I wanna stand with you on a mountain and show you that I'm different than other guys. I'm faithful like no one else can be. You're amazing just the way you are. I wouldn't change nothing about you because I love everything about you. I love your eyes, I love your smile, I love your personality."" So I told her, ""Take a chance on me. I know you've been through so much, but don't let that come between us."" So she said yes. She was so happy. It was like her dream came true for her, a guy that can show her that they're not like the others, a guy that's always faithful, honest, and truly loving and that will never lie or cheat. So I told her she's my super - human. She was so happy that I came into her life. She said I changed her whole life, and she changed mine too. My heart belongs to you and no one else because if you're not the one that has my heart, then my heart will just be a toy and break. I told her she will never be so cold. I will always warm up her day and night with my arms and my body temperature. I told her all my wishes came true. You're the one for me. I'm finally not lonely now that I got you. So I told her it's like she's finally my wifey. I told her every girl I dated played with my heart. They were not being true to me. I was not living my life the way I wanted it to be. So one day I told myself, ""Is that girl even in this planet, the one that's always honest, faithful, truly loving, trustworthy, and that will never lie or cheat?"" So I told myself I'll keep looking for that special girl, and now I can say I found her because that girl's name is @PERSON1. I told her she will never be sad anymore or have a million tears running down her precious little face. I told her I will always be one phone call away, not two but one. She was so happy when I said that she is my paradise, my whole wide world. She finally made my dreams come true. I just want it to be me and you, no one else. Trust me, I'll trust you. Our love will never die. It will never fall. Our love will always be alive. Our love will stand high until it hits the sky. Our love is a beautiful journey that will continue to bring us joy and fulfillment."
14	20733	8	3	"People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion, I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. It makes you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend, or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person's face. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing and having fun? I have, and sometimes I feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"". She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing every time she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shared shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away every time she had the chance to hang out with him. Every time she could think about him, she would smile and laugh. That's how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was. Sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy every time she talks about him, but I still don't know if laughter is what kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother every time she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how to put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes and make her laugh. A question she asked me once: ""@CAPS2, do you think of two couples when you see them laughing and having a good time?"" The first thing that pops into your head is that they know how to have fun and don't let anything get in their way of laughing and having a good time. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter because if you don't know how to make the other person laugh, you don't know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other, it never lasts too long because my grandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh, then maybe they wouldn't be together still. I understand now why my grandmother fell in love with my grandpa because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship, you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person's face because if you don't, pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right. Laughter does play a big"
15	20734	8	3	"Laughter is the best medicine."" The phrase almost everyone has heard before. But it'@CAPS20 true! I've had days when all I could think about was how @CAPS23 life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that'@CAPS20 when one of @CAPS14 best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS19 @CAPS14 pants and @CAPS14 eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, @CAPS14 sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and @CAPS21 laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.    There was this particular time when @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to @CAPS1'@CAPS20 house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends @CAPS9 @CAPS21 @CAPS13 so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and @CAPS21 as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.    Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me that we could get some cereal. @CAPS21 regular milk and cereal, right? There'@CAPS20 nothing @CAPS22 special about @CAPS4'n @CAPS5 (besides that it'@CAPS20 freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I @CAPS6, @CAPS6, @CAPS6, milk, so that had to mean something. ""@CAPS7 this milk is so good! @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8!"" @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. ""@CAPS9 you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!"" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing @CAPS14 mind. ""@CAPS10, I don'@CAPS17 know. Two percent?""@CAPS1 looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it @CAPS21 happened.    @TIME1, it happened. @CAPS1 peed her pants, and not @CAPS21 a little. It wasn'@CAPS17 @CAPS21 the idle threat rushed out, the ""@CAPS12'mgoingtopee!"" squeal. @CAPS13 no. She actually peed herself, and I still @CAPS16'@CAPS17 even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, ""@CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8 I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS18 @CAPS19! THERE'@CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24!!"" I whipped around and saw @CAPS1, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking @CAPS26 @CAPS27 of @LOCATION1 all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing @CAPS14 shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where @DATE1 was. @CAPS1, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what @CAPS21 happened. So naturally, @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn'@CAPS17 have?   The fact that we @CAPS16 always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love @CAPS14 friends . It'@CAPS20 great when you have people that you @CAPS16 laugh about everything and nothing with. @CAPS1 is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS20 pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them. Personally, I love laughing, especially with (and mostly at) @CAPS14 best friends.    "
16	20735	8	3	One time when I was skateboarding with my friend, I got really mad because I kept falling off my skateboard and couldn't perform a certain trick. I felt so frustrated that I wanted to stop skating right then and there. His mom, who was watching us from the sidelines, noticed my distress and tried to convince me to keep skateboarding. She laughed and said I will never be good enough to skate, but then she quickly added that I have improved more than some of the people that she knows. That kind and encouraging words made me feel better than before, and then I started skateboarding every day from then on. When I think about that day, I still laugh at how quickly my mood changed. Skating can be fun in many ways. People can skate for fun and for competition. There are different ways of skating, and people have their own unique ways of doing it. There are many different kinds of skateboards, and the people who ride them handle them differently. Some of the people that ride skateboards, I laugh at because of the funny way they skate. Skating has become a big part of my life, and that day was a turning - point for me.
17	20736	8	3	"Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life. But as I've grown and really started thinking for myself, I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure, trust is important, but it isn't the only key factor. I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping it full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that kind of relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and a wonderful way of understanding with each other. Other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, so I am very fortunate. Sure, we have hard times just like any family, but we are able to laugh those tough moments off with time and start anew. My mom helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Having a great bond with my mom is so important to me, but we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen, I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions. I just wanted to stay quiet. Then, seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried she would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever she would joke around with me, I would take those jokes all too seriously, and whenever we would fight about small things, I thought she would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner, my mom had informed me that it was my night to do dishes. Unlike usual, I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. She said, ""@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. She followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON1? Are you alright, it's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" she exclaimed. Again, not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything. The only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes, she pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face; she looked worried. She explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that she so desperately wanted to have with me. She told me about how they would laugh together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then laugh. ""Laugh? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned. She replied, ""Because laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" She helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the first time in my life, I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep, I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old, I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can laugh off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter has indeed become the glue that holds our relationship together."
18	20737	8	3	"Laughter. A story about laughter is what you want to hear? Well, my life is filled with laughter and smiling. Crazy I know! If it wasn't for laughing, I would not have the six - pack that I have today. Have you ever stopped to think about when one person can make another person laugh, they usually become really close friends, maybe even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This one time, my boyfriend and I were laughing so hard that our stomachs started to ache. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much every day with him. He is so amazing. Me and him, well, we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, and a lot can happen in one year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even move away from those relationships you just made. Me and @PERSON1, we are always laughing, at each other and at other things as well. We always have fun times with each other. It was a late Friday night and he was walking me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass, and we were walking right next to it. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, he acts like he is getting pulled into the grass. So guess what I did? I screamed as loud as I could possibly scream! Then he starts calling my name in a creepy voice, telling me to come over to the grass. Out of curiosity of what just happened, I start walking over towards the tall grass. When I arrived to the spot where he entered the grass, he tells me ""Oh no, I lost my shoe and I can't seem to find it anywhere!"" @PERSON1 and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was really dark, so we used our hands to search around for his shoe. ""I found it!"" I said. After we found the shoe, we realized two hours went by. We were so tired that we laid down in the grass to take a break, and we both started cracking up with laughter because of how ridiculous it was that we spent two hours on something that was supposed to be a little joke! It was so awesome. When we finally got to our feet, our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore. I have never laughed harder than that in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time ever. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends, you would probably find it hard to laugh. With friends, you always have someone to laugh at and also laugh with. This is why I cherish my best friend @PERSON1 and all the happy and laughing times we have together, because you'll never know when the last time you'll see that person will be. Laughter with friends is truly a precious part of life."
19	20739	8	3	Laughter is a big part in my relationship. I feel so much more connected with a person if we laugh together. Laughing makes you feel great. You could be in a depression stage, and either a friend or a family member could walk up to you, pacify you, and make you laugh. If I had a relationship that had no laughter in it, I would leave that person as fast as I could. Some people think relationships are only about money and/or looks. People nowadays don't last that long in a relationship. Back in the old days, people would die together, and even in death, they would have their graves right by each other. My boyfriend's name is @PERSON1. We have been going out for four years now. He is a very funny guy. I love his jokes. Sometimes he doesn't even try to make a joke, but he ends up making one anyway. When we were first going out, I was throwing a birthday party, and me, @PERSON1, and one of his friends went in the woods and hid from everyone else. When the others came to find us, we jumped out and scared them. They were mad at us at first, but when nightfall came, we were all laughing about it together. My mom and dad don't really laugh together that much. They just go to work with each other and come home together. My dad loves to crack jokes now and then, but my mom is the kind of person who likes to laugh at the other people that get hurt. My grandma is so funny. She tries to make people laugh and sometimes they end up hurting themselves so she can get a kick out of it. All of my friends are funny. My best friend @LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I have ever known. She likes to dance funny and mock people that she doesn't like. When she works, she'll try to find something to make a joke out of, so she could bring it to me and almost make me pee my pants. @LOCATION1's relationship was very bad. She loves to laugh, but her boyfriend hates making jokes. She tried to stick it out, but things got worse and worse. The only thing he would do is sit on his bed or his couch and play video games, or watch wrestling. He would make @LOCATION1 clean his room and do the dishes. He has a one - year - old sister, and he makes her watch her, clean her, and feed her while he was up in his room playing video games. @LOCATION1 got so tired of it, so she packed her stuff and she left. She went to her sister's house. Now she has a funny boyfriend, and they always laugh together. There can be a laughing relationship with animals as well as humans. Animals are the one thing that can't talk back or make fun of you. Animals are just like humans, but they can't talk and they have fur. My cat is the king of my house. His name is @CAPS1. He loves to follow me all over my house. I love to sit on the floor and watch him wrestle with all of the other cats. Every time I go into the kitchen, he is always there with me, begging for food. After he eats, he gets a burst of energy and runs all over the house. It makes me laugh. He will stop right in front of me and just stare at me. If I move, then he will run away. Cats are cute, but not all of them have the power to look into your soul like my cat. @CAPS1 has big eyes, and his meow is so sweet and incessant. The funniest thing about him is how fat he is. He is a fat cat, but he is only one year old. So when I see him running all over the place, it makes me laugh. My horse is the same way. His name is @CAPS2, and he is four years old. He is a crazy horse, but at the same time, he is very funny. He tries to play with my other horses and sometimes gets hurt because he bites them, so they kick him back. He has a blue eye, so I bought him for my purposes. Some people think horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family. Laughter can truly enrich all kinds of relationships, whether with humans or animals.
20	20741	8	3	Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look, there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life, I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day because I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. Little @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion, she is. Since she is so young, she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case, she is full of joy and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her, all that takes place is laughter and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and whenever you put the shapes into the right slots, it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh - fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently, we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2's brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder than ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see, laughter is happy and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew are just one example. What makes you laugh and smile? Laughter from these precious family moments
21	20742	8	3	"Why is it that laughter can bring people so close together? Is it because laughing shows trust for one another, or is it simply because you understand each other? There are many different kinds of laughter, like cracking a hilarious joke, or when someone does something extremely embarrassing. The story that I will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever.   It all started on that fateful morning when I woke up, and I had forgotten to transfer my wet clothes from the washer machine to the dryer. Now I had to rummage through all my clothes up in my room and find clean camouflage clothes that weren't dirty, or at least something that I could wear. By this time, anybody would be in a bad mood, and I was trying to rush to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go, but I wasn't. I was in a hurry, and when you rush, you are bound to forget something, and I had left my gun at the house. Five miles down the road, I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to go get it. Not only were we now late, but we were speeding to the cabin for breakfast. @PERSON1 had the eggs so that we could make omelets. As we were racing down the road, we hit a bump, and everything, I mean everything, hit the ceiling in the truck and then slammed to the floor. In doing this, all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast.   It's about thirty minutes till shooting hours, and we are late showing up to the blind so that @PERSON1 and I can meet up with our other friends, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally, we get to the blind right before sunrise, and while we are getting all set up, a group of twenty mallards drop in unexpectedly and take off before we could get a shot off. Now we're all thinking, great, there goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible morning. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day.   At around twelve o'clock, we gave up and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up, we got stuck in two inches of water in the truck. I remember thinking to myself, ""Oh no, this is not really happening to us right now"". So @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I got out of the truck to push, and @PERSON1 stayed in the truck to drive. There were many attempts to push the truck out, and finally, on the sixth try, we pushed the truck hard enough to get it out of the muddy water. Now the funny part, when we had freed the truck, @PERSON1 laid on the gas, causing the truck tires to spin and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere, I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a shield from the mud. By this point, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 are covered in an inch-thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh; it was the funniest thing ever. @PERSON1 had watched it all through his rearview mirror, and as soon as he was safe from getting the truck stuck again, he fell out of the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were laughing a bit too.   So when it's a day when nothing goes your way or you're having bad luck, you never know what the day has in store for you. In this case, it was one of the most memorable things I remember that happened that duck season. It just goes to show that even in the midst of a bad day, a little laughter can turn things around and create memories that will last a lifetime."
22	20743	8	3	"@CAPS1 figure something out to do! I am really freaking bored!"" @CAPS2 explained as all of us relaxed next to his dark blue @CAPS3, which was gracefully parked right outside of my house. The group of us was young, and as young boys, we needed something to do. Gears started to turn in my head as I thought of a bulletproof plan that would be very funny.   ""@CAPS4 I've got it!"" I yelped. ""@CAPS1 here it is, I'm really down for anything right @CAPS21,"" @CAPS6 quickly replied. ""@CAPS7 since @CAPS2 has a car, he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran wrap. Then he can come back to the four-way intersection right outside of my neighborhood and tie the wrap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so cars will speed through it!"" I quickly explained as I ran out of breath. Bursts of loud laughter came from all directions where my friends were standing as I came to the realization that this idea was golden. ""I will drive and go get it, but does anyone have some money to pitch in!"" @CAPS2 pounced as @LOCATION2, @CAPS6, and I handed single bills to him.   ""That's plenty! Give me a few minutes, then we can meet at the intersection right outside of @CAPS10's neighborhood."" @CAPS2 said as he brushed everyone off his car and began to drive out of my neighborhood. ""@CAPS12 text me when you're about to get back!"" I screamed to @CAPS2 as the sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the evening sky. Minutes flew by, and the rest of us just sat down on the curb, talked, and waited for @CAPS2. Ring ting, my custom ringtone for incoming texts sounded. My eyes quickly scanned the phone's contents and concluded that @CAPS2 was ready with the saran wrap at the four-way intersection.   ""@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready, and so @CAPS1, let's do this thing,"" I muttered as I grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 trailed behind, as @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the back. I yelled once again to encourage everyone. @CAPS2's car lights lit up the night air as he made a blinking signal to show where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the driveway of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood where @CAPS2 was parked. ""@CAPS17 you've waited long enough,"" @CAPS2 explained. ""Well, we are all here! So @CAPS1, go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON1 explained as he started to lead us toward the intersection, which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection, there were no cars! We all seized this opportunity, and I yelled, ""@NUM1 and @PERSON1, look out for cars!"" as @CAPS2 and I began the process. Quickly, I opened the saran wrap and ran across the road, uncoiling the wrap as I went. Soon as @CAPS2 and I were both on opposite sides of the street, we both started to firmly wrap the saran around the trees we had already picked out. Once I pulled and inspected it, finding that it was perfect, I sprinted to a short fence that was a border for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. I was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. ""Haha, this is perfect! I made sure everything feels right!"" I explained as we all gazed upon the delicately hung wrap that ran from both sides of the two-way street. ""@CAPS21 we must wait,"" @PERSON2 said as anticipation fell over us. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM2 pm, most of the good folk of @LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly, a car came out of nowhere, speeding and only @NUM3 yards from the great prank. ""@CAPS22,"" I yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car sped through the saran wrap and then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as we inspected the target, which was completely in disarray. But the angry male driver, hearing our laughing, decided to leave his car and chase us! ""@CAPS23 up,"" I screamed! We all ran right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS6! The angry man caught him as the rest of us all high-tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house, we all began to ask ourselves what happened to @CAPS6! Suddenly, out of nowhere, @CAPS6 came running. As he finally reached us, we started to burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda! @CAPS6 would never tell us what happened that night, although we could have guessed! As the exciting and long night wrapped up, we all called it quits and went to sleep at my house. But laughter wasn't in short supply that night as we all fell asleep, knowing we had created a memorable and hilarious experience."
23	20745	8	3	"Interesting flight. It was the @DATE1 of this @DATE2. After a long day filled with some crying, lots of goodbyes, I was finally in the airport, waiting for my plane to @LOCATION1. I've been in that airport so many times... I love @LOCATION2, but it's always exciting to go on vacation. I usually go with my parents quite frequently. Today it was different; this wasn't a vacation. It was going to be a whole year. And my parents weren't going to be there. Just thinking about being away from them and all my friends in @LOCATION2 for such a long time made my stomach churn. Especially because in a few hours, I was going to be meeting my host parents that I had never seen before, and I was wondering if they were going to be normal people or a pair of complete weirdos.  Once in the plane, I sat next to a young girl who was in @LOCATION2 studying architecture and going back home for winter, while I was just going away from it. She asked, ""@CAPS1, do you speak English?"" and I said, ""I try to."" She laughed. She looked nice, with a big smile, and she was pretty too. We started talking, and she could feel how nervous and anxious I was. She asked me if I was okay, and I told her that I was going to be a foreign exchange student for the next year and shared my concerns about it, like meeting people or missing home. She told me, ""You will be fine. Don't worry about it. I wish I had that chance when I was your age."" Then she changed the subject.  After a long conversation, she started reading a magazine, and I put on my music. When we were about to reach @LOCATION1, she all of a sudden screamed so hard that it made me jump. We laughed for a long time, and she couldn't even talk to me or explain why she screamed because everybody was looking at us, and that made it even more funny and kind of embarrassing too, so she couldn't stop laughing. Then she told me that the guy in the picture of her magazine went to high school with her a few years ago, and they were together for some time, but since graduation, they didn't know anything about each other. He was now working at a bank and making good money, really good money... She was going crazy talking to herself and asking why in the world she stopped talking with him.  That good time with her, even if I haven't seen her again, made me really happy. And by the time we got off the plane, I was more confident and almost forgot about all the nervousness that I felt before. After @NUM2 months here, everything is going perfectly. I'm sure that even if it was just a few laughs and not a really long time on that plane, when I go back to @LOCATION2 and think about this experience, I will think about her. I'll count that moment as my first good memory of this new adventure. It just goes to show that a little connection and laughter can make a big difference when stepping into the unknown."
24	20746	8	3	"In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger, and complications. Although there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve much laughter, and it was rather boring and sad. I would spend tremendous hours of my time just to get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gentle soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh even though he was happy. I would ask many times over and over, ""Are you sure you're happy because you don't seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing. All I see is a frown."" I told him with a sour face, and he replied back, ""Yes, @CAPS1, I am happy, but just because I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not. And besides, with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" With that reply, I simply just shrugged and began again. ""Then why can't you laugh?"" and he replied back in a drowsy voice because he was getting tired of the same topic every day. ""It's not that I can't laugh; it's that I choose not to."" And I said, ""Well, why on earth would you do that?"" He sighed and huffed, really getting tired of the topic. ""All right, if you don't stop this,"" he said in a gentle but strained voice, ""I'm going to have to stop being so nice to you, and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year."" But of course, he was only joking. He could never"
25	20747	8	3	"These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody."
26	20748	8	3	"Friends aren't always what we want them to be. They aren't always easy to find, but with a simple smile and a hearty laugh, a friendship can blossom. I mean, what is a friendship if there aren't those moments where you laugh until you pee? Moments when you laugh until you can't catch your breath, and you feel like you've just done one hundred sit - ups. Of course, you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this, and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didn't expect a new friendship, but in a new town and surrounded by new people, I met the friend I now call my best - friend. It was the year of @NUM1, and I was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom, everyone stared at me as if I was some kind of criminal, and they whispered behind my back whenever I passed by their desks. Well, at least that's how it felt to me. My homeroom teacher, @PERSON2, handed me my so - called schedule. Sixth period was @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2? What on earth is that? I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until I walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the gym door where my class was supposed to be. I stepped in, and there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one - wheeled bike. Wow! I let out a laugh, thinking how could I not know that. I looked around and saw that I was the only sixth - grader there. I took a seat and scanned the room, trying to confirm if I was truly the only sixth - grader present. Just then, a girl who looked about my age walked in. She took a seat, and I wondered if she was nice so I could go talk to her, but I was too embarrassed. @PERSON1 asked everyone to form groups of two, and I mustered up the courage to ask the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started using the unicycles, and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could manage on our own. When the class ended, I told her my name was @PERSON3, and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because I now actually had a ""friend,"" well, at least someone I'd talked to. The next time I went to class, she was absent, so I was all alone that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named Savannah, who was a total girly - girl. She didn't want to ride the @CAPS2 at all; all she wanted to do was talk. I was fed up with her by the end of the day, and I hadn't practiced my unicycle riding. I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and thankfully, she did. This time, we had to team up with our partner and create a routine to a song of our choice, so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and brainstorming when suddenly, we both tumbled. We stared at each other and just started laughing uncontrollably. I couldn't breathe, and she almost peed. It was one of the best times I'd experienced that year, and I felt like me and her could become the best of friends. We are now really close friends, and just that one moment of shared laughter brought us close at heart. We love to laugh; we believe that the more you laugh, the younger you look, and well, I think it's true. Everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship, what brings it together is a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laugh so hard you fart and milk comes out of your friend's nose. It's a great time, and you never forget it. It's something so simple yet so special, and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It transformed my acquaintance with a person I'd barely met into an inseparable and amazing friendship."
27	20751	8	3	"It was a normal, bright, and warm @DATE1 day as I was about to enter my fifth - grade year. My older sister and I had spent the whole day playing with our other neighbors who were around our age. One of those neighbors was a boy. We were at a loss for what to do. It was swelteringly hot outside, so going for a walk in the sun was out of the question. We decided it would be fun to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made. He crafted it out of an old swing - set seat, and I thought our neighbor would really enjoy it. We all made our way into our garage to get it. My sister offered to retrieve it for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I declined. It was my idea to show it to our neighbor, so I wanted to be the one to get it. As I focused intently, stretching and reaching to grab the slingshot, I noticed everyone around me snickering. My concentration started to waver as I wondered what they were all laughing at. I stood there, bewildered, for a moment before I discovered what had happened. My sister had pulled down my pants... right in front of our boy neighbor. I quickly picked my pants up off the ground, glared straight at my sister, and started weakly pounding her with my flimsy fists. I fled to my room, sobbing all the way. A few moments later, my sister came into my room. She tried to coax me out from under the covers with the last two fruit roll - ups. She sat on my bed, waiting patiently for half an hour, but I refused to budge. She didn't say a word, but I could feel her intense gaze through the sheets. Later that night, I finally emerged. My sister kept apologizing, but it didn't matter to me because I was still furious with her. The entire next day passed, and nothing had changed. She continued to apologize, and I remained in the ignoring mode. My @CAPS1 approached me and told me that my sister was terribly sorry and also upset because I wasn't talking to her. I thought to myself, ""How could she be upset...?"" but I realized that I hadn't treated her right, even though I was unhappy with her. After hearing what my @CAPS1 had said, I decided that it wasn't worth holding a grudge. I went to talk to my sister for the first time in days. She explained that she hadn't meant to hurt my feelings; she was just joking around. After discussing it for a while, I concluded that I'd gotten so upset because she'd done it in front of our friend. We often play around like that, but it's always just among family. I was worried that it might have scared our neighbor away, but he came back to play a few days later, so I had no reason to be mad. Even though I'd been embarrassed, I admitted that it was actually quite funny. We had a good laugh about it, and we were no longer at odds. I learned that dwelling on the past gets you nowhere, and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time the incident is brought up, we laugh so hard that tears stream down our faces. I wouldn't have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It's another memory that my sister and I share and can look back on fondly. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to someone."
28	20754	8	3	"Making someone laugh is truly the best feeling for their soul, and it's one step closer to achieving internal happiness. Whether you're having the worst day of your life or the best day of your life, laughter can always turn things around. I vividly remember sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, completely bored out of my mind. Then, out of the blue, a shy, quiet kid started laughing! He just couldn't stop! It was as if he was under the influence of ""laughing gas."" He laughed so hard that he gasped for breath. His contagious laughter made me chuckle, and then my best friend sitting next to me joined in. Soon enough, the entire class was roaring with laughter! So, even though some of the students in @CAPS2 class might have been bored or having a bad day, the laughter spread like wildfire throughout the room, making it a much better day. Laughter is highly infectious, and it has the power to make everyone happier. And when you're happier, you're also healthier. Therefore, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it to thrive. When you ask someone what they like about their boyfriend or girlfriend in a @CAPS2 relationship, they'll almost always say, ""He/she makes me laugh."" On the contrary, when there's no laughter in a relationship, it often leads to more arguments, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh, the better your life becomes, and the more you can enjoy it. Have you laughed today?"
29	20755	8	3	There are numerous joys in life. Some are more significant than others, and some are so obvious that it would be foolish not to notice them. Have you ever sat on your porch or stared out of the window, watching the sun rise while reflecting on your life and its unique aspects? As you sit there, you think about all the wonderful memories, all the shared laughter, all the sorrows, all the pain, and all the love and hate. It's no surprise that almost everyone has done this at some point and wondered if they could change things, how they would do it, or if they would leave their life as it started, feeling that their life is complete and they are content without any regrets. For all the tears I've shed and all the pain I've endured, there has always been a laugh to overshadow the sadness. Sometimes, I too sit and ponder my life. Although I'm still young and many of my real experiences are yet to come, I've been through a fair amount in my short life. However, it doesn't trouble me because I've learned a great deal from what has happened. I've realized that no matter how hard you plan your life, there will always be unexpected events or people. All you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. It's not difficult to be happy; just keep an open mind and a light heart. Soon, you'll find yourself laughing along with the world and relishing your time on this amazing planet we call @LOCATION1. So, listen to your parents or the person you admire most in life. There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals. But the most important thing isn't just one thing; it's a combination of things such as love, laughter, new beginnings, old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it), the unceasing nature of the universe, and the possibility that there @MONTH1 be other planets with life, perhaps even intelligent life. It's easy to find reasons to live and even easier to find reasons to sacrifice for. Hopefully, you'll focus on finding things to live for. I recall a time when things were tough, and I thought I'd never be happy again. I felt like I didn't belong in this world with all its confusing aspects. I was at a crossroads, or so I thought, but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and wondered what I'd miss out on if I ended my journey then. What names would I give my children if I ever had the chance? Who would I marry, and would our love last? So, I finally decided that there was too much I'd miss if I ended my life so soon. After that fateful evening, I started to transform into a better person, longing for a bright future with a passionate love story to share with my children. With devotion, trust, and respect, I hope our love will endure. But that's not all I want my life to be about. I want to find inner peace in a noisy world. I want to help ensure that animals can coexist with us on this @LOCATION1, rather than being pushed aside or mistreated. I want to contribute to solving the pollution problem that we humans have largely caused. I know I'm just one person in this vast world, but even the smallest actions can make a difference. So, if I want to look back and laugh at my life, I'd better do my part in making this planet a shared and healthy home.

There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing i can think of isn't just one thing its a collection of things, such as love, laughter, new beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it) , the relentlessness of the universe, and the idea that there @MONTH1 be other planets out there that sustain life, maybe even intelligent life. Its easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for, hopefully you look for things to live for. I remember when it was hard and I thought I would never ever be happy and I felt like I wasn't right for this world and its many confusing aspects. I was at the end of my path or so I was making it out to be, but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought what would i miss out on if I ended my path now, what would I dare to name my child or children for that matter if I even have the chance to produce any.Who would I marry if i marry, will our love last or fade like morning due. so I finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if I ended it this soon. after that fateful evening I went about my life slowly molding into a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantically new but burning love story to tell to my child or children, and with devotion, trust,and respect would hopefully last. but that's not all I would want my adventure to consist of. I would want to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a scarcity, I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals not pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be on this @LOCATION1 along side us, I want to solve the pollution problem that we humans have more then helped produce. i suppose in my small way i will because in just one person and a every small thing on this very big home of ours, but as small as I am what i do or say will make an impact. so if I want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet.
31	20757	8	3	"A true story about how two close friends became friends over the joy of laughter. One sunny year, there was a boy named @PERSON1 who was eager to do something fun this @DATE1 instead of just staying cooped up in his room and mindlessly playing video games all day. So he heard of an exciting play called ""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" from a buddy and found out if he could join and lend a hand with the play. To his delight, he ended up getting a part in the play and helped backstage whenever he had the chance. @PERSON1 discovered that he thoroughly enjoyed doing the play and made a bunch of new friends. At the same time when @PERSON1 was having a blast, there was a shy girl named @ORGANIZATION1 who didn't talk much to @PERSON1 at all, but she secretly liked him and she didn't tell many people about it. @ORGANIZATION1 also tried to make as many friends as possible when doing the plays and spent as much quality time with her friends as she could. As the play started to wind down, @PERSON1 started to hang out with @PERSON2 who is @ORGANIZATION1's older brother and started to pay a little more attention to her. He found out from her brother that she liked @PERSON1, but @PERSON1 already knew that she did like him from the way she acted around him. @PERSON1 joined another play called ""@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1"" after doing ""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" because of how much fun he had in the first play. @PERSON1 found he already knew most of the people from doing the first play. So he started talking to the rest of the people who were there that @PERSON1 didn't know already. This is when @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 started talking to each other and both of them found that they enjoyed each other's infectious laughter and they became very close friends. They became such close friends very quickly because @PERSON1 was really good at making friends easily and @ORGANIZATION1 didn't have many friends or close friends. Or it could have been the fact that @ORGANIZATION1 liked him so much. @ORGANIZATION1 didn't have many friends because the kids at school would make fun of her for being so smart and then she was home - schooled and lost some of the few friends she had. @PERSON1 soon found out in their friendship that @ORGANIZATION1 was scared of @PERSON1 not wanting to be her friend because of all the friends she had already lost. By the time that the play was starting to come to an end, @PERSON1 had already noticed that @ORGANIZATION1 had liked @PERSON1 before they were friends and he asked her if she did like him. She said no at first, but then she felt bad for lying to him and told him the truth about how she did like him and how she thought that it would be best if they just stay as friends. Both of them knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 was @NUM2. So they both agreed that it would be best if they just stay as friends. As the play was ending, they used every minute of it to strengthen their friendship. By the end of the play, they both had become close friends and enjoyed the good times that they had together and also relished the laughter of one another. Even after the play, both of them still talked whenever they had the time to talk to each other, but they didn't get to see each other much. When they had the time to talk, they talked about the good times that they had with one another and how much fun they had. They also talked about the great and fun experiences they had in doing the plays. Both of them agreed that they would do the plays again next @DATE1 and looked forward to seeing each other next @DATE1 and all the great things that they would have to talk about. In the end, I think that @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 are going to be friends for a long time. Maybe when they get older they could be more than friends and have their friendship go to the next level......... only time will tell."
32	20758	8	3	"I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 truly can. Just by sharing a laugh with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first when meeting someone who is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you understand what the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. It happened in @LOCATION1, a place where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was share a hearty laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a sweltering place and the sun is usually out brightly every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out for walks with my sister and cousins or going to the beautiful beach with all my family. I remember it was a lovely day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small, cozy store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy delicious candy and other stuff to bring with us when we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. When I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing uproariously about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh heartily. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't it?"" he told me laughing. ""Yes it was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied. He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say things to hurt anyone."" I thought it was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking and then I started to laugh again. ""What did I say now?"" he asked. ""Nothing. I was just remembering what you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget what he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think it was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought it was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least what I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was spending my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparents and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live now because it's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of what I had told him because he knows what it's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how it's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, it got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because when I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time it was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""Where did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if nothing had happened. It was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations."
33	20759	8	3	"As I waited in the car, anxiously fidgeting, eager to meet my best friend and the man I'm in love with, I started to laugh nervously. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something comical, but because I was extremely nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, exchanged many many text messages, and had numerous emails with him. But I was still a bundle of nerves. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my composure. As our sleek black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got even more nervous. What if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? What if he didn't like me? What if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me with his warm, friendly eyes, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away like snow in the sun. I smiled back, my heart pounding. ""Hello, @PERSON1,"" he said, his voice soft and gentle. ""Hello @PERSON2,"" I said, butterflies fluttering wildly in my stomach. I was still smiling broadly. He reached out and cautiously took my hand, his touch sending a tingle up my arm. ""How was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. ""Long, and nerve - wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. ""But you're here now, and I'm very happy you are,"" he said, smiling warmly. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was in a dream. Here he and I were, two guys in love with one another, a new and exciting thing for both of us, and we were as happy as could be. The whole car ride we held hands and talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him. We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 all too soon and all of us got out of the car. I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half - hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table, my mother, who was overjoyed that I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with funny tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered vividly, others I did not. @PERSON2 laughed and joked with me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter turn into genuine, hearty laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table, giving it a reassuring squeeze. After we ate a delicious dinner and scrumptious dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some trendy clothes together and finally ended up in a cozy book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION3's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me intently. ""What?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously. ""You just look very... In your element,"" he smirked. ""Really?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""No problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand gently. He pulled me closer to him. We were the only people in this quiet area of the store. ""Is it okay if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head yes. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips. I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew what he was thinking just by the look on his face. ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face. ""Good,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me. I was on cloud nine. I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION2. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes were fixed on our future together. Now whenever I remember that moment, I start to giggle happily to myself. Yes, I get a strange stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been."
34	20760	8	3	Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade
35	20761	8	3	"Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it."
36	20762	8	3	"Laughter is always the key to complete happiness. All you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the third grade, I was the new student. I can clearly tell you that I didn't know where anything really was. It was a brand - new school: a new bus route, new classrooms, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be. You get made fun of a lot, and sometimes you just don't fit in. Well, that's my story. I never fit in right away.   One day, I was walking up the stairs to my class. It was a bright sunny day, and I don't believe there really were any clouds in the sky that day. Anyways, as I was walking up the stairs, I tripped and fell backwards. My skirt, which I was wearing, flipped up over my head. And of course, in that era of time, you had to have character underpants. Well, I remember everyone pointing and laughing at me. A. because I had just fell down, and B. because I was wearing Dora underpants. Therefore, I went the whole day with everyone laughing at me. But to tell you the truth, I laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny. Falling down and your underpants showing? Who doesn't think that's funny?   After the fact, this girl named Sarah came up to me and told me I'm not the only one who wears character underpants. We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid could actually be embarrassing, but for me, I've done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. Sarah and I became such great friends. We laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice - cold water, or back to the time where I fell down the stairs. Up to this day, we still talk about that. It's just something you really don't get over. Not to mention it was pretty funny when my character underpants showed.   In conclusion, I think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true. You have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day. It's just a known fact. If you don't laugh throughout your day, then something is really wrong with you. Just because you're getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?"
37	20763	8	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 blew my mind the first time I saw her. She was my other half. Everything we did together was perfect. She made me laugh with every single thing she said. She was my better half, and that would sum it all up. I still remember when I first saw her in @CAPS1. The nickname of the town was @CAPS1 @CAPS4 hell because of where it was located, right in the middle of nowhere.   We met when I was on vacation at @CAPS1. My parents had just retired a few months before and were looking for a cozy retirement home away from the big cities and closer to the good eastern @LOCATION2 mountains that seem to always have snowy tops and beautiful landscapes. We ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us. That thing was a nightmare. Every time we stopped, I would have to set everything up, even if we weren't going to use it. It was a two - hour process, and after the hundredth time, you can see how I would get bored.   Looking for a great house to stay in that town was not hard to come by. They were all amazing homemade houses. Never was a contractor paid to build these houses because the men of the town made them by hand. They were incredible two - story oak - made houses that looked like they could take a tornado and come out with only scratches. We ended up finding this one house that was so amazing that I wanted to live there right off the bat. Surprisingly, my parents wanted it too. But the sad thing is that we had to sell our house first or we wouldn't be able to afford it. So we put that house on the ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and headed back to the trailer.   We had another few days or so there, and I was officially bored out of my mind. I needed something to do besides stock the fire and make sure the hot dogs did not burn. I jumped on my dad's bike and rode into town (the trailer park was located about half a mile out of town). I arrived in town to be very disappointed. It was just as boring riding a bike around town and stopping inside the shop to make small talk as sitting by the fire in @NUM2 degree weather. In my mind, it was just another boring vacation, but little did I know it was about to get a lot more fun.   I woke up the next day and took my shower and got ready for the day. It seemed like another boring day in hell from what I could tell. To me, fun was doing stuff I normally would not do. But back then, @CAPS1 and places like that just did not cut it because all I did that @DATE1 was go to places like this and do nothing, so it was expected of me to be bored.   I rode my bike around a corner and I saw a bunch of guys and girls that looked like they just came from fishing or tubing or something fun. So I rode over to see what was going on. I started talking to a guy named @CAPS8. He told me they just got back from a youth group get - together on the snake where they went tubing and cliff jumping. I was in awe. That seemed crazy to me. Cliff jumping? Tubing? It seemed way too crazy for a youth group. But I guess that's just how they do things in @CAPS1. They just don't go have a picnic; they go do crazy stuff that I personally have not done any of the things they were talking about because, for one, I'm not crazy, and for two, I have never had the chance.   We kept talking, and before they all left, they invited me to go on their nature hike up on top of this mountain. I was more than happy to oblige, seeing as I love hiking.   I woke up in the morning feeling all hyped up and ready to rock. I had my permission slip signed and I was ready for a good - ole hike. I jumped on my dad's bike and rode into town at five in the morning and arrived at the youth administrator's house just in time for a protein shake for breakfast (he offered it to me; I did not ask). We drove to the mountain, and at the base, there were around @NUM3 to @NUM4 people all in hiking gear. It surprised me because I was not expecting so many people. That's when I met @LOCATION1. She was gorgeous, so I was attracted to her immediately. We began the climb, and I began to talk to her. We were like two peas in a pod. I couldn't get enough of her, and she of me. Her laugh made me extremely happy. She was my other half. All I can remember is her amazing laugh."
38	20764	8	3	THE @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 story is about how I fell in dog @CAPS1 and stepped in it. I also fell off of a slippery trampoline. About four or five years ago, I went to a friend's house to stay the night. That day was a sweltering hot day, so my friend and I devised a plan to have fun and stay cool. So my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler. We decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline, and when you do that, it makes the trampoline wet and slippery.   My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline. He was starting to jump higher than me, and I started losing bounce. He came back down at the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher than I normally could. Also, he weighed more than me. So I came back down and I landed on my back, and the angle I was at on the trampoline shot me off.   As I was bounced off the trampoline, I thought I was gonna get hurt. I had rather gotten a few scratches than landing on a dog's manure, but that's just what happened. I landed on a pile of dog manure, and it really stunk my shirt up so bad. But after I took my shirt off, I started jumping again, and I jumped for that whole day. I don't regret it because after that, everyone had a good laugh, including me.   So @CAPS3 story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun. Even when it could have been a bad thing that happened to you, maybe in the end, it was funny even though at the time it was not. Laughter can turn a seemingly bad situation into a memorable and enjoyable one.
39	20765	8	3	"@CAPS9 you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out.   It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and it's time to party. It was called our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" night. We call it ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" because, us @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be ""@CAPS6"".   To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started out by playing video games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed.   Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the ""@CAPS7 or @CAPS8"" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version, didn't you? Well, fortunately, we are the @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal ""I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times"" or ""@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?"". Nothing unrated about that.   After a while, everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do, which was to play sing - star on the @NUM5. But @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords over, so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS1. Since this was our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS1.   For our @CAPS1 role, it goes like this: I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13 and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON4 is the sister - in - law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering with each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot.   After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different large pizzas: Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My ""daughter"" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to panic. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life.   After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS23 movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM1 people all clutched together is the ""right"" way to contemplate a @CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS24. Everyone sitting on top of everyone was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house shut down, and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS13 started to cry, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out.   Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON6 portrayed about a possessed @CAPS26 that had no left leg and would go around"
40	20766	8	3	"Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to @CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in @PERSON1's seventh grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was chosen to be in the @ORGANIZATION2 along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION2 simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves @CAPS1-@CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The @ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused @TIME1 incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the @ORGANIZATION2. Their names were @PERSON4, @PERSON3, and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together in the @ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us closer together. I also became close with @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3. To @TIME1 day, @PERSON4 is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @PERSON3 was caught up in the popular crowd, @CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and @PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing @CAPS8, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. ""@PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @DATE2. I'm beat,"" I complained as we walked into @PERSON1's room for math right after lunch. ""@CAPS6 neither,"" she replied. ""I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work."" We made our way to the table in the back where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. @PERSON4 and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. ""@CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1 and he said that we don't have to do any work @DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out,"" I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 grinned. @PERSON3 turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to chuckle. ""@CAPS10, what's that?!"" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. @PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. ""@CAPS11 guys, I had @TIME1 crazy dream @TIME2,"" @PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. ""I went to @TIME1 @DATE1 camp thing, and @PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!"" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @TIME1, was that @PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were @CAPS8 desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, @TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the @ORGANIZATION2. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We @MONTH1 not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other."
41	20767	8	3	"Many of my friends burst out to laughter. People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best thing. Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles, true happiness, and precious memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. ""Mom, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this,"" I pleaded to my friend's mother to let me go back home. ""You need to do this honey. It's for the best."" At that point I had always thought my friend's mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying hard to hold back tears, waiting for my friend's father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think. I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way to being drunk. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at my friend's drunk father and my heart dropped. I burst out in tears while my friend's mother held me in her arms. ""It's... it's alright,"" she soothed. My friend's father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man my friend's mother had once married anymore. He had become a monster. I couldn't stand it anymore. I walked into the room where my friend's mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""Let's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until my shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on my face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to my friend's father how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""Hi. Hey."" It made me upset that my friend's father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk. ""Sir, we really need to talk. I feel as though you are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know you're addicted and there are risks with stopping but you're also endangering your health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out my heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done my friend's father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""Your mother told you to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about it. Your mom doesn't know what she's talking about."" My jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me. ""You don't even know me! You don't even care about me!"" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at my friend's mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave. This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. It meant tears. Laughter, in this instance, was a cruel mask hiding the pain and reality."
42	20768	8	3	"Laughter, often a sign of joy and mirth, can sometimes carry a deeper, more complex meaning. ""Honey, we've got something to tell you."" I knew exactly what they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that when they went into the other room, it wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce and the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells when a couple is getting married. The happiest sound one could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of what was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet and become one, her eyes had turned red and irritated. It killed me inside to see her crying, and while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love and that it all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment and anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy. At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around what was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand why this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to be off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would have used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents' relationship. Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say, ""It's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father and I."" Why did they think those statements made it better? Because it really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, and the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in Brazil. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. And more importantly than my home, my heart. It was broken and I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together. Just when it felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I will never forget. ""When you feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as a family."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. The time dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time mom and I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm and familiar. And especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives and mine. I began to laugh, and then to cry. My parents weren't sure what to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked, ""What's wrong, sweetie?"" And I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That when someone slipped on a piece of paper, it would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, and the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, and memories in our hearts, we would survive this. From then on, I solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""When you feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, it's okay to be sad, but that as long as you have laughter in your life, everything will be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If it had not been for her, I would have kept on with the water works and never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, because laughter truly is a healing force."
43	20769	8	3	"Laughter, the sense of pure happiness. You are in the moment and nothing else matters, all your worries and stress fall away leaving you with your true happy self. Have you ever had those moments when everything seems too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, once you're done laughing you start to cry because it felt so good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor and can't get up for what seems hours? Yet looking back you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magical, second only behind love. Those two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just your boyfriend/girlfriend but your friends and family too, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, and that brings you even closer together. When I'm with my close friends the one thing we seem to do most is laugh. We laugh about anything and everything that is even slightly funny. It brings us closer together, sharing a moment of pure joy. The six of us are very close and will be friends after high school is over, even if we go to colleges a thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other and can share anything with them even our most important secrets. This story is how we came to be so close. Brightly colored fancy dresses and killer high heels were splayed out across the room. Open soda cans and chip bags were scattered about. The faint smell of nail polish, flowery perfume, and deodorant lingering in the air. Laughter and giggles bubbling throughout the room with the occasional squeal. Pitch black outside but light and warm inside. Six of us lounging around the room. Smeared makeup and deflating hair. Sweat pants and baggy t-shirts. We all went from looking our very best to... not, within a few minutes. Yet not one of us cared. When looking at each other we were able to look past appearances and have fun with each other, not their looks. We had just gotten back from the prom. None of us had had dates but we still managed to have the time of our lives. ""Did you see him! He was dancing with her!"" ""I wouldn't really call that dancing...."" she made a pelvic thrust, we all burst into a new round of giggles and shouted stuff like, ""Get a room!"" We gossiped about what we saw, who was with who, pretty dresses, hot guys, creeper guys, slow dances, the music, even how we hid our cups so we would know which one was ours when we wanted to use it again. We had all been friends, but recently we had been becoming closer. Starting to move from friends to best friends. It was at least two in the morning. Everyone was exhausted but was forcing themselves to stay up with caffeine and sugar. You might ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to talk about, because we enjoy each other's company, or just because we can, so why not? ""I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us."" I said. ""Yes!"" ""Great idea!"" ""Now? I'm a mess!"" ""I've got just the thing!"" Sarah takes off running upstairs to grab something. ""Where should we sit?"" ""On the bed?"" ""Come on, move over fatties!"" ""Hey! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump!"" We all cracked up at the reference of Thanksgiving as we started to squeeze into a corner of the squishy full size bed. Sarah and Sarah's mom arrive back into the room. Sarah was carrying an old Polaroid camera that prints out the picture immediately after you took it. She gave the camera to her mom and jumped onto the bed. We all squished together, barely enough room to breathe. ""One...Two...Three!"" Click! the picture came out. ""Let's take one more while the first is developing. Again, one... two... three!"" Click! Click! ""Oh no!!!"" We all screamed in unison. The bed broke! we had broken the bed! We all sat there clinging to each other in total shock. ""Our bed! You girls are faaaaat..."" Sarah said while trying to contain a giggle. Suddenly we were in hysterics. Even Sarah's mom was laughing. We were one big throbbing pile of laughter. Only the corner of the bed had broken so we were all pulled down into that corner. Then someone started tickling, it was war. Every girl for themselves. It was a mass of bedsheets, wiggling fingers, bare feet, and a whole lot of laughing. ""Look, the pictures have developed."" The first one showed us sitting together smiling, but the second one was taken just as the bed broke. It showed the shock on our faces as we held onto each other for support. Not only did it bring us literally closer together but it solidified our amazing friendship. Laughter truly is the glue that binds us."
44	20770	8	3	Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about
45	20771	8	3	"Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that @CAPS7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. @CAPS7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS1, when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 stood back a second then said, ""aw were you waiting for me little one."" @CAPS4 replied with, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe @CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions."
46	20772	8	3	"On a particular day, at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, it's a true story about a time I had with two of my friends and squad members named @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. When we were walking back from @CAPS3 cheer - leading practice on a @DATE1 @TIME1. We had a good laugh as we walked along @CAPS3 @NUM1. I and @CAPS1 were getting cold, because we were just in shorts and sweatshirts, so we put on @CAPS1 hoods. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 wanted @CAPS3 put her hood up also so she didn't feel lonely, but her hood was too small and with her thick hair it just made it worse for her. Still, she tried @CAPS3 put her hood on anyways and her hair went on the top of her head and her curls were at the bottom of her hair. When she put her hood on, it made her look like a poodle. When we got to the end of the block that I live on, @PERSON1 said her foot was hurting, so I told her I would give her a piggy - back ride. Then she got onto my back, and I told her that once we get to the end of this block, she should set me down and we can cross the street and she can give me a piggy - back ride. So @PERSON1 gave me a piggy - back ride. After we crossed and we told @PERSON3 that it was her turn @CAPS3 give one of us a piggy - back ride, I was about @CAPS3 get on @PERSON3's back when the @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS5 just got a turn! Now it's my turn!"" @CAPS6 I was like ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1. Okay @PERSON3 give me your backpack and water bottle."" So @PERSON3 gave her stuff to me and gave @PERSON1 a piggy - back ride. Once that we got to the end of the block, I told @PERSON3 that she now had @CAPS3 give me a piggy - back ride. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 was like ""@CAPS9! I'm so tired"" In the end of that conversation she gave me what I wanted. At the end of that last block @PERSON3 set me down and we crossed the street. Then @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 drove by us yelling ""@CAPS10!"" We turned around to see who yelled that at us, and we found out it was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. I said ""@CAPS12 look it's @PERSON2! She is actually here on time!"" Once @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2 saw us, we three girls started to just bust out laughing. We started to laugh because of what @PERSON2 yelled out at us. When @PERSON2 went to go park her car, we just started walking up to her to talk to her, as she was getting out of her car. When @PERSON2 got out of her car we were just getting to her car. She walked up to us and we started to talk and walk into the school where we practice. As we were walking I said to @PERSON2 ""@CAPS5 are actually here on time!"" @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 responded by saying ""I know right?!"" We finally got to the doors and @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS12 everyone is here today!"" That is a time that I had a good laugh with more than just one person. Going to that practice was a blast that night. That night was fantastic going to cheer - leading practice. I hope to have that much fun going to practice again."
47	20773	8	3	"Freshmen year at @CAPS1 was a whole lot of fun. There was this boy who made me smile and laugh. I swore I was falling in love. We had one class together, which was called @CAPS2. Passing each other in the hallway just would make my day. We met in a class that we both didn't really care for. I would ask him for help even though I didn't need it just so I could talk to him. We also would see each other at the swimming pool because his brother swam and I did also. I would see him during the school days but not very often. Instead of him ""helping"" me, we would sit and talk about our lives, how they were at school and at home. First semester is over and he got moved out of the class to another class period. We would still talk at the pool and see each other during the school days. He would now give me hugs in the hallway. We started to become really close friends. Talking drew us even closer. Laughing was a big part in our conversations. We found out that we have a lot in common. Like hunting, wheeling, the foods we like, our favorite dog breeds and our personalities are so much alike, that it seems as if we grew up around each other. @MONTH1 came around, just one more month of school. I started to go to his house every once in a while. He came to mine more often. In the beginning of @DATE4, the strawberry festival came around and I asked him to go with me. He said okay and his parents also went but with my parents. That day was fun and enjoyable. The end of @DATE4 was finally here, school was out in a few days. Summer break was here. The last days of school were fun. It was going to be so nice not to have homework over the weekend or during the week. All we did the last days of school was sign yearbooks and tell funny stories about the school year. After school I went to swim practice and after practice he was still at the pool waiting for his brother. We were outside talking and all of the sudden out of nowhere he asked me ""will you go out with me""? I said... yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world that day. Today, in @DATE2 we are still dating. One and only relationship I have ever had. I hope we stay together. He tells me almost every day that he is going to marry me. He tells me he doesn't know what he would do without me. I told everyone I swore I was falling in love. Now everyone knows I fell in love. I fell in love at first sight. We talk and laugh all the time we hardly ever argue."
48	20774	8	3	When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1. We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled to me that he was going to catch this one, so I jumped off the four - wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen. While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net, he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole. At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole. Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree, so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole. The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice - cold river after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally I don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had.
49	20775	8	3	"One time when I was spending the night at @ORGANIZATION1's, she wanted to sleep outside in a tent. It was @DATE1 and we always tried seeing each other anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school a lot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went outside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and I was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. It was like two best friends dating two best friends, and we were closer than ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the morning, so it was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point I was just cracking up with laughter. @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd herself while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happened. So all of this was going on at around one in the morning and I was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When I looked over and saw that she had pee'd herself I yelled out ""@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!"" It was the most funniest thing, I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""@CAPS3 should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone. She was really embarrassed after that, I mean I would be too if that happened to me."
50	20776	8	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, I don't know where I would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin; @CAPS1 and I, are usually together for most of the days and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS1's dad; @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS1 on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. Laughing hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy; @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS1 because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON1 who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON1 realized that he forgot the churros, so he told @CAPS1 to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS1 left, cause @CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying ""@CAPS1 is probably going to drop them"". We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churros fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were laughing so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS1, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things I usually say is if you can't and aren't willing"
51	20777	8	3	"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I once heard ""laughter is the best medicine."" I whole - heartedly believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything and everything funny in this wonderful @CAPS3 world. Laughter is of utmost importance to me; without it, life would be an absolute bore. Sometimes, laughter is good and comes straight from the heart. Other times, it can be cruel and mean. I like to avoid that cruel and mean laughter and just stick to the good kind. When one of my friends is laughing and smiling, it makes me extremely curious to know what they're laughing about, so I can join in the fun. Birthdays are always a blast, and laughing usually accompanies the fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2 vividly. I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be truly special, so I invited my closest friends and my cousins. Family always adds that extra special touch to everything. My cousin and I are pretty close; she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a great time, both of us acting crazy and always laughing. For my party, my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, and it was incredibly delicious. Everyone had a ball, and soon the party was over. But my cousins were not leaving until the next day, so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, and my cousin came in and wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. ""This punch is so good!"" my cousin @PERSON1 said. ""I know that's why I had my mom make it."" ""Do you wanna hear a joke?"" ""Sure."" @PERSON1 said. ""Once upon a time, there was a kid named butt itches. He was really sick and one day died. His mom cried to the doctor, 'Oh, my poor butt itches!'"" ""And guess what, do you wanna know what the doctor said?"" ""What?"" asked @PERSON1. ""Itch it!"" @PERSON1 had just taken a drink of punch when I said that. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, and it got all over me. Usually when someone spits or spills something on you, you get mad. But I started cracking up laughing, and so did she. ""Oh my gosh! That's so gross."" But we could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny; it was the punch all over me and the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us, wondering what in the world had happened. You would think that getting punch spitted at your face on your @CAPS2 would make you mad. This is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case, laughter was the shortest distance between @PERSON1 and I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me. Laughter made this @CAPS2 extra special because I will never forget my twelfth @CAPS2."
52	20778	8	3	"What on earth, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and now even @CAPS2 (such a strange situation @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5). Laughter! Some say it is the best medicine. It can truly brighten a cloudy day, cure a case of the blues, and even soothe a breaking heart. On the other hand, a simple snicker or soft giggle can break a heart too! I have had first - hand experience listening to goofy squeals being thrown my way, not because I told a witty joke, but simply for sitting in my @NUM1 grade classroom and becoming the butt of my peers' jokes. Before I go on with this story, there are a few things you must know. Let alone that all @NUM1 graders have a common, undeniable urge to bring people down so they can build themselves up. I was a @NUM1 grader whose weight had reached the point at which my doctors were telling me, ""You should look into a weight - loss program."" This news alone was crushing my self - esteem, and my classmates' laughter soon brought me to tears. I can recall a particular incident, perhaps one of the worst. I was on the bus and almost home when @NUM4 girls who I thought were my friends started laughing. Little did I know it was me they were laughing at, so I joined in what I thought, and what seemed to be some innocent giggling. Suddenly they stopped, looked at me, started whispering to each other, then one of the girls blurted out between chuckles, ""You look like a beached whale!"" She said this so loudly that the whole bus heard and immediately burst into side - splitting laughter. I walked down the same street I walked down every day where the bus dropped me off. That day it seemed more gloomy than ever before. This is the day I decided I was never going to set foot on the bus again! It is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards losing weight and regaining confidence. Days, weeks, months, even years have passed since that day in the @NUM1 grade. I'm @NUM6 pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader, and proud of who I am. The tables have turned for me in many ways. I am no longer the person who gets laughed at because of my weight, but sometimes I catch myself mindlessly cracking a joke or two at someone else's expense. I can recall just the other day, I was with my best friend at the mall. She spotted this girl who was overweight and immediately started giggling and elbowing me in the side, trying to draw my attention to her like she was some freak show. When I saw the girl, my first reaction was a hideous laugh, but just as soon as I did so, I felt the same pain I felt when that bus full of my peers laughed at me. I immediately stopped, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought her. My self, I am a very funny person and will do just about anything for a laugh. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting their feelings, this is where I draw the line because I know how it feels to be in their position, and I hope that my story helps open the eyes of you and others to the harmful effects some laughter can have. So go ahead and laugh, laugh, laugh, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and even @CAPS2, just not at the expense of another person's feelings."
53	20779	8	3	Laughter is a big part of my life, and I firmly believe that we have to have laughter in a good and healthy relationship. This is a true story about laughter and its effects on my life. Laughter is a wonderful thing for your body, mind, and soul. It can lighten up a gloomy mood when I'm feeling down. I'm glad to say I have lots of relationships, many of which are blessed with laughter. My mother and I have an incredibly close relationship. Almost any time we're in the same room, there is bound to be laughter. My mother and I laugh all the time, over the silliest of things. We laugh just for the sake of laughing, and most of the time, we don't even know what we're laughing at. She has this amazing ability to make me laugh at the most ridiculous things. I'm also pretty sure she's the only person who can get me to spit my drink all over the dashboard just because of a silly face she made. My mother isn't the only one I can have a great time with. I remember a conversation I had with a good friend of mine. It was about the way people laughed. I told her about how I had noticed that people usually laughed in different vowel sounds, like a, e, and o. It seemed really odd to me that I had only ever heard people laughing in those vowels and not I and u. She thought the same thing I did, so we came up with this fun idea to laugh in the vowels I and u. Of course, people were too busy with their own lives to notice us laughing oddly, but it was a lot of fun all the same. You never really realize how hard it is to not laugh until the occasion is upon you. My mom and I were at my aunt's house, trying desperately not to laugh. We had all decided to do a facial cleansing mask we had seen on a popular TV show. The mask itself was made out of whisked egg whites and toilet paper. You dip the toilet paper in the egg whites and plaster it all over your face. You have to wait at least fifteen minutes or until it's completely dry before you can take it off; otherwise, it doesn't work. The three of us did as the instructions told us, but were dismayed when we saw the final results of our efforts. We weren't upset because we looked repulsive; we were upset because we all looked like a bunch of crazy ladies, and we found it extremely difficult not to burst into laughter. The sight of my mother and aunt was so ridiculously funny that I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. After about fifteen minutes, I came back to find my mother and aunt in the bathroom, drying each other's face with a hair dryer. After seeing this, I just couldn't stand it any longer. I started crying with laughter, my mask cracked, and all my hard work went down the drain. That day was one of the funniest days of my life. We laughed so hard that our abdomens hurt. I love to laugh, as I've said before, and I personally have many different forms of laughter. When I laugh really hard, I laugh all the air out of my lungs and forget to breathe. I have no clue what it looks like to others, but I must be a red - faced girl rocking back and forth. Other times, I kind of have a manly ha - ha, but if you're lucky, you'll get to hear me snort. The thing I'm trying to say is that laughter is a great thing, and it has made a big difference in my life. I don't know what I would do without it. I love to laugh; I think I would die if I couldn't laugh.
54	20781	8	3	"The laughter in me. To me, all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good laugh. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood you're in when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a ""sigh"" moment. For me, I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON1. Every day, she manages to say something totally off - topic, and we end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs where we eat lunch. As people walk by, they give us weird looks, but we don't care because we understand each other. To me, laughter is my way of relieving stress. My best friend agrees with me. Her name is @CAPS2; I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast - food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her house, and we share so many great and fun memories. It's really bad when we are around each other. It's like one look at each other, and boom! I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is, but it's like when we see each other, it's a rush of all the good times we've spent together coming all at once. Sometimes we laugh hysterically over nothing. It doesn't make sense, but I guess that doesn't matter when you're hanging with your best bud. Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. It shows me how fun a person can be and if they have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not be some stuck - up, want - to - be - perfect robot. All @PERSON1 and I talk about is boys and boy problems, and it makes me laugh and giggle. But when we are in our fifth - period class, forestry and fire, we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically ""high"" and all of a sudden have this outburst of energy. We sit next to each other and tickle each other and laugh really loud. By the end of class, I make a paper ball, and we play paper soccer ball. It's so much fun, especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop, and you don't listen. Let's just say that her face turns a very bright red color. Nothing compares to how much I laugh when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3, I had three classes with her: @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together. Anyway, as I was saying, I swear we had a non - stop laughter war every day. My laugh is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like it; some think it's cute; others think I laugh funny (the weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2, she'd stand next to me, look at me weirdly, or say something that didn't come out right, or sing obnoxiously. Anything she did cracked me up. It was so distracting when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from laughing with her. At home, when my family is all together, our way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different from laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mother's stomach. We make fun of my brother for being the only boy"
55	20783	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3  The beautiful flames danced so peacefully in the @CAPS1 air. The faint shimmer of the blaze was the only light we had. As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON2 to the @ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS4 and the @LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation.
56	20784	8	3	What makes you laugh? Laughter is a truly remarkable stress reliever. There are numerous different types of laughs across the world. Some people's laughs are extremely high - pitched, while others can be very deep and low, like a bass rumble. Some other people snort and make various animal - like noises when they laugh. For me, I have a wide array of laughs corresponding to all the different emotions I experience. When I am upset, I have a very distinctive laugh. Although when I'm upset, I laugh to lift my spirits and have a better day.   One time during a basketball game, I was having a truly off night. Fouls were being called on me constantly, left and right. Normally, when this happens, I get extremely mad, lose my composure, and end up being benched. I absolutely loathe sitting on the bench. This time, after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason, when I got a foul called on me, I decided to just smile and laugh about it. I told myself to shake it off. My coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and simply told me to play defense using my feet, shake off the bad call, and keep my head up. When you're mad, a person can take a lot from the angry looks you make. However, if you just smile and laugh about it, their reactions will be completely different. I'm not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. Many of us just laugh about the calls and shake them off.   I'm also a cheerleader. As a cheerleader, you should always strive to have a smile on your face and appear to be in a happy mood. I play in a basketball game every night before I go out to cheer. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that I'm in a good mood for cheering after the game. Laughing helps me a great deal in keeping calm and relaxing during the game, so I'm in a positive state for cheerleading.   My coach really emphasizes the importance of having positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong, the outcome will be far better than if we have bad attitudes. I took this advice to heart, and it has stayed with me. My coach influenced me to have a better attitude, and since then, I've tried to maintain a positive outlook. I keep my positive attitude by smiling and laughing when things in my life go awry.   A laugh can have a profound impact. I personally believe that laughing helps express the mood you're in. It's also beneficial for the body. Laughing can make you feel a hundred times better when you're feeling down. I try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times because I really don't like being in a bad mood; it's no fun. Laughing makes me feel a whole lot better.   I think that laughing is an incredibly good function for the body. When I laugh, it not only improves my mood but also the moods of the people around me. Laughing is a magical feeling that spreads throughout your body and makes you feel warm inside. I firmly believe that everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will surely make your day that much more enjoyable.
57	20785	8	3	"Laughter is often referred to as the so - called ""best medicine"". I don't believe that to be true, but my nephew might have other thoughts. My nephew was ""sick"" every school day for two weeks. ""He just doesn't like school,"" I would tell his grandma. However, the thought of school being no fun and him not liking it changed significantly for my nephew.   We let him think it was going to be another dull school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks, if they work hard, they get a party. Fortunately for them, they have been working diligently. That morning, the stubborn side of my nephew was clearly showing as he resisted every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door, my nephew did something uncharacteristic, not just for him but for five - year - olds all over the country. He stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been a more perfect setup! There were streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags; they really went all out for the first party of the year. The aroma of the food made my stomach growl with hunger. Above all, there were delicious desserts like cakes, cookies, and pie, all freshly cooked just thirty feet away. So when you walked through that door, your mouth would instantly fill with warm saliva.   These children played with amazing speed, like ninjas. One moment they were in front of you, and the next, they disappeared in the blink of an eye. It took me at least an hour to find my nephew in that small room. Then I realized it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and almost unbearable floor, my nephew was suddenly in front of me. He had this huge ear - to - ear grin on his face that startled me because he never had such a big grin unless he had a plan. He definitely had a plan, and in seconds, my face was wet.   He had been hiding a squirt gun behind his back and had an escape route planned. With the chairs and short tables arranged as they were, it was very difficult for my long legs to maneuver through them. It was extremely challenging to catch up in the room, but once we got into the hallway where I could stretch my legs, it was an easy chase. His ear - to - ear grin disappeared when I caught him, but the laughter on both sides continued. He got my face, but I got his head!   My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still have great parties, but thanks to us, there are no more squirt guns. I think if we had waited any longer, it would have taken more effort to get him to like school. My nephew is a very smart, athletic, and good - natured child. He will do just fine in school, and I pity the child who tries to fight him because he's strong and full of spirit."
58	20787	8	3	I know you guys hear the same things repeatedly, but I also know that a lot of people don't really answer the prompt you give them. Well, I'm sorry because I wasn't able to answer the prompt either. I can't remember when the last time I had a really good laugh was within the past couple of years. So, I'll tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me, laughter helps us in numerous ways. I'll talk about how laughter is beneficial for my health, how everyone's laughs are unique and can even make us laugh at them, and why laughter is so special to me.   I've always felt this strange sensation in my head after I laugh. I think it's because endorphins are being released into my brain. If I laugh too hard, my stomach starts to hurt because laughing also burns calories and works out my abdominal muscles. I also believe it benefits all three aspects of the health triangle. Socially, I laugh with my friends and it strengthens our bonds. Emotionally, laughing makes me feel happy and content. Physically, it's always fun when I work out with a friend and we share laughs.   I think that everyone's laugh is unique in its own way. I also know that sometimes it's really funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse when they laugh. Our laughs are yet another thing that makes us who we are!   Laughing is special to me because of all the people who make me laugh. My friends are like the family I've chosen for myself. My family makes me laugh and fills me with happiness every day. It's special because these people are precious to me. Laughing with my father is a different experience compared to laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends can never be the same as laughing with my significant other.   My life is centered around laughter, and it's truly special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum; it's an entirely different thing. There's nothing more fun than having a girls' night and laughing all night long, or going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is an essential part of life.   So, embrace laughter, cherish the moments when you laugh, and let it bring joy to your life.
59	20790	8	3	Laughter has been a consistent and powerful force in many of my relationships. I believe that laughter is invaluable in getting to know new people and growing closer to those you care about. In my opinion, laughter brings people closer and can transform a bad situation into a good one.   It was in the year when I was fifteen and a sophomore at my new school. It was my first year there. I've attended many schools, like the one in my old neighborhood and others. Similar to any new school, I was struggling to connect socially with my peers. Every day, I'd wake up, get ready, go to school, come home, maybe do some homework, and then go to bed. It was a monotonous cycle that I seemed trapped in.   The idea of trying to be cool and fit in didn't work very well. I realized that trying to be someone you're not only gets you so far. What kids and people in general like is when you're genuine and true to yourself. I discovered this later on, but I didn't initially realize that's what people appreciated the most. I once told myself that I didn't like pretending to be someone else because deep down, I thought I was a cool person. So, I changed my approach. I stopped trying to act cool and started being myself.   It turned out that I actually was cool, and girls found me attractive. They saw me not only as good - looking but also as a funny and likable person. My main asset, besides my looks, was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. This ability helped me gain many friends that I didn't have at the beginning. It even helped me win the heart of one of the most beautiful girls I'd ever seen.   Her name was Sarah. In my eyes, there was no girl who could compare to her. She had an hour - glass figure, caramel - colored skin, and a face like a goddess (and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl, she had many admirers, just like me. So, what chance did I have? What could I, a regular guy, offer her? Laughter. My greatest strength that had come to my rescue on many occasions.   Although our relationship didn't last as long as I'd hoped (I wanted it to be forever), it was wonderful being with her for the time we had. The things we did together and the experiences we shared are priceless. It was all because of my ability to make her laugh and put a smile on her face.   I believe that without laughter, this world wouldn't be the same place it is today. Sure, there's still crime and many horrible things happening, but imagine how much worse it would be without laughter. Joy, which I think is at the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. It allows us to move on from difficult situations.   Without laughter, it would be much harder to face the challenges of life. Laughter is like a ray of sunshine in the darkest of times, and it makes the world a more bearable place.
60	20791	8	3	Laughter can truly be the best part of life. It typically expresses feelings of happiness and joy. The expression of laughter almost seems contagious; one laugh, accompanied by a warm smile, can significantly improve someone's day. Perhaps the best thing about laughter is that it's not hard to find. There are countless things in our world that are worthy of a good laugh.   I personally find myself laughing the most when I'm around people I enjoy being with. Some people think the key to happiness might be love, joy, or being content with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with the ones you love and care for because everything seems better when they're around. They're like sunshine; everything becomes brighter in their presence.   My favorite memory filled with excessive laughter took place on a warm summer day at my friend's house just outside the city limits. It must have been around five in the evening. The summer air was warm but not oppressively hot; it was the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were hanging out, playing catch with a football, building a fire, and simply having a great time. We had all the elements needed for the best night of our lives.   The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing catch. I threw a long pass to my friend, and as he was running to catch the ball, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter quickly spread among us. That moment set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the evening seemed like it could have been taken straight out of a movie. Everything was going smoothly, and we were all in high spirits. It was the epitome of happiness. Laughter filled the air, and smiles stretched across all our faces. It was undoubtedly my best memory of laughter.   In conclusion, laughter has the power to create unforgettable moments and bring people closer together. It's a precious part of life that we should cherish and seek out. We should always try to surround ourselves with people who make us laugh and create more of these wonderful memories.
61	20792	8	3	"Laughter is the essence of life. Without the warm, infectious sound of laughter, my life would be a desolate, meaningless expanse. And without that sense of pure happiness or the gentle touch of compassion, life simply wouldn't be worth living. My sister is the only person I whole - heartedly trust with my innermost secrets. She has this magical ability to make me happy when I'm feeling down in the dumps. My sister and I share a special bond; we laugh with each other at our own silly jokes. My sister is like my other half, and we share everything, from our favorite snacks to our wildest dreams. She makes me laugh with her witty remarks and is always there when I need her a shoulder to cry on. I'll always be there for her also, through thick and thin. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I laugh and play like carefree children. One day I came off the bus from school, my heart heavy and my eyes filled with tears. All I could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a relentless river flowing. The bus appeared on the horizon, and a sense of joy fluttered in my chest with it. @CAPS1, it wasn't the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister. Right away, she could feel my pain and noticed my tear - streaked face. I could see in her face, the love and care that only a sister can offer. She asked me what's wrong, and I could hear the worry lacing her voice. My river of tears stopped, and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying to hold anything back. The words flowed through my mouth like a gushing stream. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a single pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said, ""@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh, a symphony of happiness that filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it. Laughter truly is the best medicine for the soul."
62	20793	8	3	"The night was dark and cloudy, casting a gloomy shadow over my surroundings. The shadows slithered across the street, illuminated by the passing cars and the footsteps of pedestrians under the lamp light. My day had been nothing short of depressing, and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day, I had upset my girlfriend with a thoughtless statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed, exhausted from the day's events. The words we exchanged were like fire, leaving smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger slowly diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt. I said things that were unnecessary and horrible, words that I wish I could take back. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowly being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing, and soon tears began to fall from my eyes, hot and heavy. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. It turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat, and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened, and I replied with a one - worded answer, ""@PERSON1."" @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee, and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession, bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother, and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again, and then @CAPS1 asked me, ""@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it, I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, paid, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause, I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated, but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable, and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And they have always been there, proving I can count on them. That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better than I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if you're counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it than to make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear from my life, and it will always be a source of comfort and joy."
63	20794	8	3	Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their flaws; a true friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. A friend can tell a well - timed joke and make you laugh until you cry, the kind of laugh that leaves your stomach aching and your eyes watering. Making someone laugh can always help when they think that it's not possible for their life to get any worse. Laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. You know inside that it's making them happy just from seeing the wide smile on their face, a smile that reaches their eyes and lights them up. There have been many times in my life where I have laughed so hard that I cried. There is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don't, people get suspicious and they feel like there's something wrong with me. That's literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. Laughing is my second language in life. There has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that I cried tremendously hard. My friends were staying the @TIME1 at my house, and we were just being boys, full of energy and mischief. We did so many things that made us question our sanity: we ate hot sauce by the spoon - full, feeling the fiery burn in our throats but still laughing through the pain; we watched comedy shows, our sides splitting with each joke; and we also ate ourselves sick, our bellies full but our spirits high. It was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breathe. We were laughing so hard! Nothing could make me stop laughing; I would just keep replaying every joke in my head and I'd start laughing even more. I already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. The comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did that for ten minutes straight! It was unbelievable. Making these life - long memories with my friends is something that I will never forget. I truly know how great I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences are the things I learn from, whether they're good or bad, I know that it's all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. All the laughs I share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They made a point in my day great as well. Being myself around them is great as well because I know that they have already accepted me into their lives and I don't have to try to be anyone else. Everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. I really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? I really don't think that there is any. I feel really honored that I have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. It shouldn't be any other way in my personal opinion. Live life to the fullest; why would you want to live it any other way? Laughter is the key to a happy and fulfilling life.
64	20795	8	3	It's always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, relaxing on the couch, I got a call from my friend @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear, all I could hear was a loud, heart - wrenching crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths, my voice soft and soothing. Couple minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happened. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible, that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going through my mind at that time. Even though that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confused. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confused, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her, there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relieved that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth; she just laughed and laughed and laughed hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out of the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worse. As I was laughing, I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thanked me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on, I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and can't really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh, I found out laughter was a key element of life, a powerful tool to heal the heart and lift the spirit.
65	20796	8	3	Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without @CAPS3
66	20797	8	3	"Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" To me, that means since everyone laughs, laughter is the quickest and easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because there was a time when my older brother and I didn't get along well. We hardly ever spent time together, and when we did, we'd either be arguing or ignoring each other. It wasn't a big issue as he's five years older. But once I grew older, we started seeing each other more often. So, one day, we decided to sit down and talk. We weren't sure what to say, so for the first ten minutes, we just sat in silence on the back porch in the middle of the afternoon. Then, out of nowhere, he tumbled backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we ever had. Since then, when my family gets together, there's little arguing. We all sit, share stories, and laugh. For my family and friends, laughter is a crucial part of a relationship because it brings happiness, and with happiness comes love. Love is the most important thing in life. So, I firmly say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people.""  ### Item 2 This true story might sound a bit cheesy, but it's real, and in my view, it's a love story. I'll use different names instead of the real ones. On @DATE1, after a long and tiring day at school, @PERSON1 decided to log on to @CAPS1 - book to chat with some new online friends. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she'd sent a friend request to @PERSON2. When @PERSON2 accepted the request, @PERSON1 suddenly remembered it. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started getting to know each other more and more with each passing minute. Before that, they had no idea who the other was. After a long chat, @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number so she could call or text him when off @CAPS1 - book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1, and @PERSON1 felt the same. @PERSON1 learned that @PERSON2 is a high - school sophomore, @NUM1 years old, and they have mutual friends. @PERSON1 really liked talking to @PERSON2, and @PERSON2 felt the same about @PERSON1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a great deal. It always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend, but he didn't mind. He really liked @PERSON1 and hoped he could make her happy. Then he asked @PERSON1 if she'd be his girlfriend. Without hesitation, she said, ""@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend."" ""@CAPS4 you would?"" asked @PERSON2. ""@CAPS3 why wouldn't I?"" replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6 I thought you wouldn't because you recently got out of a relationship,"" @PERSON2 answered. Days passed, and they were doing great until @PERSON1 started getting texts from her ex - boyfriend, which affected her relationship with @PERSON2. But @PERSON2 kept fighting for their relationship. One night, while on the phone, @PERSON2 asked @PERSON1 if she'd try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared but honest, saying, ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything."" Since they communicate well when laughing, @PERSON1 changed the subject and asked @PERSON2 if he'd do her a favor. Of course, @PERSON2 agreed. The favor was for him to laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor?"" @PERSON1 asked. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed again. Who'd think laughter could make a relationship so much better? It may not make it perfect, but it's far better than arguing over silly things. I believe laughter plays an excellent role in any relationship. It's like a universal language for communication. I hope you liked this true story about how laughter is important in relationships.  ### Item 3 My relationship with laughter. Well, the first time I encountered the power of laughter was when I met my boyfriend. Before that, I was constantly depressed, and my friends were fed up with it. But when my friends introduced us, I fell in love for the first time. I was finally happy, no longer depressed and alone, crying in a corner. That was the first time in almost a year that I smiled. My friends knew then that I'd found someone who'd care for me and love me for who I am. As our relationship developed, laughter became a constant presence. I was always laughing when I was with him, not sad anymore. At first, it took all our friends to encourage us to hang out. After we started spending time together, we got to know each other better than when we first met. It wasn't until freshman year that we started dating. Then, I found out that someone else thought I was dating him. I didn't believe it until that guy came up and started shouting at me. My boyfriend came and comforted me in front of my friends and said, ""@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. He tried to end things, but I told him, ""We were never dating in the first place!"" My friends saw me in tears and asked what was wrong, trying to find me someone new. By the time they did, I was with another guy, and I'm truly happy with him. He's always there for me, no matter what. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me. He makes me laugh when I'm upset or angry, saying, ""Don't worry, everything will be okay. I promise, so just believe in me."" Laughter has been part of our relationship for almost a year. We don't want to change that unless one of us messes up again. We've made so many mistakes that we're not sure what to do. If laughter leaves, I don't know what I'll do. It's now an essential part of my life and our relationship. Let's hope we can keep it together this time. This part of our relationship is the best, and I hope it won't change. If it did, I'd go back to fearing my step - dad. I'm glad I found someone. I hope laughter stays because it comes with him. No one, not even my friends and family, could make me laugh when I was crying. Now that laughter is almost always here, I can't wait for sorrow to disappear. Me and him are happy together, and I hope nothing goes wrong because we love each other deeply. I'm not my lively self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS2 of my friends say, ""@CAPS3 are losing your bubbly self. Don't let her disappear. She'll guide @CAPS3."" They also told my dad that I don't hang out with them much. The reason is that they can be bossy and tell me what I can and can't do. Can't people understand that this relationship won't work if they keep interfering? They think my life revolves around them, but it doesn't. My relationship with laughter is about me and my boyfriend, not my friends and family. That's why I'm sharing this story about my relationship with laughter. I hope this relationship has a happy ending without anyone or anything getting in the way. I wish there was a place we could go where no one would know. I hope nothing tears us apart because we love each other so much.  ### Item 4 ""Laughter"" I once heard a man say, ""Laughing is the key to happiness, and if you don't laugh, you aren't healthy."" Why do people love to laugh? Because laughing creates wonderful memories, banishes sadness, gives you energy, and can even give your abdomen a good workout depending on how hard and long you laugh. There's nothing like a really funny movie that makes you laugh so hard that you cry, your jaw aches, and your stomach is sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are comedies. I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could help you land a job. Suppose you go for an interview for a job where you'll work with people daily. Are you going to be dull and monotone? No, you'll go in, make the interviewer laugh, and act like you've known them for ages. However, laughter can be misused. It can be used in bad ways, like making fun of people just because it might seem funny. For example, calling kids in gym class names because they can't throw a baseball as far as you. Laughter can make people feel on top of the world or as bad as a basketball player missing the game - winning shot at the buzzer. Be careful when using laughter; treat it like a loaded gun because using it wrongly can hurt someone. A few hours after my @CAPS4 passed away, my family and I started talking about all the great times we'd spent with her. I noticed tears rolling down my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. Then we began to recall the times she'd get really angry and swear at my dad when he was a boy, and then get embarrassed for using the Lord's name in vain. Thinking about those moments, we started to laugh, not just a little giggle but full - on laughter. It chased away the sadness that had filled the room all night. I'll never forget how that laughter became such an emotional memory later in life.  ### Item 5 Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. Without it, my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is now. I have many people in my life who make laughter the best way to brighten my day, including my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories involving laughter, but I'll tell you about how my boyfriend used it to make me feel better when my stomach hurt. It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 as I was heading home from my boyfriend's house. My stomach started to ache, and I told my boyfriend. He said it was probably because I hadn't eaten. I was worried as it was going to be a long trip home. On the way to my house, my boyfriend tried to distract me from my stomach pain. He asked about my day at school, and I said it was okay. We talked for a while until my boyfriend took off his hat and said, ""From flat to volume!"" When he said that, I burst out laughing! I laughed so hard that my stomach, which had hurt from not eating, now ached from laughing. I laughed because my boyfriend's hair was all messed up and looked so funny. As I tried to stop laughing, I asked him why his hair was like that. He said that when he was taking a shower, he'd grabbed a shampoo bottle that said ""from flat to volume,"" and he didn't expect his hair to have so much volume. The whole way home, I couldn't stop laughing. I'd forgotten about my stomach ache. Even to this day, I still laugh about my boyfriend's hair. We have an inside joke now. Every time I say ""from flat to volume,"" we both start laughing. I know that laughter is the best medicine for me when I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life, and nothing can change that."
67	20800	8	3	"This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean ""a lot"", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... ""@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend"".  ""@CAPS4 you would?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON2.  ""@CAPS3 why wouldn't I? replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6 I thought that you wouldn't @CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship"" @PERSON2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... @PERSON1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2.But the bad thing was that @PERSON1 was still in love with @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop @PERSON2 from fighting to get @LOCATION1's @CAPS7. @PERSON1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 one night while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything.""@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have a @CAPS4 good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON1 changed the subject and @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3"". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships. "
68	20802	8	3	"My relationship with laughter.  Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time. Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When that happened for the first time in almost a year I smiled I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am.  Later in the relationship is where laughter came into play I was laughing all the time when I was around him and not upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out but, it took all of our friends to us to hang out. After we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met. It took until freshmen year for us to start dating. That is when I found out I suppose ably dating someone else and not him I didn't believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling.   He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said ""@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. Then he tried telling me it was over and I told him ""We were never dating in the first place!"". My friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS4 did I was with another guy and I'm happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or mad he says ""don't worry everything will be okay I promise so just believe in me.""  Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore. If it leaves now I don't know what I'm going to do it's apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least I hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad I'm glade that I found someone. I hope that it doesn't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I was crying not even my friends and family. Now that laughter is here almost all the time I can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS2 of my friends say "" @CAPS3 are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on @CAPS3 she is there to guide @CAPS3 down the road."" @CAPS4 also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @CAPS1 I don't is because @CAPS4 can be bossy and @CAPS4 tell me what I can and can't do. @CAPS1 can't people just understand that this relationship isn't going to work if @CAPS4 keep getting in the middle of it @CAPS4 all think that my life revolves around them and it doesn't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that's @CAPS1 I told @CAPS3 about my relationship with laughter. Lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise @CAPS3 that much. @CAPS1 can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it? I just wish that there was a world @CAPS3 could just run away to with out anyone knowing where it's at in the world. Well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad unless we start to fight again with each other I hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen."
69	20803	8	3	"Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life."
70	20804	8	3	Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!
71	20805	8	3	"Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but perhaps you've pondered it and couldn't recall. Well, this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to share how we've stayed friends for so long and all the little details that have kept our friendship strong. Admittedly, we didn't start off as friends who laughed all the time. Instead, we began as a crier and a helper.  @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just been called out of my first - period class and was greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student who had moved here from @LOCATION1 and was clearly not happy about the move. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4. I agreed and walked into the room where @PERSON3 was. When I saw her, the first thing I noticed were her tear - filled eyes as the tears streamed down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, as @PERSON1 had said, was quite unhappy. I'll admit I was a bit scared to try and show her around, seeing as she was so clearly not happy to be here. But once we started our tour, she had calmed down a great deal, yet she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble attempts to tell jokes. I still felt like I needed to make her happy, so I pulled out the big guns. I walked in a strange, wobbly way and talked in a funny, high - pitched voice. I even started saying random, silly things during long pauses. Eventually, she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end, I got her and @PERSON4 to laugh so hard that we all almost wet ourselves.  But as funny as that initial encounter was, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen, and no matter what, you always remember them when you see the person it happened with, right? Well, to say the least, @PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted, a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it even more fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class, we - @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, @CAPS1, and I - were all in @PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day, and so had @CAPS3. I randomly looked around the room and saw a really cute - looking poster I hadn't noticed before, and without realizing it, I had said aloud, ""@CAPS2, that's really cute."" @CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I'd said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to tell me what I'd just said, and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment, they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having these big memories of really funny things has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the tough ones. It also strengthens our bond within the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every small, funny thing we do together as friends has an impact later. If we only had big, grand funny moments or just boring ones, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and one of us accidentally burps or farts while walking. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle in a funny way. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together; it's how we are and who we become with that other person. I feel like I become a better person, and I believe I help her become one too. Besides, the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So, as I've stated before, laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON3 and my friendship didn't start with laughter; it started with tears and grew into a beautiful friendship filled with laughter. Laughter brought us together in an act of weirdness, and it has remained strong ever since, not only because we have a lot in common (frankly, we don't have that much in common), but because of the big, hilarious moments we've shared, not only with each other but also with other people, and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find so funny."
72	20806	8	3	"There are a couple of things that can lead strangers to feel comfortable with each other. In my experience, it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriend's parents was extremely nerve - wracking and uncomfortable. I'm a people - person and can usually get along with anyone. However, starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now, and we're the kind of people who enjoy spending time with our families. So, it was obvious that meeting his family would eventually happen. I met his parents when we were young. We attended the last years of elementary school, some of middle school, and all but one year of high school together. I left for a couple of years and came back quite different. So, after @NUM1 months of dating, I finally met his folks.  One day in @DATE1, @PERSON3 had a football game that I attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss, @PERSON3 came out of the locker room, hugged me, and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I really wanted his parents to love me put a lot of pressure on me.  I slowly walked over after him and said ""@CAPS3"" in my friendliest voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I'm @CAPS2."" I took her hand, shook it, and replied ""@CAPS3, so nice to meet you."" I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance. Then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile, and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" @CAPS4 there, I'm @PERSON2."" I shook his hand, felt less nervous, and a bit more comfortable. "" @CAPS1 , great to meet you. What did you think of the game?"" He looked surprised that I started talking, and we began a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes, @PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes, so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a very funny joke; @PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet I loved it. I took the chance anyway. I said "" @CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke."" @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that seemed to say ""oh god, don't."" I looked away and started, ""so there were two muffins in the oven. One said, 'wow, it's hot in here,' and the other screamed, 'holy crap! A talking muffin.'"" I started laughing, and my laugh is quite odd. Anyone I meet always comments on how unique my laugh is. His mother was like ""that is adorable. I'll have to tell it to @CAPS6."" I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON2 said so sweetly, ""I like your laugh. I ain't heard anything like it."" @PERSON3 came in and said, ""yes, her laugh is really something."" We all kind of smiled at each other and then went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing, and then laughing at my laugh.  Thank goodness for laughter. Once we started laughing, I felt comfortable and welcomed. To this day, whenever they see me and remember that moment, they start laughing, and they point to something and say it the way I said it. Laughter truly helped me break the ice and form a connection with my boyfriend's parents, and it continues to strengthen our relationship."
73	20807	8	3	"On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So, I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church, I attended @CAPS11 meeting until @NUM2 o'clock and then went to bible study. By then, I was tired and really ready to go home.  I then realized that @CAPS11 grandpa was nowhere to be found. He had apparently left to go home, and @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just arrived to pick us up. I was just informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting, we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there, me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. Then we went back into @PERSON1 to show off the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma.  That was a bad idea. @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking an incredibly long time. I told her that if she stopped looking at other stuff, we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwich, and come back. So, we did. When we got to @CAPS6, @PERSON2 was in a really bad mood because he was so ready to go home.  We ordered our sandwiches and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone got in the car, and we thought we were going home when all of a sudden, grandma shouted out, ""we're going to @LOCATION5's. I want a bowl of chili."" Our reaction was ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh."" We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. After getting her chili, she says, ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1."" Oh boy, that was a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 for what seemed like forever.  After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1, I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home."" All I could do was laugh. I was being video - taped by @PERSON2, and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was okay. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard that I was crying, I lost all my breath, and my face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road until I eventually fell asleep. It was a chaotic day, but all the little, unexpected events made it a memorable one."
74	20808	8	3	Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child, and I wholeheartedly believe it. I think laughing is truly important in life, and especially in relationships. In my relationship with my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, every day. And I think that's exactly why we have so much fun together. I laugh the most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2, and we were just laughing uncontrollably over nothing. That's something we do a lot. I'm just a naturally laughing person, and everybody knows that about me.  I think when I laugh, it just takes all the bad things that are happening right now and makes them seem unimportant. I have this one friend named @PERSON3, and he was the kind of person who could make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So, because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time, me and @PERSON2 were with this girl who was very quiet for some reason when she was with us. I just straight up told her that she needed to talk, or laugh, or do something. Then she opened up and actually started laughing at the funny things we were saying. See, if you're with a bunch of friends or people you're affiliated with, it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything. Just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny, even if other people don't laugh about them. Who cares? Be you.  I love, absolutely love, when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me, it means that baby is going to be a happy human. In movies and TV shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just constantly looking at the negative things.
75	20809	8	3	"@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. @CAPS2!"", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS6 his three year old son, @PERSON1, asks ""@CAPS3's @CAPS4?"". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS6 we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS5 is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS5, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5 I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first ""love"". ""I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore"", that was the last thing he said to me. My first ""love"" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS6 we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON3 told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON2 put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. ""@CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade"", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH1 seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient to everyone's life, don't forget it or life wont turn out the way that anyone would want it.   "
76	20812	8	3	"Laughter. We all need it. We need it as a reminder that there is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it as a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, as a reminder that even though we sometimes make mistakes, there is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the evening, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, as there was nothing to do. One of my best friends, Sarah, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the afternoon, and I was to be back no later than nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before Christmas. Neither of us knew what to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on Jake. This turned out to be a big problem, considering Sarah knew this piece of information. Sarah didn't have a problem with it, but Tom, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't around. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the Christmas tree first, and go from there. We both had shiny ornaments, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, you name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. Sarah got on the computer to talk to Tom for a bit, while I texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   Sarah and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, Mike, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between Mike and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. She was like a bad drug that got you really high, and then dropped you like a rock. She was extremely controlling. She wasn't right for me, and Sarah had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with Sarah, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been good at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with Sarah. She knew me much better than most people, so she knew that I needed help quick. She did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. She took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a good idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of Sarah. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   ""Please just try to relax for a minute? You're making me nervous."" she said in that tone that meant it was more of an order than a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   ""See. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" as she pulled away from the embrace, I kissed her forehead; our way of saying ""you're beautiful.""   ""Are you going to be okay?"" she asked in a worried voice.   ""Yes, I'll be fine. Thanks Sarah.""   ""Come on. You never showed me that guitar thing.""   ""What guitar thing?""   ""You said you played guitar."" then I realized that I might not ever get another friend like this one.   ""Okay. Come on. I'll show you how to play, man."
77	20813	8	3	"As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been strengthened by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are important, and they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another, they must have fun, and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain, and if two people think the same thing is funny, it brings them together with their similar interests.   By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, it brings people around more easily. Since I was young, I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be around."" Clearly, by being a seemingly happy person, it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it meant because it could mean many different things.   Whenever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselves, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absolutely nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It might be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possible. Most of the time we won't get butt hurt about it, but a lot of the time we will take it too far. With all the laughter we have shared before, it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probably the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if someone says something that doesn't make sense or came in at the wrong time. I have never understood why we laugh at pain. Maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain, although sometimes it is. Maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it, a lot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too.   Laughter will always bring people into relationships. It shows common interests and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into people's lives. Without happiness and laughter, this world would be super boring."
78	20814	8	3	"Laughter is a mystery. It happens whenever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extreme, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.   Around two months ago, in the cold winter evening. It was my sixteenth birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. When everyone arrived, they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me what was going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddy Mark and my boyfriend Tom walked into the kitchen with a sixteen - pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten - pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""Load up the cars, and let's go!""   When we approached the park, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister - in - law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extreme, and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in people's hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold, wet, and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who you were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worst. Even now the shoes I was wearing are stained.   When we got back to my house, we had to wash down with the hose. I swore I was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling out of my hair and clothing, the sauce streaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family - size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten - gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olives. You might think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend Lily dropped nachos on my couch. Mark threw nacho cheese at Lisa, she threw chips at the group by the window. Mark tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dog's fur and in all the girls' hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and the Christmas tree. So Mark finally said ""No more nachos!""   Then on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says it's just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be used to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on Tom's face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at Emily, she tossed it at Lily then the group by the window and Mark then Jake. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 live on Xbox Live. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't too pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ""I'll see you later"", ""peace out dude"". We said it all. I looked back in the living room and saw nothing but a huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken TV. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You might not see it right away. Though you will once you start laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on their faces. It might also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after those crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call Earth."
79	20815	8	3	Laughter  By PERSON1  Laughter has many benefits that make us have, or might make us have, more distance between two people, or it might make us have differences in the relationships we have with people. But many other people believe and think that laughter is an important part of any relationship with our friends, family, etc. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us, and how it can also make us have distances from people, or how laughter works in the relationships we have with friends.  Many people think that it's really fun to laugh about simple things, and that's me. I can laugh at things that might not seem funny to others, but to me they might seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many other people don't consider laughter as funny as many others do. I believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express yourself on things. Many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes. That's the reason why I think it's a great idea to do around, just have some fun and laugh.  Now talking about relationships between people. Do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship, or how could it help us (in what ways)? Well, yes, I do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationships we have with people. You get to know, and others get to know about you and how you are. Even though many relationships that we have with our friends, family, or with new people we meet, I believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses how that person is and whether they are fun people to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or doesn't have any humor at all.
80	20817	8	3	"There are times I get along with others and times I don't. There also are times where I make others laugh until they cry. Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 he was doing in there, and he said. ""I'm taking a pee."" @CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS5 gets up and says to us. ""@CAPS4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second."" @CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. ""@CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug."" That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS2 heck. Good thing I did not have to go to the rest room. "
81	20818	8	3	@CAPS4 fills the air around us with pure, unadulterated happiness and joy, like a gentle breeze carrying the sweet scent of flowers. @CAPS4 brings warm memories of loved ones that are close to us, memories that are as vivid as a well - painted picture, and adds a splash of hope to those who need @CAPS4. Laughter is truly the key to solving life's problems. @CAPS4 is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life. Laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you, a joke so bad it's good. @CAPS4 could be brought up by a show, a show that has us in stitches from start to finish, and @CAPS4 could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returned home from a long journey. Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole. The moment right when that happens you hear yourself laughing as hard as you can that you practically can't breathe and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh. Although @CAPS3 might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you. @CAPS3 is how friendships are brought up and made. Just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between two people that could either last a minute or can last a lifetime. In my case @CAPS3 is how I met one of my closest friends ever. We had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the @ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his own personal home - made flag (he got the @CAPS1 off of a show). As he was heading up the pole almost half way there he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help. A minute later the faculty members finally heard his cries and yells and tried to get him down from where he was. @CAPS4 took them almost half an hour to get him down. @CAPS3 was the moment where I had made one of the greatest friendships I've ever had in my life. Many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other. God laughs last. @CAPS3 is the name of @PERSON1 son of @CAPS2 and @PERSON2. In @CAPS3 story @PERSON2 the @CAPS5 of @PERSON1 claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news. Being surprised or shocked can also bring someone to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did themselves. I remembered a time when I laughed at something that took me by surprise. @CAPS4 was when my @CAPS5 lost the keys to the house inside the car. We looked for them everywhere but had no luck finding them. After an hour had passed we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house. After we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get there but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my @CAPS5 found the key that she lost inside her pocket (@CAPS4 was a typical cartoon moment). When we heard the news we all just started laughing at what had just happened. We were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see being surprised can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someone's face. Picture yourself staring into the eyes of someone close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing non - stop for no reason. That is basically an everyday thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't stare at each other for even a minute. We eventually start laughing in the first five seconds and end up laughing for a whole hour without stop. But as soon as we stop laughing we notice that we were laughing for no apparent reason, which would make us laugh for another hour more. That the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get, the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all. @CAPS3 shows the connection two people have with each other the type where you know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memories of family gatherings for the holidays, friendships we made when we were in school, memories of our childhood and how things we thought then were in style and cool are now things we look back into and laugh at, by being a little surprised, and can also be The fact that we know someone by heart.
82	20819	8	3	Laughter I laugh every single day. I feel a wide range of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be clearly seen. When I laugh, I usually feel happy afterwards, unless I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad, I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad, I tend to rely on laughter to get me through my day because if I didn't have laughter, I would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry, the only way I can laugh is if a friend or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times I've had. It makes me genuinely happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am angry. I also laugh at things people say to me even though they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy, all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter truly brightens my life when it's a happy laugh. My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours about nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew, my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I firmly believe that every single person needs some laughter in their life to be truly happy. Laughter is like a warm light in the darkness of life, always there to bring a bit of cheer.
83	20821	8	3	"Laughter's @CAPS1 Laughter is everywhere. It could be three doors down, reclining in a comfy living room where people are sharing stories and having a great time. It could be at the nearest playground, bouncing on the teeter - totter as kids enjoy the simple pleasure of play. It could be at an elegant restaurant, sitting at a petite table in the distant corner, where a couple is sharing a funny moment. For me, it lingered in an old fifth - grade classroom. I stumbled through the doorway carrying @CAPS11 purple backpack and @CAPS11 lunch pale resting in @CAPS11 left hand. I recognized everyone from @CAPS11 previous years of elementary school, and shortly joined them after visiting @CAPS11 hook outside the door. I had been waiting anxiously for @CAPS11 turn at the fifth grade. The legendary @PERSON1, was known as the ""coolest"" teacher around. He played a large role in the gossip of the young students, and each of us had our hopes set high. ""@CAPS2 your seats @NUM1 graders!"" announced @PERSON1 @CAPS3 with a contagious smile. Kids scattered around the room searching for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened attentively to @PERSON1's introduction to the year. His voice caught our full attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He appeared very nice as most teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. The sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch. The day finally reached an end, not satisfying the eager children. The next day rose quickly and I trudged back to the disappointing classroom. To @CAPS11 surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. The classroom had experienced a drastic change. Every wall was filled with endless color. Posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words. A fancy popcorn machine rested in the back of the room. Fresh popcorn overflowed from inside. The smell traveled through our needy nostrils as we entered. Mr. @CAPS3 sat contently at his broad desk as we made our way to our seats once again. He welcomed us to our second day. After the first couple minutes of class I had found that the rumors were true. He had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class. His ideas and word choice related to us as @NUM1 graders. We found his subtle jokes quite amusing to our young minds. He spoke like we spoke, he acted like we acted, and he joked like we joked. He even created customized nicknames for each of us. Laughter hung over our heads like a heavy @CAPS1, never continuing along. Weekly popcorn servers would hand out stuffed bags to all the kids as the class read aloud. Kids became ecstatic on jeopardy @CAPS4, gathering teams as quick as possible. His classroom became a place that we wanted to stay forever, never parting from hour - long games and water - chugging contests. Despite the everlasting fun and games, @PERSON1 showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and worth. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story that we want heard. He would plan one - on - one time with students struggling in a particular subject, and next class their confidence had bloomed. He had an ability to reach into our minds, find out who we were, and emerge that hidden confidence to become @CAPS9. We respected him, yet felt comfortable messing around with him during class as he had frequently done to us. @PERSON1 gave us a craving to learn. @DATE1 @TIME1, I had began to walk home, when @PERSON1 @CAPS3 stopped me at the door. ""@CAPS6 @PERSON2C!"" I unexpectedly said in a high tone, not hiding @CAPS11 enthusiasm. He chuckled, ""@CAPS7 fun at class today?"" ""@CAPS8 yeah,"" I answered with a grin. ""I'm glad"" he continued, then changing the subject, ""I was thinking about having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do @CAPS10 think that would be a good idea?"" I snickered to myself, trying to comprehend the fact that an adult had said this to me, ""That would be so fun."" ""@CAPS9,"" he expressed quite excited, ""@CAPS10 are a really neat kid, @CAPS10 know that? It's a lot of fun having @CAPS10 in class."" @CAPS11 face lit up. I stood there smiling for quite some time. We finished our slight conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class yearned to be liked by @PERSON1, as if he were the most popular kid at school. I was liked by @PERSON2 I was liked by the man that changed @CAPS11 whole outlook on education and life. Gradually, from time to time, I drift back to the careless days of @NUM1 grade and @PERSON2 I still laugh at the ridiculous events that occurred in that small classroom each and every day. Frequently, I glance above me to witness that dense @CAPS1 that still hovers above me. Laughter has left a deep mark on me, and those kids of @CAPS11 @NUM1 grade class."
84	20822	8	3	"Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my spirits when I'm having a bad day. It is often the ice - breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have. On the first day of school, freshman year, I met a girl named @LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @CAPS1 sitting between us. @CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomfortable. I looked up and saw that @LOCATION1 had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing. I smiled at her and mouthed the word ""awkward"" when @CAPS1 turned away. This was her cue that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I didn't know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around, we found out that we had every single one of our classes together, except @CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, and I'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary. Nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter. Sometimes, we don't have to say anything at all. I'll just look at her, and we'll burst out laughing. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we start laughing, they'll look at each other, and then at us for a clue as"
85	20823	8	3	"Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."
86	20824	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter is truly one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in the middle of an argument, a simple laugh can quickly turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show this sudden turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a soft chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter - filled relationships is an important element to someone's well - being. Sharing a @CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no real connection, no joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own unique @CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's distinct @CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he carefully sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS4' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life, as it enriches every aspect of our existence."
87	20825	8	3	In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust are very important in a relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 years of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more than anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each other's mistakes. When one of us messes up, the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something, we are always the first to know about what it was, with whom it was, even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think, is something else that is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if it's for the littlest and stupidest things. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up our lives too much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have a strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. With trust, you can tell someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her know everything there is to know about each other. If you want to know something about me, you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to know something about her, you could go to me and I could tell you. I could tell her anything, even if she is going to be mad at me for a while. If I ever really needed her to be there for me, I know she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We know what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other's mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for whatever reason it @MONTH1 be. Those are the @NUM3 things I think you need to have a good relationship with someone like I do with my cousin @CAPS1. And I still have this relationship with her and I will never be able to lose it no matter how hard I try, because she is an irreplaceable part of my life.
88	20826	8	3	"Bell rings.  Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. Snap. EEEE. Crack. Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Creak. Shoof, shoof.  Sigh. Seventh class of the day. Here we go. ""@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? On a +¨tude cette class - l+·. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...."" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate - haired and mocha - skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about.  I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.  But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three - person wide staircase side - by - side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking animatedly. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst, loneliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightning, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.  Bell rings, signaling the end of this unexpected moment of connection."
89	20827	8	3	"I didn't believe my grandfather when @CAPS2 told me laughing could cure anything. I was nine years old, and the days were dark and cold. I felt like my life was a shattered piece of a stain - glass window. Not only had @PERSON2, my ageless pit bull, just died, but also my little sister would tease me if I dared to shed a tear for the loss of my best pet. I sat on the couch, staring at the fire as it crackled and popped, when my grandfather sat down beside me and told me a story. It was about him, when @CAPS2 was young and how he lost his best friend too, only @CAPS1 friend wasn't a pet. ""@CAPS1 name was @PERSON3,"" @CAPS2 began, ""@CAPS3 we were eleven years old. Oh, how we had so much fun. All we did was @CAPS7! We thought we were gonna grow old together, be each other's best men and cause trouble until the end. @CAPS2 was my best friend until the end. I loved him, very much like how you love @PERSON2. I never thought anything would happen to him. I thought that we'd both live forever. But then something did happen. @PERSON3, @CAPS2 had gone fishing alone because I was at church and @CAPS1 @CAPS4 had to work, and it was such a wonderful day to head down to the river. And then @CAPS2 never came back from the river..."" @CAPS5 sniffled at the old story, "" And you see, @PERSON1, there's a cure for sadness. Do you want to know what it is?"" I nodded, half - thinking there was a magical medication or spell. ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS2 said. ""@CAPS9?!"" I was utterly shocked. ""@CAPS10, it's simply,"" @CAPS2 said gently, knowing my easy temper, ""going through the stages of grieving. Feel lost for a little bit, and then find your way back home. @CAPS7 is in your heart and always will be. Find a wave of joy and go with the flow. Love life, because, as you have just seen, it can be so short."" I nodded but didn't look at @CAPS1's sober face. @CAPS2 kissed the top of my head. @CAPS2 looked into my eyes (I didn't dare meet the intensity of @CAPS1) and I knew @CAPS2 saw the reflection of the fire blazing in my watery green - blue eyes and could see me processing what @CAPS2 had just told me. Then @CAPS2 left me alone to think. I needed to move on? How? Life wasn't that easy. I knew that. I opened up my notebook to do some homework to get my mind off @PERSON2, @CAPS5, and @PERSON3. That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of my eye. It was of me and @PERSON2.

91	20829	8	3	"My friend @PERSON1 and I have had @CAPS1 friends since as far back as sixth grade. We have gone through so much together. Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out outside of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I firmly believe that if you are going to have a friendship that is going to last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I were in @NUM1 grade, we were the biggest students to the sixth - graders because we were in the highest grade in our middle school. We had so many things to do. @PERSON1 and I would always walk down the hallways, linking our arms together. And one moment after another, she would just suddenly push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall, and we would just laugh our butts off. It was fun to us, but the other people kinda minded, though not that badly.   Another thing we would do to make ourselves laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each other's mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth, and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 knew that I'm like the most ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we were in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we were laughing our butts off on the floor. Well, a teacher came and told us to stop, and then the bell rang, so we just went to our classes. Well, @PERSON1 was the office aid, and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we were going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said ""@CAPS3"" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a very good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off with laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth - grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats, and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it, and soon enough she introduced herself, and so did I. Well, the seating arrangement changed, and she sat somewhere else, and so did I. Well, the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere else. He told me yes, so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care, and so then on out we started hanging out in school together and had so much fun. So you see, laughter is a great deal in a lot of people's lives. You need it. Without it, I would have never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world, we would probably be lost. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life."
92	20830	8	3	I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the Bulldogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in the first half, and before the first half got over, one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and put in the other goalie. One of the other team players kicked the ball so hard that it hit the goalie right in the stomach. So it knocked the wind out of him, and me and the whole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down, saying that he was going to pass out when he just got his wind knocked out. So then our first goalie who got injured had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie since they were too scared that the opponents would score on them. After the first half, we scored @NUM1 goals, so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3. The reason that we were laughing at the goalie was because it was really funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also, because he was our friend; if he wasn't, we wouldn't have laughed about it. But after the game was over, we asked him if he was alright, and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't. The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalies got his wind knocked out and he was over - reacting when he only got his wind knocked out. And how he was saying that he was going to pass out, and when he said it, he said it with a smile on his face like if he was faking it. This incident shows that sometimes in the heat of the moment, unexpected and comical situations can occur during a game, and it becomes a memorable part of our sports experience.
93	20831	8	3	"Laughter is something that is present when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, and it makes us smile. Many times, there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example, someone trips over your backpack and falls flat on their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't have laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how they fell, and you think about it and end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life; there isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun, and they always make me laugh. There isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family and how embarrassment is involved.   It is a beautiful sunny day on @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1, and sat down on a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" I got my hair done, did my make - up, put my dress on, went outside to take pictures, and got into the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church, I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz, I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner, and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls, and the guys were supposed to spell my name as they ran in front of me and the girls. When one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black at each end, but they ended up spelling ""@CAPS8""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left, and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, they ended up spelling ""@CAPS9""! I'm not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could have stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end, it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing, and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor, I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matter if we are sad because one of my family members was in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, and we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness that binds us together as a family."
94	20832	8	3	"Laughter is a great thing, except for some instances. We all have been there. Having a good time with friends, laughing and making new memories. Then you take a drink of something and start laughing again. Next thing you know you're choking and can't breathe. You're coughing as much as you can, trying to stop. It's not only a little embarrassing, but it can get a little awkward too. You can't stop it, you just have to let nature take its course. Everyone stares, asking if you're alright. The moment feels like forever, and that was exactly how I felt.   I have two best friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. It was during the @DATE1, and we decided to have ourselves a little movie night at @ORGANIZATION3's house. We were fully prepared with candy, soda pops, and the best of all, pizza. It all added up for a great night. We decided to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION1. It's all of our favorites; I don't think we could ever grow tired of it. @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and I found comfortable seating arrangements and started to watch the movie. We were eating, laughing hard - core, and making comments along with it. We were having a great time.   Then I decided to take a drink of my @ORGANIZATION2. I was about to swallow it, but just my luck, one of the funniest parts in the movie was on. I started to laugh and knew I had an issue. I put my cup on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the liquid in my mouth came flying out onto the floor. I couldn't breathe and was now coughing, so I kept running to my destination, the kitchen sink. I was about two feet away from the sink; I was so close! Then I felt something come up my mouth that I couldn't control. I wasn't going to open my mouth; it'd be all over the floor! I was so grossed out I basically threw myself at the sink. My mouth opened, and there went the puke, into the sink. I continued to cough, wondering when it would all end.   ""Are you okay?!"" @CAPS1 ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me out. @CAPS1 hit me three times, then I could finally breathe again. ""Thanks, I was having a hard time."" @CAPS1 started laughing, while I was still disgusted with the nasty taste left in my mouth. I put my head under the faucet trying to clear it out a little. I grabbed a towel, and we made our way to the living room. We entered the room to find @PERSON1 sitting on the couch, laughing hysterically. @CAPS1 sat by her and started to giggle a little along with her. I got on my knees and started wiping up the @ORGANIZATION2 spill on the floor. There wasn't too much, but still a good amount. I started to chuckle a little to myself while cleaning it up. I thought to myself, ""Why must I always be the one to choke?"" ""Didn't you just go to the bathroom sink? I mean it's right there!"" @PERSON1 was pointing to the door and still laughing. ""I didn't think of that! I just ran for the kitchen!"" I've been to her house plenty of times before, but the bathroom slipped my mind. I laughed at how much of a blond moment I had just had. ""Oh my gosh,"" @CAPS1 laughed a little then continued, ""Reminds me of that time!"" ""Come on and watch the movie!"" I told her jokingly. @CAPS1 finished laughing, and we were enjoying the movie in peace again. They both still tease me about that, but I don't mind. It just goes to show you that while laughter usually brings joy, sometimes it can lead to unexpected and somewhat messy situations, yet it still remains an important part of our friendships."

96	20835	8	3	Has there ever been a person that you know, that just made you laugh like no one else could? Or had a moment or a @DATE1 when you laughed as if there was no tomorrow? Laughter is something that everyone can relate to no matter the age or the personality. It fills you with a warm feeling that spills out like a waterfall. There isn't always a reason for the things that people do, there is always mystery. The same thing applies to laughter. Sometimes you are just so happy that it all builds up inside and has to be let out.  During the @DATE2 of my sixth, going on seventh grade year, my friend @PERSON1 and I were nearly inseparable. @PERSON1 was the first friend that I had made upon moving from @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 in the beginning of my sixth grade year. In that short amount of time, we quickly became best friends, sharing all our joys and little secrets.  On @DATE1, we were at my house by ourselves and we wanted to do something fun and creative. So we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture. We took chairs, the ends of some couches, and @DATE1 tables and tied sheets and blankets from them. We were so excited that we kept falling over ourselves and not paying attention to anything else. We made a plane of fabric about three or four feet above the ground, tall enough to crawl under and sit down comfortably. We then took a tack in the wall and pinned a sheet to hang over the flat sheet as our walls. After that, we filled the makeshift tent with soft pillows and warm blankets to sit on.  By the @DATE1 of our adventure, the living room was a complete mess and the furniture was all over the place. It was as if a tornado had run through the house, even though it wasn't the biggest or best fort we had built. But we didn't care, we had a blast building it. I remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up. We talked about school, the funny things our classmates did, people and just life in general. We made jokes like we love to do and just fed off of each other's good feelings and energy. I was on cloud nine and no one was about to bring me down.  That @DATE1, I laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world. I was carefree and wasn't afraid to show it. We were both laughing almost constantly to the point of tears. Even though, when I look back now some of the things that we laughed about, weren't all that funny. It was one of those days with the laughs that fill you up with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself, and it is so contagious that others can't help but join you. We let ourselves out in cries of joy and cackles. I had never laughed so hard in my life and I never wanted it to stop. It wasn't necessarily because of something funny that @PERSON1 had done or said, but I was just so happy that everything seemed worthy of laughing about. And every time I started to laugh, she couldn't help but join me, and that would just set us off laughing harder.  By the @DATE1, we were both emotionally drained. @PERSON1 ended up staying the night because we never wanted the @DATE1 to leave. But, eventually, every @DATE1 ends, every morning is a new beginning and every night an @DATE1 to something. But when you close your eyes to sleep after a long @DATE1 of laughing, you feel full. Not of just happiness, but of life. And that feeling, is not something that is easily taken away. So live and laugh like today is the last @DATE1, and never forget the memories that you created in the times before.
97	20836	8	3	The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me, laughter is incredibly important. We all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay close attention. With laughter, we can create memories that last a lifetime.  For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every single moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. What has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the wonderful memories we have created through laughter.  One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner - tubing together. There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominant, is when we had gone inner - tubing for the first time.  It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a really good friend and understood. So when we did hang out, it was always so much fun.  Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each other's houses and go to different places together.  Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parents had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going to. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner - tubing. It was exciting, and nerve - racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.  Going inner - tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1, whenever possible, we had gone inner - tubing. For me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it.  When inner - tubing, we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also, when inner - tubing, we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it. That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter, we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter, I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great.
98	20838	8	3	I've always loved laughter in my life. I don't know how I could live without it. This is how it all started out. One day, I was not having a good day. Nothing could have made me laugh. Friends would tell me jokes, they would make funny faces. That just didn't make me laugh one bit.  There was just that one thing they hadn't tried that made me laugh, until my sister completed that one thing. I would never forget this day when my sister and I had a water balloon fight. On a hot @DATE1 day, my sister and I would always play water balloon fights. This one time, she threw one water balloon and it hit my face right on. I also threw one water balloon and guess what happened? It hit her face. We just could not stop laughing. We were just breathless from all that laughter.  My sister decided to tell me that story when I was not having a good day, even when people tried to make it better by making me laugh. The one thing no one said was that one time during the @DATE1. Until my sister reminded me of it and told me that story. I just started laughing from that day on.  Then my sister took me outside. She had all the water balloons ready. We started throwing them at each other. That day when it was a not - good day turned out to be the best day of my life. That's a day I would never forget because of laughter. That's why I love laughter in my life. It just makes my not - good days turn into the best day of my life.
99	20839	8	3	One day me and my friend Taylor got the idea on a snow day to get his quad and tie a rope to the back. He was drifting around a post. He didn't see the hill and I was on the back on a sled. I flew over the quad and got about @NUM1 feet high then crashed. It hurt a bit, but it was so funny that we both couldn't stop laughing for ten minutes.  Then we went back to his creek. It was frozen about @NUM2 inches thick. Then I was driving the quad and he was in the back. I was driving along the bank and he was on the ice. Then it started to crack. I could hear the cracking sound getting louder and louder. So I went faster so he didn't fall in.  After about two minutes, the ice cracked and he went under. I quickly stopped the quad and got him out. Then I drove as fast as the quad could go and got back to his house. He changed his wet clothes and then he just sat there and laughed for hours about what we both did. Those crazy and funny moments on that snow - filled day will always stay in my memory, reminding me of the joy of friendship and laughter.
100	20840	8	3	"In any situation, laughter is used. Many times have I been in an awkward position that I have used laughter to free myself from discomfort. Laughter will never go away and you will always have it with you to use when it is needed in a revolting moment.  For example, @CAPS1 a month ago I was walking to the park with my brother and some friends of mine. When we arrived there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to skate at. We decided no big deal we will just go on with our business and skate.  ""@CAPS2 punks! we were here first!"" one of them said. Me and my brother started yelling back. Then one of them got in my face and started talking a bunch of trash. So I said something @CAPS1 him that was so funny that all his friends laughed out loud. He was pretty pissed off but it didn't matter because we ended up skating there anyway and nothing went down.  This just comes to show that laughter can bring us all together at any given moment. No matter the skin color or where you're from, you can always be funny. Some people may be funnier than others but everyone has a sense of humor within them. You can always find the time to make a joke or come up with a clever hilarious line for someone to laugh their brains out at.  Laughter is the one thing you can count on in an awkward position or when you go to a new school or have never been somewhere before. Laughter can always keep you out of fights no matter what. All around the world, people are laughing at this very moment and bonding by it. It is the sign of happiness and gratefulness. Laughter has a purpose and will never disappear. Laughter is bonding. Bonding is loving. Laughter is what brings us all together in harmony."
101	20841	8	3	"As we understand the numerous benefits of laughter, such as its ability to relieve stress and bring people closer, we realize that we simply can't live without it. It's one of those precious things that are always going to be with us through tough times, like a warm embrace, and the joy of life, like a bright sunshine. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well, they're right! You can think anything you want to, but I want you to know that I have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy I have fallen for. It all started on a softball tournament in Bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably too nice for our rowdy team, because we ended up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room after a big win, hence the hard practices. After our practice, we go ahead and swim in the pool, even though we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because it was way too cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while, two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys, I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell they're just sitting there pretending to mind their own business, and I know for a fact that's not why. We talk and laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and I hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say goodbye forever. Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had no idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy I kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later, I get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So I assumed that it was him, and I got all excited! So we snuck out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like I could conquer everything that came my way. About forty-five minutes passed, still gazing into each other's eyes, feeling like it had only been a second. His friend @PERSON2 sees someone walking out of the hotel room and realizes that it's his mom. They bolt off saying their goodbyes and at the last second, he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have I experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all, I understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that I would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1 and I live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day I will meet him again. Maybe someday I would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will I fall in love with him. All those maybes have came true, because I followed what was right and I waited. Now since that all happened, I can ponder and relate to laughter and how it affected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life."
102	20842	8	3	"I kept my head low as I slowly walked through the long halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I just couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could clearly remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I nervously entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to enthusiastically recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair. Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and quickly brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention. ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly. I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me."" @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class."" I nodded and reached into my backpack, carefully pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie - looking girl took a seat beside me. @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe it was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or it could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence. ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you."" ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before."" @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and I could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about. ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily. @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,"" I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends. We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was too stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along."
103	20844	8	3	"I'm going to tell you about moments, sometimes even adventures with a boy named @CAPS1.C. @CAPS4 has brown hair that is up to his neck, that @CAPS4 loves to swoosh around like the cool guys in the movies. @CAPS4 most definitely doesn't like his bangs cut too short otherwise the swoosh will not turn out the same way. @CAPS4 has brown eyes that just seem to sparkle with mischief and a smile that seems to fool everyone. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS4's so adorable"", they say. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS4 so cute"", they say. @CAPS1.C is cute, but does things that will amaze you! Things you wouldn't think a kid his age could make possible. Like I always say, ""@CAPS4'll make you work for your money!"" The thing is @CAPS4's only @NUM1 years of age, well right now @CAPS17. @CAPS4 loves the attention, @CAPS4'll do almost anything for it. Yet @CAPS4's very lovable and sometimes sweet. @CAPS4 loves comedy, cartoons, candy, video games, the whole shebang. @CAPS1.C is lots of fun, believe me when I say you'll never get bored! I think when @CAPS4 was @NUM2 1/@NUM2 when the adventures began. @CAPS4 would always go in the refrigerator and just stare at the egg cartons and double - check if anyone was around. Then @CAPS4'd grab one and toss it and say, ""@CAPS5, chicken?"" with a baby - type accent, so adorable! but @CAPS4'd try another and another and another until all the eggs were splattered all over the place. @CAPS4'd run off knowing we're coming close to him and hide in his little secret spots. I must admit I didn't know who was doing all this at first. I kind of thought it was @CAPS1.C, but wasn't too sure. That was only one mischief. @CAPS4 also loved this aquarium that was there, very bright because of the light it just seem to attract him like a magnet. @CAPS4'd get closer and closer and just stare at the fishes. Watching them swim, all the different pretty colors. The rocks and the little toys seemed to attract him more. When @CAPS5 one was around @CAPS4'd lean above the tank and stick his hand in very carefully and say, ""@CAPS7!"" trying to attempt to grab it, but with no success. When @CAPS4 heard that someone was coming or getting closer to him @CAPS4'd run so fast like the Roadrunner from Looney Tunes always outsmarting the Coyote. There would be a mess, of course. Though everyone knew @CAPS4'd be trouble once @CAPS4'd start walking! @CAPS4 was so cute though. Now when @CAPS4 was between the ages @NUM4 and @NUM5, @CAPS4 just loved picking at people just for the fun of it, or so we thought. @CAPS4 did it for the attention so we'd go drop what we were doing and go run after him. What @CAPS4'd do was grab something that was valuable to a certain person and go up to them and say, ""@CAPS8! me have, me have."" Of course, we had to go run after him, but sometimes you'd have to be careful because if not @CAPS4'd toss it and wham! It would break. There's only a few things I'm pointing out here, but in reality there was much more and it was more exciting than I might be explaining it! Age @NUM5 was a workout! One day we decide to lend @CAPS1.C our @CAPS10 touch to entertain him because we were busy doing our own things and @CAPS1.C discovers YouTube! @CAPS4 loves this show called @CAPS12 and @CAPS13! In other words @CAPS4 calls it, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS16."" Whenever @CAPS4'd go on it and watch most of the TV shows on the @CAPS10 touch and use the apps on it! @CAPS4 is very smart when it comes to using electronics if I may add. The day after that @CAPS4'd ask for the @CAPS10 touch almost frequently and then every time @CAPS4 was denied of using it, @CAPS4'd go to his methods in getting it! Of course what @CAPS4 did was, when lights were out and everyone"
104	20846	8	3	"Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least @PERCENT1 of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. ""I'm sure you can even think of one"".  In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our ""human"" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way.  I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have much friends. One day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was @CAPS1 excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. That's were I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. @CAPS1 I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me awhile, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter @MONTH1 not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my life time. Laughter has made me stronger and to be a better person, even if it means turning down popular kids @CAPS1 you don't hurt those closest to you.""@CAPS1 go out and make somebody laugh today""."
105	20847	8	3	Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time.
106	20848	8	3	"Laughter is something everyone truly needs in their life. We all genuinely need some humor, and even at times, we need to have the ability to laugh at ourselves. You definitely need a hearty laugh, a warm smile, and a great sense of humor to live life to its absolute fullest. When people take what others have said in a different way, or even think a joke was said a bit too harshly, and they end up taking it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I really feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, during my sophomore year, I was going through an extremely rough time. With friends and family becoming more and more distant from each other. I literally don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was incredibly hard trying to crack a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was slowly coming to a close, I realized there was more to life than just moping around in my own self - pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I firmly knew I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my special year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After being all sad and not having any fun, and then laughing heartily at the jokes my dad made about me, I knew I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had so many more laughs that I couldn't even clearly remember having. It was a truly wonderful memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self - esteem was getting a lot better than it used to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was much more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life than just getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just truly appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans - gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2 - book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile. It is clear that laughter enriches our lives in countless ways, and we should always cherish those moments of joy."
107	20849	8	3	"In a relationship you should be able to whole - heartedly trust in each other, sincerely confide in each other, openly talk with each other, empathetically cry with each other and most importantly joyfully laugh with each other. Many people firmly believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely whole - heartedly agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend, and boyfriend, @PERSON2. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a genuine smile and a little giggle from me. I constantly thank @CAPS1 for putting him in my life.  The first thing that I really clearly noticed about @PERSON2 when I started to get to know him better, is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird and hilarious faces at me or tickling me until I can barely catch my breath, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am balling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME1 I had had a truly terrible day at school and within a few short minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a funny face and start laughing uncontrollably. There's something about those bright blue eyes and that dorky yet endearing smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great and wonderful aspect of our relationship since the very beginning. When we play @CAPS2, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how incredibly bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. ""That just works out, don't it!"" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have so much fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets ""the point"" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. Whenever there is a camera around @PERSON2 likes to make really funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at yourself. One time, @PERSON2, his little sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead. @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground. His whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off.  Even when things get rough or we disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things. Most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, but we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh.  Obviously I have reason to agree with the statement ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON2 in my life. His ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between ""@CAPS3"" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it ""we're freaking soul mates!"" Laughter truly is the glue that holds our relationship together."
108	20850	8	3	"Every day I spend with my girlfriend is a day filled with pure fun and hearty laughter. I can be in the absolute worst of moods and she can brighten my whole day with just a couple of well - chosen words. Together we can transform any situation into a happy one. What I'm trying to say is that laughter is an extremely powerful thing. By making someone laugh, you can change their mood, their day or in some cases maybe even change their whole life. People say that laughter is very contagious. I firmly believe that is true. Take comedians for example, they have the amazing ability to take any situation and make a whole room burst with laughter. My favorite one is when this one comedian said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 shivering in the cold, we will bring him silver and gold"", like the well - known song. He then said "" @CAPS4 don't they? Why don't they bring him some blankets, I mean come on, the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he will be rich when he does"". I wrote this paper to clearly show how powerful laughter is in the world. I believe that everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world a brighter and more pleasant place.   I conclude with this "" A smile can light up a room but laughter can change the world into a happier place"". Nobody should go through life without the wonderful gift of laughter. "" A life without laughter is a life not fully lived"". Laughter has the power to heal, to connect, and to make every moment more memorable."
109	20851	8	3	"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago when I met my friend @CAPS1. I met her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's area, and @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both really mad at each other and just angrily saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where you're going!"" After we both calmed down, we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes later, she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for a little while, until I sincerely apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 it's okay, I should've been watching where I was going other than just watching the floor as I walked."" We laughed for a short while until it was our turn to get some food. After we paid, I politely asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were busy doing more shopping. We started to have a friendly conversation about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both had a deep love for band. @CAPS1 and I then just noticed that we had met before once at a band competition. We had bumped into each other before in the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up, two doors down. I was just walking absent - mindedly, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, and I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad at each other as well. We both just laughed for a while, laughing about how we did the same thing, but in the opposite way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone can help you tell if you'll be good friends or not. Laughter is a really big"
110	20852	8	3	"Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some @MONTH1 say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching @DATE1 day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to @CAPS1 we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; @CAPS4 was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know @CAPS4 was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where @CAPS4 means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after @CAPS4 strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. @CAPS4 grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, ""@CAPS1 you guys like have a problem or something?"" @CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, ""@CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty."" @CAPS4 believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I @CAPS1 not know for sure if @CAPS4 did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate."
111	20853	8	3	"DAIRY @CAPS1 My boyfriend and I spend a lot of quality time hanging out together. @CAPS2 As it happened, two days ago @PERSON3 and I had just gotten into an argument. His mom had just lovingly finished making a delicious meal. He was eager for me to try it and see if I liked it. But before I ate any, @CAPS3 I asked him if he would eat some of it with me. ""Maybe just a little bit,"" he had said, getting up to grab a fork. I thought he was going to eat it with me, but it turned out that he just sat next to me, talking to @PERSON2 @CAPS2 about the fight he had just been in. I really didn't mind the fact that he wasn't eating with me. I continued eating, and I carefully separated the food by colors to make a face on my plate. It turned out looking pretty great. He looks over and says, ""What's that supposed to be?"" with a little smirk on his face. ""It's a face! ... see, the carrots are the nose, the shrimp are the eyes, the greens and noodles form the mouth and hair,"" I look up with a big smile. ""Wanna take a picture of my face on the plate?"" I say. ""Nope,"" he answers. ""@CAPS4 Well, okay then,"" I answer back. I mix up all the things again and continue eating my food. When I'm done, I get up, put the plate in the sink, go back to the table and sit down. @PERSON3 gets up, goes outside, brings more wood for the fireplace and starts lighting it. I go up and ask him if he's mad. He says yes. Now I'm sad. I say I'm sorry. We talked it over and it turned out that he was mad because I didn't let him take a picture of my food. After five minutes, we're happy again. @PERSON1 suggests that we go to @CAPS5. We all agreed. When we got there, we all ordered our food and waited. ""Let's go to the wrestling mat!?"" we all said at the exact time. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 stayed waiting for the order while @PERSON3 and I went to play in the little kid toys. We were fighting our way in to the wrestling mat when we noticed that all the little kids were staring at us like they had never seen older kids play. We continued our little game of kicking, punching, slapping and scratching each other. I decided that I need a time out, so I sat up and took long breaths. Oh, out of nowhere I hear this weird noise. I look over and asked him if he had farted. He looked at me with a cheesy smile and after five seconds he replies yes. And continued farting. But the room seemed quiet, too quiet. We looked around to see that all the little boys and girls heard him too! There were two little girls standing at the entrance, a little boy a few feet away from @PERSON3 and two other little kids by the slide. I guess they were shocked. I started laughing to tears, ran out of the play room to go tell @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 what had just happened. They too thought that it was hilarious."
112	20856	8	3	@CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is truly a powerful tool when you know how to wield it effectively. It has the remarkable ability to inspire, especially when you're in a state of doubt. It can lift heavy spirits to new and exciting heights, and it can also create a great sense of devotion, whether it's to a person, a thing, or a noble cause. So, what has laughter done for you and me? Well, it has done a great deal for me. A prime example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2. At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3, I had everything going in my favor. I had excellent grades, wonderful teachers, but most importantly, a group of friends with whom I could share countless laughs. When we graduated and moved on to @ORGANIZATION3, my friends either moved away or dispersed into other social groups. It was truly horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things quite tough for me. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1. Since I wasn't really actively involved in the program, I didn't have many friends, except for Vanecek. Then an opportunity to join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 presented itself, and I eagerly took it. Every afternoon for one hour, we had practice, which, in turn, created a strong and lasting bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting, we would have a good laugh and relax, making it a fun and enjoyable environment to shoot in. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the well - deserved nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the hearty laughter that could be heard outside the shooting range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion is a part of, hosts five competitions every year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition, we had been together long enough to consider one another family. My family, noticing how nervous I was, took me aside the night before the shoot - out. We played cards, had engaging conversations, and cracked jokes. It was one of the most special and memorable times of my life. We shot early the next morning, and I wasn't nervous at all; I was just relaxed. Out of twenty - four man teams, we took third place. Not bad for a newly formed family. Since then, the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first place four times in a row. Those victories, I have to give full credit to the simple yet powerful human emotion of laughter. Laughter, in a way, has inspired me to devote myself to this amazing family and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you a part of?
113	20857	8	3	"Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door was enough to make me burst into laughter. It was the @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade year of school. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. Whenever we got bored, we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood to "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 "" some houses to have some fun. "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 "" means quietly sneak up to someone's front door, ring the doorbell a couple of times, and then quickly run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a truly great @DATE1 day, with a gorgeous sun shining brightly, a warm temperature, and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face. When it came to nightfall, we were all in @CAPS15 room playing @CAPS7 @NUM2. ""I'm bored bro,"" @PERSON2 said to the other three of us. ""@CAPS8 Well then, think of something to do,"" @CAPS9 replied. ""I can't think of anything,"" @PERSON1 stated with a clearly bored look on his face. We sat for a while, deep in thought, trying to come up with something to do to entertain the four of us. ""I got it!"" I said with a confident smirk, ""let's go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!"" ""I'm down for that,"" @PERSON2 said. ""@CAPS13 Me too,"" @CAPS9 and @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2. As we were walking out @CAPS15 front door, @CAPS15 mom shouted, ""where are you boys going?"" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say. ""Uh, we are going on a walk,"" I replied hesitantly. ""@CAPS16 Be safe,"" @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 "" ditched a couple of houses, but that was starting to get boring. And then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I've thought of yet. ""@CAPS18 This is what needs to happen. I'm going to "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 "" the first house, @PERSON2 will get the next one, @PERSON1 will get the house at the corner, and @PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house. ""@CAPS19 Do you think that will work?"" @PERSON1 asked. ""@CAPS20 Yes, it will work!"" I said, ""@CAPS21 Are you ready?"" ""I guess so,"" @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 said yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first doorbell and started running. Then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door. Next, I didn't see @PERSON1 ring the doorbell because he was already running ahead of me. ""@CAPS9 Get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have its porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed to see the step - up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step - up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street. He got up quickly and turned to us in confusion, ""Should I ring the doorbell? Should I ring it?"" ""@CAPS23 Run, @CAPS9! I'm sure they would hear you smack their screen door with your face!"" When we got back to @CAPS15 house, everyone was laughing. @CAPS9's mishap really made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago, and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends asks you to "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 "" a house, think about if the porch lights are on."
114	20859	8	3	"@CAPS1 Ma, do you know where my purse is?"" I wondered where it was because I needed to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and finally found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me. I was glad I found it before something went wrong. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and thought it would be just another ordinary day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season. We were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by extremely slowly. I couldn't wait for it to end. Finally, the bell rang, and school was over. I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me. If they didn't go, I probably wouldn't either. But I was determined. I texted them at five o'clock and managed to convince them it would be a lot of fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2. This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away. I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car, and it doesn't start all the time. It just sits there for a while until it decides it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we knew staring at us. We just started laughing. It was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else, and I said no. My car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dying. Out of all the other days, my car decided not to start today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car. I got so embarrassed and started laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more. I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did. I was so relieved and embarrassed. I left as soon as I could. Twenty minutes later, we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, there were no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was within walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet, but it was about to. I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began, and just as I figured, the game kept going back and forth. We got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting, but there were two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at the players, shouting at the referee, and just being really annoying. The game was good, but in the end, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team. After the game, we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I knew, but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON"
115	20860	8	3	Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear.
116	20861	8	3	"Laughter has always played a significant role in the relationships of my life. Being able to laugh with someone creates a strong and genuine bond with that person. Through laughter, I was able to become friends with a person that I can call to this day my best friend. I met the person that would later on become my best friend through one of my friends. A few friends of mine and I were hanging out casually and my friend, @PERSON1, said, ""You know @PERSON2, you should talk to a good friend of mine."" I didn't oppose to the idea because from what @PERSON1 told me about her, it seemed like it would be very easy for me to get along with her. About ten minutes later, I looked down at my cell phone and noticed that I had a text message from a number that I did not know. I asked who the person was and patiently waited for a response. Two minutes pass by and I get a message that says, ""My name is @ORGANIZATION2. I am the girl the curly - headed kid sitting next to you told you about."" Once I read this I started just about busted up into a fit of hearty laughter. Never would I have thought a girl I had never spoken to would be brave enough, or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing they would say to me. For the next few hours, we kept exchanging sarcastic remarks and jokes and the laughs just kept on coming non - stop. @ORGANIZATION2 is the type of person that can make anyone laugh. This is what I love about her; she possesses a fantastic talent of making anyone laugh no matter where they are, what kind of mood they are in, or what they are doing. We have walked around for hours and we have spent a majority of that time having to stop and catch our breath because we had been laughing so hard. Our ability to laugh with each other has helped us through difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATION2's mom passed away a few years ago and this sent her into a deep depressive state. She rarely felt any happiness until we would talk. Our ability to start laughing at one another helped her throughout this time. I recently received a @CAPS4.B.I. or @ORGANIZATION1. I felt numb to the world. Nothing felt the way that it once felt. Luckily for me, @ORGANIZATION2 was able to come in and do what I had done for her; she was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. Having the ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION2 has definitely made our friendship stronger than it would have been had we not been able to laugh together. Being able to laugh doesn't just affect that one moment in time, nor does it just impact one person. Having laughter means so much more than that. Being able to laugh creates bonds that are simply not possible without laughter. I have felt what laughter can do to a relationship and I can say that it most definitely feels good."
117	20862	8	3	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" My best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think we're weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, ""I'm going to die laughing."" Well, I know I am because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together, I couldn't; there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times. First of all, this friendship started the @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore @DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the absolute best of friends. So last @DATE1 when we were learning the cheers for football season, almost every - time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3 - in @CAPS4."" That was our special saying, and we always did it before and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3 - in @CAPS4 style or for short our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours on end. ""@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn,"" In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every - time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a funny motion with it. Oh my goodness we laughed and we had a really great time. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like silly monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed uncontrollably. We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really embarrassing. That was one of many car rides that was amazing. On the other hand, @PERSON1 and I, cheer together, we have sleepovers, well, I should say that we do everything together. She is my cheer sister and will always be, also she is my best friend. I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1. In addition, we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at my house I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so I went and made all of that and @PERSON1 loved it so now I have to make sure I have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the beginning of the sandwich habit and we laugh about it all the time. Finally, @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because I don't know what I would do without my sister. I would not be the person who I am today without her she means everything to me. We laugh even when we want to cry. She is everything to me. You could say we have a perfect friendship of all time. My best friend is my sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks for always having my back."

119	20865	8	3	It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day I decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and I'd almost fall over. It was quite comical. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in the fun of the story - telling. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or I would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. It was like being on a mini - ice rink. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we were going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying having to answer every few minutes. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school. We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go too close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle I had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats. I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy. But overall, it was a day full of laughter and unexpected adventures.
120	20866	8	3	It was one of those days where I just sat around all day doing nothing, but play @PERSON2, text, and laugh at myself. It was one of those days where no one bothered me; no
121	20869	8	3	"A day with the family One sunny day, my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad, and I decided to go out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for a delicious breakfast. They had all grown up together in the same neighborhood, and as they sat around the table, telling stories about the old days, it made them all eager to hang out more often. They always had so much fun together, reminiscing about their childhood escapades. I grew up with my cousins around a great deal of the time. We would always hang out at each other's houses, playing games and having a blast. As we sat there, we started talking about all the crazy times we had shared, and it was truly nice to hear about those long - gone days. We were just laughing up a storm, enjoying each other's company.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, my cousin @PERSON1 let out a loud fart. All of us immediately started busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continued to fart while she was uncontrollably laughing, her face turning red from the effort. So many people were looking at us in the restaurant, probably wondering what on earth was so funny. Here was a group of people all laughing hysterically, and one of them couldn't stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting, creating quite a ruckus. My mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table, hoping to drown out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red with embarrassment. We were all laughing so hard that we started crying. We were almost to the point where we were going to pee ourselves.  @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee so bad that she could not even walk properly. When she got up to go to the bathroom, she had to walk there cross - legged and very slowly. All the way there, she was still laughing, and we were also laughing at her funny gait. We had fun watching her have to stop every so often so that she would not pee on herself. One time that she had to stop, it was right on these two guys' chairs. She just stood there laughing cross - legged over these two guys, trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything; they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom, ""I would be uncomfortable too if I had some random girl bent over me laughing and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. I would have.""  Finally, @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out, she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her, we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us, so we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go, so we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play board games.  When we got home, my brother joined us in a game of gestures. This game is kinda like charades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brother's team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground in a very exaggerated way. I shout out, ""Wicked witch of the west!"" He frowns at me and says, ""Hey, watch before you shout things out."" So I sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again, but when he got to the floor, he started rolling and jerking around. I was so confused. My cousin shouts out, ""Poop!"" My brother yells, ""No, why would anyone want to be poop!"" We all start laughing, and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and I got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making a sound. I went up there and started hopping around like an idiot. I felt so dumb. My team - mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what I was for the life of them. The buzzer rang, and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad and ran up the stairs. On his way up there, he trips on his face and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time and stayed in his room the rest of the day.  The rest of us stayed downstairs and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hang out with the family and get a great laugh. Hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good."
122	20870	8	3	"Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier, and even helps you live longer. It's also very important in relationships. When talking about preferences in significant others, it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, and this is the reason. This story, however, is not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known @PERSON1 for a few months at this point. I had met him on the bus during my daily commute. He was pale, skinny, and very loud. He always had something funny and offensive to say, and he was a bit of a shut - in, spending most of his free time indoors. Before I met @PERSON1, I could dish out jokes but couldn't take it when others made fun of me.  I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him. We were having a heated argument about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other people's expense but would get up in someone's face if they tried one at me."" This made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right, but because it made me realize that @PERSON1 was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up.  Throughout the whole time I have known @PERSON1, he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything, from stepping in dog crap to dealing with his father's drug addiction. He can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. @PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stop laughing, as laughter can truly change perspectives and bring people closer."
123	20871	8	3	Laughter is good for everyone. It helps the body be more awake. In fact, believe it or not, laughter is an exercise for the body. When you laugh, your facial muscles move, your diaphragm contracts, and your heart rate increases, all of which are signs of a mini - workout. Laughter clears the body when people are really stressed out. It's like a natural release valve, allowing pent - up tension to escape. It is not just good for you but also, when others see you laughing, it also gives another person courage to do the same. A shared laugh can create a positive atmosphere and make a difficult situation seem more bearable. Laughter truly has the power to uplift spirits and bring people together, making it an essential part of a healthy and happy life.
124	20872	8	3	"Laughter is a powerful medicine. We have all been there, I know we have. We all have. We have all been that kid that just did not feel like helping your nagging parent out. Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and you had been waiting on him hand and foot the entire visit at the hospital. Your dad had gone through a couple of surgeries and was put on a lot of medications for his injuries. I had noticed that your dad was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about your step - mother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also the stress of having your father's business being the main income, and him not being able to work. Your father felt helpless; his leg was too weak for him to be doing anything. He would micromanage everything and tell you that you were doing things all wrong. This was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (your little sister) and I were left alone with your dad for the first time. I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in your room. Father asked if I could make him some oatmeal. Of course, with full hands, I said, ""Sure, but I will when I'm done."" Your father took that as disrespect and hobbled over to me with his crutches. He was yelling at me, which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back, I headed to your room. The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to your room.  That's when it happened. Your father hooked the end of a little kids' chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting your knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door, luckily I had the phone, and I called your grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted your sister and me, telling us it would be okay.  Your grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then, your dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. He used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then he started making fun and telling jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreement, your dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after he told some jokes, he apologized again. This time, explaining why he was sorry. I liked that, which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  ""Doctors say that laughter is a powerful medicine. Ten minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of relaxation."" A health expert on a radio service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The stress that you and your sister went through that day was all over after the laughter your father gave us. ""Laughter can save us,"" he also stated. After this day, I believe with a little humor, your father and my relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a lifetime bond. Laughter will always be in our hearts, helping us overcome difficult times."
125	20874	8	3	"Laughter plays an important role in relationships. It also supports enjoyment and can be a pursuit of happiness. Whenever I am laughing, it's either because I am really enjoying myself or I'm just having a great time. Many people don't have a very good sense of humor and don't laugh at things that are funny. Whenever I watch a funny movie that I like, I sit down and wait for the very funny parts. But don't get me wrong, remember not to laugh too hard because you might wet your pants by accident. Or who knows, if you laugh hard enough, you might even pull a ""whotammy"" (whatever that is!), and trust me, that does not look pretty, and then you will be embarrassed in front of everybody.  My favorite comedian is Adam Sandler because he is very funny and has a good sense of humor. He knows how to keep a person laughing and interested in his comedy shows and movies. When he made the ""Big Daddy"" movie, it was pretty good. It wasn't extremely funny but still had its moments. My second - favorite comedian is @PERSON1 because he is funnier than Adam Sandler by a little bit, but not quite as polished. He also stars on a TV show called ""Wild 'n Out."" That show really makes me almost cough out my lungs, especially when they bust out with ""your mama"" jokes. It keeps you laughing and keeps the blood pumping through your body.  So we all pretty much understand what laughing is, but most people don't really seem to laugh at things that are funny. I can't quite understand it, but my guess is that they don't have a good sense of humor. But some people seem to laugh at things that don't even make sense. I quite don't understand that either, but I guess it's better to laugh than to not laugh at all.  Some really good comedy movies that I can mention right off the bat that will keep you tuned and laughing through more than half of the movies are ""Grandma's Boy,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Sipping My Juice,"" and ""Zombieland."" ""Zombieland"" is a heck of a good movie. It's not just about making a funny movie just to make the audience laugh. It's the way they make it, how they act, and how good the background story to the comedy movies is gonna be. That's what I pay attention to whenever I sit down and inspect what makes the movie funny. Also, if I can't understand a funny movie, I watch it again and again till I understand what is so hilarious about it.  That pretty much covers the basics on laughter. There is your basic information about what it is and how to enjoy it and use it wisely. Remember, don't laugh too hard because you don't want to end up pulling a ""whotammy"" in front of everyone around. Thank you for reading my text."
126	20876	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful force that can heal the body and soothe the soul. It acts as a cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebody's pain, offering comfort and relief in difficult times. Laughter has the remarkable ability to mend a friendship, turning two strangers into the best of friends. A person can simply ask anybody on the street about the importance of laughter in life, and they would undoubtedly say that laughter is very important. It's like love, something that everyone needs a little of in their life. Just like love, laughter helps a person grow and become a well - rounded adult.  A person can use laughter as a valuable tool in various aspects of life, such as getting a job, trying to win the heart of a girl, or simply having a good time and making new friends. It's one of the main elements of life that shapes a person's character and influences their actions.  In the @DATE1, I was introduced to a girl named @DATE3, by my cousin @PERSON1. She started talking to me, and I was shy because she was a girl, and I wasn't used to having conversations with girls. But then, I cracked a joke, and that made her and I laugh together. That shared laughter was the first icebreaker, paving the way for us to become friends.  As the days went by, we were text - messaging each other every day over the phone. We made jokes about how our day was and even made light - hearted jokes about each other. Eventually, we started talking to each other over the phone. Teens these days usually don't use the phone to call people, and this makes it hard to understand emotions because talking over text hides the true feelings from one another.  @DATE3 called me, and we would talk to each other until late in the @TIME1. Sometimes, we would both fall asleep with the phone on. And throughout our conversations, we would always be making jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school. Making her happy was what I needed to do, and one of the ways to achieve that was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentleman, as I was raised to be.  @DATE2 formal was coming near, and I was in need of a date. @DATE3 was my best option for a date since I was getting close to her, and I was starting to get attached to her. When I had the chance, I asked her to be my date for the @DATE2 formal, which would be one of the most special nights of my freshman year.  The day of the formal finally came, and we danced the @TIME1 away. Of course, I had to make a few jokes about other things, which made everyone laugh and have a great time. Near the end of the dance, I gathered the courage to ask her to be my girlfriend, and she accepted. She said I was funny, nice, and cute, which was really good. We had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the @TIME1 alive.  The next @DATE2 formal, the same thing happened with a different girl. Laughter was an important key, and it made the @TIME1 so much fun. That @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life that I had ever had because we were laughing and having the best @TIME1 ever.  Laughter is an important key in my life. I would have never gotten the girl or had the best @TIME1 of my life if laughter was never involved. Laughter makes everything better, and I use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh when they are in a bad mood. Without laughter, my life would be dull and lack the color that makes me who I am today. It's one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it, you would be less happy than you are right now. A small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humor. Everybody needs personality and color in their life, and without it, everything is grey. Life is like a coloring book, and without someone or something to color it in, it's just useless. So, keep laughing and embrace the joy it brings.
127	20877	8	3	"I have had numerous great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man, always ready with a joke or a kind word. When my cousin, my grandpa, and I get together for a camping trip, there is always some kind of trouble brewing, no matter what.  A few years ago, he took me and my cousin on a two - day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites, so we had to move on to the next one. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites, so we carefully picked the best one we could find and settled in for the first @TIME1.  Later that evening, we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there had been a raccoon problem a few days before, and people were scared to stay there, fearing an attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky; we never saw the raccoon, and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME2, on the way out, we saw a sign that read ""caution raccoon problem."" @CAPS1's comments and antics made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1, we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1.  While at the gas station, we had a little bit of an issue, but it was extremely funny. A young blond woman came out to help us, and she wasn't the smartest person I have ever met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we actually bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa was rolling up his window, he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"" while the woman was standing right there. She didn't say a word, and my grandpa drove off with me and my cousin laughing so hard that we could barely breathe. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what had happened when he said ""dumb blonde."" He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What made it even better was that he drove off like nothing had happened.  The next @TIME1, we stayed at a different campground with no raccoons. Still, the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. After our dinner, we were roasting marshmallows over the fire. For some odd reason, my grandpa could not keep the marshmallow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmallows before he even got one that he could eat. And every time he dropped one into the fire, it got more and more hilarious. We laughed and laughed until our stomachs hurt. The best part was that my grandpa didn't think it was funny, so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something.  In the tent that @TIME1, we were so tired that everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. That's when everything went silent, and we couldn't last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds.  My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years, and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we grow closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man, and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always kept me laughing, and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have fun in all you do, as laughter truly makes life more enjoyable."
128	20878	8	3	"Laughter"" - I firmly believe that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get a bit fuzzy, making them laugh will always help break the ice.  When I get angry with my boyfriend, he knows that in order for me to be happy, he must make me smile or laugh. That is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry was on @DATE1 @CAPS1, and we had just started dating. I remember he asked me if I was hungry, and I said ""no, I'm not hungry."" But he continued to ask. Since we had only been dating for a short period of time, he really didn't know much about me. He didn't know that I am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and has a really low temper. He continued to ask me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired, but he didn't realize that at this point, I was really annoyed. An hour and a half passed by, and he was still asking! I was going crazy, but I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad.  But then I thought to myself and said, ""no, he has to know because it's going to be worse if later on in the relationship he has to find out what I like and don't like on his own rather than me telling him."" I went on and told him every single little detail about me, both good and bad. At first, he just listened, but towards the end, he exploded and told me that it was wrong of me not to be straight - up with him from the beginning. That made me really upset. I was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened, but I guess it didn't go as planned.  I stayed quiet for the longest time, and he kept asking me ""what's wrong,"" ""tell me what I did wrong."" So I told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no real reason. All I was trying to do was save us from a larger argument. He looked at me and told me that I did do something wrong! He said that we had already been together for two months, and it took me that long to show him my true colors. I kind of understood where he was coming from, but at the same time, I didn't agree because by that point, he should have already known. I mean, it doesn't take that long to know a person, especially if it's your girlfriend.  In the end, we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. Then, he busted out saying ""ouch charlie you bit me"" in a @CAPS2 accent. That just made me lose it. I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about the overwhelming discussion we had.  The point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when things get tough. And it doesn't necessarily have to be a loved one; it can even be a complete stranger. If the person is shy, making them laugh will help build a great friendship. You can make anybody's day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face. A simple ""hello"" or ""hey"" can even make them smile.  I believe that a person that smiles often lives longer. This @MONTH1 may not be true, but in my little world, it is. I am all about smiling and making people laugh. Honestly, I hate seeing people walk around with angry faces, as if they have no friends, when all they really want is someone to make them smile - and that would be me!  In conclusion, if it wasn't for laughter, what relationship would still be standing at this point? None, because if you're always arguing and always whining and never laughing, then how do you expect your relationship to last? Like I said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and it truly has the power to strengthen bonds and bring joy to our lives."
129	20879	8	3	Angelina @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a year ago, some time in the @DATE2, I was at my best friend @PERSON1's house for a sleepover after her @CAPS3 party. We were exhausted from swimming at her @CAPS4's pool and taking her dog for a walk, not to mention all the partying. We would have been asleep if it weren't for the family - sized bag of @CAPS5 and six - pack of @ORGANIZATION1 we'd consumed not an hour before.  At around three in the @TIME1, our childish minds were searching for something to do. We decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in hopes of them glowing in the dark when held to the black light on her windowsill. I was the first one daring enough to touch my tongue to the brush, and boy did it hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds like crazy.  The next day was @DATE1, and after hanging out at @LOCATION1's house for the afternoon, we came to my house for another sleepover, which is what we do and sometimes still do every time we are together.  That night, this time around two in the @TIME1, we grew hungry again and came downstairs to get a snack before retreating back to my room. @PERSON1 played on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush. @PERSON1 got jars of ice water; I still don't know why she uses jars instead of cups. She interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a random instantaneous ice - chugging contest.  After ten seconds of silence, I glanced over my jar at @LOCATION1, who wasn't even half done with her water. There, on her chin, was a speck, a dot, a glob, of blue nail polish. I attempted a gasp to give me enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air coming into my windpipe, an ice cube made its way in. Choking, laughing
130	20881	8	3	"Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS4 asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells ""@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!"" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her ""@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself"" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 was @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her ""hideous monster"". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON2, we all went back to the car where @PERSON3 was waiting @PERSON2 we left. Ever since that night @PERSON2, @PERSON2 @PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think about @CAPS5 we all start laughing @PERSON2 making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag."
131	20882	8	3	"For me, laughter is the invisible force that makes the world go round. It is an essential element, much needed to keep the world light - hearted and filled with a strong sense of happiness. You will hardly ever come across me without a big, old - fashioned smile plastered across my face. There are so many stories to choose from, but that particular @TIME1 one will be the most fun to tell, I think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that @TIME1. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @PERSON1, down to @LOCATION1 for the Fourth of @DATE1. They have a big Fourth of @DATE1 parade and I was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We were staying with good friends of his mom, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Their house was stunningly amazing, with beautiful wood floors, a big open living room that seamlessly combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big, stunning window that framed the crisp @CAPS3. @CAPS4. Even with the house being so great, my favorite part was the railroad tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded with woods were two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions as far as the eye could see. My favorite part of the whole trip was those tracks. It was the second @TIME1 of our stay in @LOCATION1 around @NUM1 o'clock. @PERSON1 and I went for a walk in the refreshing @TIME1. We could hardly see and were holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling, we finally stumbled out of the very well - hidden trail entrance onto the tracks. Hand in hand, we started to walk down the tracks, just enjoying each other's presence. In @CAPS4, the stars are the most stunning I have ever seen. I'm not sure why, but the sky just seems to open up and look two times bigger than it really is. That @TIME1 was perfect for star - gazing with not a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good @NUM2 minutes. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression then I followed his gaze to see what had aroused him. Far in the distance was a light. Slowly advancing towards us. Sure - a - nuff, it was a train at @NUM1 o'clock at @TIME1. Looking back at each other, we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at @TIME1. As the train advanced, we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot. The train was going way slower than I was expecting. No more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 miles per hour. @PERSON1's eyes lit up with an idea and not thinking, he said ""We should jump it!"" As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed towards the track, telling him to live a little and let's have some fun. I had never jumped a train before, but from the looks of it, that @TIME1 train was perfect to try it out on. There were long flat - bed cars with handy little ladders on each one. I grabbed for one and jumped on right before @PERSON1 could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We were both smiling and having a great @TIME1 when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming our way. Freaking out, for sure thinking we would get in trouble, I sprinted for the trail head with @PERSON1 close on my heels. I could not find the trail and the light was getting closer, so we both jumped full - speed straight into a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still till the light passed us and the train began to resume its pace. I met @PERSON1's big fat smile and we both just rolled over laughing, not being able to help ourselves. What were the chances of going out for a simple walk and all that @TIME1 happening. Still smiling hugely, @PERSON1 leaned over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. That @TIME1 is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of @PERSON1's and I in our relationship. Love, friends, and laughter is the reason life is worth living."
132	20883	8	3	"Being able to laugh is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is truly priceless. Family moments like that are times that no one can ever take away. They will always be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days when you need a bit of cheer. Not being able to laugh would make this world a dull and extremely depressing place. Laughter is the main connection that binds family and friends together. My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break, we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us knew how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So, on the day we were released from school, my mom packed us up in the car and off we went. After two long hours of driving, we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge, with people pushing and shoving a bit. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up the stairs to see where we were at. There it was, @LOCATION2 in the distance. Once we got off the boat and through the crowded highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border, I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she knew what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving, my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map, we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived, my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up, my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were supposed to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she knew what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip, we drove around laughing and telling my mom, ""Don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them."" Laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment. Being able to laugh is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull. Being with family and taking a negative situation, and turning it into the best vacation ever with laughter is truly priceless. Everybody needs to laugh in their life, because you only live once so make it worth while."
133	20884	8	3	Laughter brings the world together in a way that simply cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is formed that is truly unique. There is no way to accurately describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the wonderful bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed out loud. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh, I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie - dye t - shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a really good time and enjoying the warm night air. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE1. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie - dye t - shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie - dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them, so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour car ride, we slept, laughed, and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story - telling. We each came from different cities, schools, and backgrounds, which made for a very entertaining car ride. At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals, and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roommates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other. Laughter is what brought @PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making others laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one.
134	20885	8	3	Humor is a huge part of who I am, and I love making people laugh. But this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousin's house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt, like a scraped knee or a bruised elbow, and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while. But they would always cave in and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our lifetime. It all started out at my aunt's birthday party. Usually, she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year. This year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all showed up for my aunt's party, my mom, my brothers, and me. First off, we did all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, shaking hands and giving hugs, eating some delicious food, and singing happy birthday. Basically, in my eyes, it was all the boring stuff. I mean, come on, there was a trampoline out in the backyard just waiting to be jumped on, but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had eaten. Finally, everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline, but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an event that was about to transpire.
135	20887	8	3	It was a normal day. I had just woken up because my friend @PERSON2 called me wondering if I wanted to hang out. I said yes and I quickly went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready, I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hang out at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to Kyle's house and play basketball. When I got there, everyone was over there, so we decided to have a big game of basketball. I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took, I missed. It was really embarrassing, with the ball bouncing off the rim or going wide. But my team ended up winning, which was no surprise. After the game, we all were tired and went inside
136	20888	8	3	@CAPS1 is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore, it @CAPS1 makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. It @CAPS1 is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each other's company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond it @CAPS1 forms. Picture the scene: It @CAPS1 was a sunny @DATE2 on the north side of @CAPS2, below the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven - year - old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. The boy was extremely tired; he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The bright @DATE1 sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. It @CAPS1 was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy, adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well, leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting one foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going, with no avail. He tried another tack; he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in the hope that it @CAPS1 would take the boy's mind off the excruciating pain. And to the relief of all concerned, it @CAPS1 proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is that it @CAPS1 wasn't the content of the stories that helped; it @CAPS1 was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference. An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor, I found the strength to keep going. It @CAPS1 was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and legs, which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead, lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels was silenced. This was all due to someone's thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature, the emotional element that keeps the world sane. It @CAPS1 was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had an indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity in each other's comments. It @CAPS1 forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose, he always manages to find a way to bring a smile to my face, and I found that I too had the same ability. To my belief, a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship, respect, and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. It @CAPS1 is the drug that descends from the heavens, a drug that runs through the bloodstream of society, in the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also begun to laugh? Then your eyes lock, and a slow smile spreads throughout both of your faces as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter.
137	20889	8	3	"Laughing, smirking, giggling, and @CAPS1 chuckling; these all have to do with one subject, and that @CAPS1 is, laughing. Laughter is everywhere; you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back. It @CAPS1 can be a great thing or a horrible thing in @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS1 even with family and @CAPS1 friends. Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever. It was the start of a brand new @ORGANIZATION1. I had just moved from @LOCATION2. I was a seventh - grader about to start at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1. I @CAPS1 wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people, so I stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books were without talking to anybody. My schedule was good; I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art and @CAPS1 drama were a blast, but when it came to choir and @CAPS1 singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people. Then one day, I was walking to choir, and @CAPS1 I tripped and @CAPS1 fell, my papers falling with me. My @ORGANIZATION1 work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by and @CAPS1 said I did a great job, but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework and @CAPS1 picked up my schedule and @CAPS1 saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was @PERSON1, she told me, and @CAPS1 I told her my name, and @CAPS1 we walked together. We sat next to each other, and @CAPS1 I sang with her, our voices in harmony. We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends, and @CAPS1 the principal thought so too. He went ahead and @CAPS1 gave us classes together. We were friends, and @CAPS1 we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is that she moved at the near end of eighth - grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while, and @CAPS1 I always give her a call every now and @CAPS1 then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing and @CAPS1 talking about how we are doing and @CAPS1 when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now, and @CAPS1 it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, and @CAPS1 one little laugh from an amazing person. Laughing has got me so far in life and @CAPS1 at @ORGANIZATION1. Every now and @CAPS1 then, when I see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I go and @CAPS1 talk to them, and @CAPS1 even laugh with them. One little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it does. Some say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" And @CAPS1 I believe whoever said that because it happened to me."
138	20892	8	3	"When it comes down to laughter, it can change a person's thinking or even the mood that they @CAPS4 are in. Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to strengthen the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy. I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with a sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down. My @CAPS2 older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces an aunt could ever have. When they @CAPS4 were little babies, I used to make silly faces, dance to @PERSON1, and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I proceeded with my @CAPS2 day and began to watch music videos. When ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"", by @ORGANIZATION1 came on. They @CAPS4 went crazy! They @CAPS4 started jumping on the bed and twirling their @CAPS3 back and forth as if they @CAPS4 were @ORGANIZATION1! They @CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe before my @CAPS2 eyes that this was happening, and I bursted out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy that I had to get up and dance with them. We jumped, we twirled, and whipped our @CAPS3 several times before the song ended, with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun with the music video, they @CAPS4 just kept dancing, and in my @CAPS2 head I'm like, ""Don't they @CAPS4 ever get tired?"" But I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continuous amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless. My @CAPS2 nieces really and truly are what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet; let's just call it bittersweet. It was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my nieces. It was their ability to find joy in the simplest things and spread that joy through laughter. My @CAPS2 nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, lets just called it bittersweet. I feel like @CAPS2 nieces knew that I would be sad so they @CAPS4 would say ""@CAPS5, what's wrong"", @CAPS5 being my @CAPS2 nickname because I am very short. They @CAPS4 would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and my @CAPS2 nieces' relationship has grown to the highest extent, and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", then they @CAPS4 are correct because I might @MONTH1 be in a different country, state, or any other area, but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics, and the closer we become as one. Laughter is indeed a powerful force that can brighten even the darkest days and strengthen the bonds between loved ones."
139	20893	8	3	"Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you might @MONTH1 be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end, you're all laughing together, no matter who they are. When you see something happen that's really funny, you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous, all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways of showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, you're always in my head, I want you in my bed...."" That's supposed to be a love poem. When you're in a relationship with someone, you might think you're in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover and then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example, my friend and I were invited to a birthday party. She had lots of fun games and lots of delicious food. My friend that went with me to the party, her name is @PERSON1. It was getting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything; this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See, for some reason, we do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friend's house that we just didn't want the night to end at all. We all sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hours earlier, watching ""@CAPS2 A"". Then, out of the blue, I started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day, I don't know why I was laughing at her. All of a sudden, she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe anymore. So I got up and walked myself to the bathroom, but I could still hear her @CAPS3 laughter in the room, which was still making me laugh. Since that night, @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a significant part of"
140	20894	8	3	"As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile."
141	20895	8	3	"Just casually walking through the local mall in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We were trying to find the best costumes for a Halloween party. When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. Banana escapade is just one example of the crazy things my friend Sarah and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both Sarah and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at the City Gymnastics Club. We worked out at the gym every day for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At the City Gymnastics Club, Sarah and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. Banana escapade meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the warm summer sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter Sarah and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, last summer we were at Emily's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, Sarah and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Banana escapade is how Sarah and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times."
142	20896	8	3	"Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship."" Many other people firmly believe that laughter is an essential and significant part of any relationship. I also whole - heartedly agree with those thoughts.  I came to New York about two years ago. At that time, I did not speak English at all. I started going to school. I carefully practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I went to school. The next day I walked into school and I could clearly see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  ""Hi, my name is Lily,"" the girl said with a warm smile. ""Hi, my name is Mia. I'm from Japan. I don't really speak English,"" I said to Lily, then Lily started laughing so hard, her eyes crinkling with amusement. ""Oh - oh you have an accent,"" Lily said, ""it's really cute."" I laughed back, feeling a bit more at ease. Lily looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first American friend ever.  I always thought that making new friends was hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be. Laughter truly has the power to break down barriers and build new connections, making relationships more fulfilling and enjoyable."
143	20897	8	3	Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is also the most effective way to relax. Everyone often says that hearing a baby laugh is an absolute delight. Watching comedians performing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing heartily. Laughter is the best way to relax and here are three reasons for that. First, no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. When someone is laughing, the negative emotions just seem to melt away. Second, when someone laughs, everyone around that person starts laughing too. It's like a contagious wave of joy. Third and last reason, no one can stay sad when something funny is happening. The power of humor can quickly turn a gloomy mood around. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think that the baby is truly loved by its family. He or she is having a blast playing with someone in the family or even by themselves. They think that whatever you are doing is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is stand - up comedy. That is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act, using their wit and charm to entertain the audience. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a TV show, a play, or a movie. Comedies usually do not have a complex plot, but the point is to make you and anyone else start laughing. That is what I think about laughter. It helps anyone relax. Hearing a baby's laugh is great. Comedians love to hear people laugh at or with them. Laughter truly is a universal language that brings people together and lightens up our lives.
144	20898	8	3	"The incident only happened a few weeks ago on a day when all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands firmly over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head slowly rose up, the tears seemed to eat away at the self - sturdiness of his normal self, and he spoke to the person who always sat to his left. "" They just don't understand, Mark"" the broken, voice cracked on words ""I don't care that they play in cascade winds or that they get private lessons or that they've gone to state honor band! This might sound like a terrible reason, but I just want to play first because I want to play first, and they never let us play first."" He was right about one thing, Mark really never let us play first. I somehow understood where he was coming from; back in my freshman year I had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short, his four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turning into mediocrity in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  The prodigy, Lisa, was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove it. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to Paris as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe it was my sense of wanting superiority as well. Lisa took in the words, leaned closer to say. "" I understand that you want first"" with confident tones she said ""but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are what's needed on first part. I understand what you're feeling, I've been there before.""  It struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what he was feeling? She'd been a prodigy child in band from the start. I sided with him but then I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So I tried siding with Lisa but then all I could think about was that this was his last year to shine as a high - school french horn player. They kept going at each other. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. If the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co - operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. ""If a man has no socks,"" I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "" then so will..."" And that's as far as I got. I thought it was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled as they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully I was oblivious of the stuff they called me because I really wanted to remember what I wanted to say. He stopped crying, finally, and Lisa got my message that he was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in high - school band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; he would get first chair as soon as we stopped competing. After that, I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as it gets sometimes it's usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I can't even begin to imagine what band would be like if their enmity had risen to the no - forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so high that it made it hard to breathe right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip each other's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other if they were to continue fighting. Either way, this incident has definitely changed the way they feel about each other; I haven't heard them complain about one another for a while. He is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and Lisa for better or worse can't wait to see him play."
145	20899	8	3	"We're happy together, Tom told me as we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. He always made me feel so great. He made me feel beautiful. Now don't say you're too young to know what love is, I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's a lot of fun. Most guys I have been with have not been this much fun, especially in our dates together, like walking to the park to sit and talk, or eating out and then kissing in public. Before we were ever dating, we were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us if we were dating, The answer was always no, we're best friends, but I always wanted more. We wouldn't have made such a strong couple if we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about the moment I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my math class, and out of nowhere Tom grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said ""Hey, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants"" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my math class I was thinking to myself why could he just say that to me, he must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what he did and why he did it made me feel, well it made me feel like he really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather than embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not Tom... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, he looked up and kissed me. I didn't know if that was a best - friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then he kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about Tom. Who knows what they were telling him. Even some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and Tom. I know he didn't believe anything they were saying because he would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When he laughed I would always ask him what's so funny, he would say ""If the rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know you're not bothered by them"" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying, they stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in college, let alone finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost as difficult. My brother went to prison last year, and I don't think I could have been able to make it through as much as I did without Tom. I cried almost every day at college with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what Tom said"
146	20900	8	3	"Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone truly understands the profound effect laughter can have on two people though. For example, there can be two complete strangers, who have never laid eyes on each other before in their entire lives; as soon as they start sharing hearty laughter, they could quickly become good friends. You'll never know how close you can become with someone if you don't ever take the time to sit down, have a genuine conversation, share some laughs, and really get to know them. You could go your whole life being at @CAPS4 with just a minute amount of friends, but then there could be @NUM1 other classmates you've never talked to that could also become your friends, too. I'm sure just getting to know one another would make a significant difference in someone's life because for me, there have been numerous situations where laughing has made a lasting impact on my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @PERSON1. When I first met my friend @PERSON1, we were total strangers to each other. But a simple laugh broke the ice. That initial laugh made us feel comfortable in each other's presence, and everything became less awkward. As soon as we started laughing more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. I went to elementary @CAPS4 with @PERSON1 for @NUM2 years and never exchanged a single word with her. But then when we got into @NUM3 grade, we started hanging out with the same group of people and began talking more. By @NUM4 grade, we began to hang out outside of @CAPS4, chatting, sharing secrets, and having sleepovers. But ""breaking the ice"" isn't the only impact laughing can have on a relationship. When I'm with @PERSON1, I know I can completely trust her, and every moment with her is filled with fun. We always have engaging conversations to talk and laugh about. You could say it made us grow closer. By the time @NUM5 grade came around, we were inseparable best friends. We had sleepovers every single weekend at one another's houses. When the @DATE1 before our @NUM6 grade year at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 arrived, we were spending weeks at each other's places. There wasn't a single day that went by that we weren't together, chatting, or making plans over the @DATE1 to hang out. Now, we can be our true selves around each other; we can always have a great time. Making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can have on two people. When I'm sad about something, @PERSON1 has a way of making everything better; also vice versa, I make her feel better, too. We always have each other's backs. I know we will always be there for each other; I'll always have a shoulder to cry on. We have become such close friends that when @PERSON1 was having problems at home and needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, she moved in with me! It has been an absolute blast living with her. We thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed with each other, but we haven't. @PERSON1 and I can hang out @NUM7 and always be in each other's company; it's like having another sister.  @PERSON1 and I are super close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 until we graduate. It's truly amazing to think that our being best friends, extremely close, living together, always being together, and being totally comfortable with each other on everything all started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the @NUM3 grade. This is why I firmly believe that just laughing can make two strangers, who have never even spoken, turn into being the closest of friends."
147	20901	8	3	"One @DATE1 @TIME1 back in @DATE2, a couple of friends and I were extremely bored. Nothing seemed remotely fun to do. Going to a movie, going to get some food, not even a call of @CAPS2 sounded entertaining. @LOCATION1's parents told us to go do something outside. Before leaving his house, he quietly slips into his pantry and grabs two hefty rolls of @CAPS11 wrap. ""I think I have an idea,"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 says as we walk away from his house. I have absolutely no clue where we're walking to. @PERSON1 just keeps repeating ""follow me."" We all follow in a tight - knit pack down the street until we show up at @ORGANIZATION1. Cold and utterly confused, we sit in the parking lot of the @ORGANIZATION1 waiting patiently for all cars to be gone. Once all the cars are finally gone, @PERSON1 informs us on what we are doing here. He tells us of something he did with his cousins awhile back. You have three people on the roof of @ORGANIZATION1's @ORGANIZATION1 scoping out the road, and you have four @CAPS4. ""@CAPS4?"" I question @PERSON1 with a dumb - founded look on my face. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS4,"" @CAPS6 @CAPS4 are the people who will be putting the @CAPS11 wrap across the street. The plan is when no cars are coming in the distance, we hop the fence and put @CAPS11 wrap across the street so cars drive through it and stop. ""@CAPS7 sounds fun, but uh what happens when the @CAPS15 stops before the @CAPS11 wrap and takes it down?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9, looking down on the whole operation.  @PERSON1 laughs a little bit and @CAPS8 ""@CAPS10 then it will be an inconvenience for the driver."" @CAPS11 wrapping roadways sounded a lot more fun than black ops, so we were all on board. Everyone gets in position. Mark, @PERSON4, @PERSON2 and myself are down by the roadway in a secluded area by some bushes. While @PERSON1, @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 are posted up on the roof giving us updates about the oncoming traffic. We get a call from @CAPS9 saying that it is clear for awhile. I hang up the phone, tell the guys, and quickly get up from the ground. We all get over the fence in quick time and start a first layer of @CAPS11 wrap. I get another call. It's @CAPS14 saying that there are three cars almost to our location. We drop the @CAPS11 wrap in the bush and get back over the fence. The @CAPS15 comes up close, and it's a cop. Of course. We all just stay hidden down in the bushes while the cop takes our huge roll of wrap. We are only left with one more roll, which should hopefully be enough.  @CAPS9 calls again and @CAPS8 it's clear. We go out again and start to set up the prank. We wrap it around @NUM1 times and make it as tight as it possibly could be. Perfect.  ""@CAPS15 incoming! Go! Go! Go!"" yells Mark while trying to get over the fence. We all make it over in time and go prone in the field. Laying there anxiously, someone whispers ""here it comes.""  The @CAPS15 slams on its brakes, and the driver gets out. He looks at the @CAPS11 wrap in disgust and looks around for the kids responsible. @CAPS9 lets out a big ""hahaha"" from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. The guy walks up to the fence, looks around a bit more, and mutters a few foul words under his breath. He doesn't even bother continuing through; he just gets in his @CAPS15 and backs up. ""@CAPS16 my god dude that was hilarious!"" I say with a wide grin on my face. @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 come dashing through the field with a scared expression on all of their faces. ""@CAPS18!"" yells @CAPS19, and we all scurry into different directions. Mark, @PERSON2 and I jolt over the fence and hide in the play structure for awhile. While the rest of the boys are booking it to a safe haven. We eventually all meet back up at @LOCATION1's house without getting ""caught"" by the authorities.  It's nights like @CAPS6 where laughter really plays a crucial role between a big group of friends like I have. The laughing and running makes us closer as a group; it brings us together."
148	20902	8	3	I wholeheartedly agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my opinion, most of the time when you're talking to someone, laughter is essential. It is what dispels the dullness from a person and makes the conversation truly engaging. Only when you are talking about something truly serious do you not need to include laughter, but I'll explain that later. So I can easily share a true story about laughter from my life. Right now, I have a wonderful group of friends. Sure, there are times when they mess up and act like kids, but I feel like I need to forgive them and remember that they are there for me when I really need them. Anyways, I can vividly remember the first time I met each one of them, and the one thing that kick - started our friendship was a joke. I can't exactly recall which joke we shared, but I do remember that we all had the exact same taste in comedy. And once we realized that neither of us were serious and dull individuals, it made us eager to spend more time with each other. That is why laughter builds a strong bond between different people and brings them closer together day by day. So as time went by, my friends and I were really drawn to each other. What I mean is that, from time to time, we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really silly. Many of them have caused physical pain and have led us to seek revenge on each other. But that is just how we stay close to each other. Day by day, when we come across something funny on the television, internet, or in real life, we always show it to each other, knowing that after showing this prank or whatever it is, the other person will find it extremely funny. It makes us feel more connected and assures us that we all share a common interest in at least one area. I can give one clear example of this: I was watching a comedy show once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood and a prank he once played on a stranger's house. Right when I saw this video, I knew right away that my friends had to see it because I knew from past experiences that they enjoy these types of laughs. And I was right. As soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was, and they were grateful that I shared it with them. We grew closer than ever. I want to share one more example from my life about laughter bringing two people closer. So after telling you that laughter helps me get closer to my friends, I also want to point out that laughter brings out a sense of connection when you talk to girls - or boys, if you're a female. So I met this one girl, and every time I talked to her, I had to throw in a joke or a story that was relevant to our subject. After a while, she started joking around and making up stories too. She told me that she saw me as a different kind of guy compared to others. She said that I wasn't a boring person, and it made her want to keep talking to me. Now, me and this girl are extremely close, and it all started with laughter. So as you can see, laughter makes any relationship happier and more open. Of course, I'm talking about relationships that are light - hearted. There are people out there who take everything seriously and can't take a joke. But I would really encourage you to embrace laughter in your life if you haven't already. Look at my life; I used laughter, and I gained a lot of great friends, of all sorts - just by joking around about silly things. You don't have to say the most brilliant things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter.
149	20904	8	3	These are some examples that I remember when I had a great deal of fun and laughter in my life. It all started in the @DATE1 time when I was around @NUM1 years old, and my cousins were living with us because they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. It was really fun having them around. My cousins and I would always ride bikes. Sometimes Joey would take my bike without asking, and I would get so angry at him. He would act like the bike was his. My cousins and I would always race down the street on our bikes. I was always the one to win the race. The kind of bike I had was a @PERSON4. It was a @CAPS2 bike, which is a bike specifically made for the dirt and for racing. My cousins and I would go behind some apartments down our street, and there was a ramp that we built. It was just made of dirt, but it was quite solid. One day when it was raining really hard, my cousins, a neighbor, and I were asked to come outside. We asked our parents if we could, and my parents said it was okay. The same went for @PERSON3. Joey's @CAPS4 said he couldn't go because it was pouring outside, but he still came out. We got all muddy. I fell off my bike while trying to go up the ramp when it was all muddy. Then my cousin got banged up from all the times he fell off
150	20905	8	3	"Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""@CAPS1! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS6!"" @CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS6 only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS3 and @CAPS8 would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS3 tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS5 god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON2 (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to jump. ""@CAPS6 you tell him I say hello?"" ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS8 told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON2 said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS3's friends said the same thing but @CAPS8 said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON2 came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS8 asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS8 said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS8 said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON2 out but I let it go just as @CAPS8 did when @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all. "
151	20906	8	3	Trust is a huge deal between friends. True friends not only agree on the same things but also openly share an honest opinion about them, thereby maintaining the trust within a great friendship. You never know who can whole - heartedly stay by you with unwavering trust. When you trust a friend, you rely on them to keep things confidential between the two of you. Just like my friends and I, we firmly agreed on telling each other every single thing that has happened and promised never to lie about anything. Our friendship has always thrived because we don't lie to one another. We freely share how we feel about certain things. Then we gather all our opinions and come up with a solution that we all whole - heartedly agree on. That's why friends should depend on each other like a well - coordinated team. When you break the trust with a friend, you probably won't regain the same level of trust as before. You won't be told as many things as you used to. It's as if you should have never let that trust slip away. You seem different because you're no longer fully trusted. You'll be blamed for lying or for any reason that led to the loss of trust. Like one time, one of my friends didn't tell me the whole truth of what she was doing behind my back. When I finally found out, I lost most of my trust in her. She's not as trusted as she was before, but we are still friends. That's why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship. You learn to trust each other in various ways, and get to know each other more deeply through that trust. You gain more attention when you have that trust with others. You don't feel left out of anything. You'll find that you can trust more people as you get to know them. Who knows, you might even develop trust for someone who isn't your best friend. So we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people or maybe even more. You need to work together to build and maintain that trust. As long as there is trust between you and others, you can have a good friendship or relationship. My friends and I have learned a great deal from trusting each other in different ways, and this trust has truly enriched our lives.
152	20907	8	3	"One day, when I was having trouble trying to cope with some very big changes in my life, I sought the help of a friend. Usually, when I'm having a bad day, I tend to keep to myself. But this was an occasion when I really needed someone else there to help me. So, I went and met with my friend. She tried all she could to cheer me up, but nothing seemed to be working. Then she said, ""Hey, want to hear a story?"" Wanting to hear anything that would take me out of the slump I was currently in, I said, ""Sure, I think it will help."" Then she began. ""The other day, my family and I went grocery shopping. We were gone for probably four hours."" I stopped her right there and asked her how this was relevant to making me feel better, and she said, ""The more details the funnier it is."" I told her to continue. She continued, ""When we got home, the parents started unloading the groceries. While they were doing that, my sister and I were in the living room teaching our dog how to sit, lay, shake, speak, and roll over. Every time she did a trick, we would give her half a dog treat. When the parents were done putting the groceries away, they walked in the living room and we showed them the tricks we had taught our dog, which they had yet to see. After we showed them all, my father had to say was, 'Please put the dog treats up so she doesn't get into them.' I replied with a simple 'Okay.' Then the parents said they would be back and that they were going to get pizza because they didn't want to cook after a long day of shopping, and then they left. While they were gone, my sister and I straightened up the living room and continued to train the dog. When the parents got back, we all sat down and began to watch TV and eat our pizza. After a while, when everyone was done eating, we were still in the living room. My sister and I heard my dad in the kitchen complaining about not being able to find the cookies they had bought. I looked at my sister and said, 'You know what would be funny? If dad thought the dog treats were cookies and ate one.' My sister giggled. Our dad came stomping into the living room and threw himself on the couch, acting like a four - year - old boy who had his game taken away. We began to laugh, and our dad looked over and scolded us, then looked back at the TV. Then out of nowhere, he said, 'I found them.' Or what he thought was them. He reached for the dog treats on the coffee table. My sister and I didn't dare speak a word. We watched him. He looked at the bag and reached his hand into the bag of dog treats and pulled one out. He looked at us and we looked away momentarily. Then our eyes fixed right back on him, beyond our control. We had to watch. He looked away to the TV again and put a whole dog treat in his mouth. He began to chew. Then he slowed down his chewing and tilted his head to the side, just like a dog would. What a coincidence. Then it sounded like he choked on a piece of it and he began to cough. He spit dog treats all over the back of my mom's head who was sitting on the floor. My sister and I began to laugh hysterically beyond our control. My dad was sitting on the couch with a straight face. I swear we could see the smoke coming out of his ears. He began to yell about how we should have put the dog treats up so this wouldn't happen, but in mid - sentence, he couldn't help it anymore. He began to laugh. Then we were all laughing, and then we looked at my mom who was still sitting on the floor, still in shock because she got sprayed with chewed dog treats. We couldn't stop laughing, and then she began to laugh."" When she told me this story and laughed so hard that I even cried. Then I realized, ""All you need is a little laughter in your day to brighten your life."" And that laughter really did lift my spirits that day."
153	20908	8	3	Have you ever had a fear of falling off of a cliff when up in the mountain? I have, and I actually had that terrifying experience. It was a winter day, and right after we had just gotten off of the bus, I quickly grabbed all of my gear from the storage under the bus and then headed for the slopes with my friends. We strapped in our boots firmly and then went to the lift to catch a chair up. The air was so crisp and cold, and the snow was like a fresh, soft blanket of powder. It was a perfect day for snowboarding. We were all so excited to go ride in that wonderful winter setting. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every winter day. So I talked to my friends and suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They readily agreed, so we went down through a new area. It was a really good trail with many exciting jumps and a lot of soft powder. It seemed like an absolutely perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much, whooping and hollering as we made our way down. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow. Then suddenly, there was a steep drop right in front of us. I quickly shifted my board sideways so I could stop, but it didn't help at all. It was a patch of ice that I hit, and it was completely useless. I couldn't stop my momentum. I fell off the edge, and I braced myself for the impact, my heart pounding in my chest. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the sharp rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool winter air with sparks that lit up the area. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, desperately trying to stop myself. As I finally came to a stop, I looked back in disbelief, wondering how I had survived that. I was really worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe what had just happened. I learned a valuable lesson from that incident: to always scope out the area first before you go through it. I was extremely lucky that I wasn't hurt; I could have been seriously injured. This experience will always stay in my mind as a reminder of the importance of caution in the mountains.
154	20909	8	3	"Laughter, everyone from cute babies to wise old people does it. Laughter is an essential element that helps in life. They say that ""laughter is the best medicine,"" and it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job, or sport, you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious all the time. Being overly serious, as they say, is not good. It makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor. In a particular season, I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me because I was chosen as captain along with my friend [Name]. We weren't the most well - liked captains, but we were liked by some of the team members. It was really hard for [Name] and me to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team effectively. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with [Name] and me being captains. But as they quit, we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had a tough time; they struggled a bit trying to get the hang of varsity play. But they were determined and managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players, we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of what would become a five - set game, we didn't exactly have our minds fully in it at the beginning. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but unfortunately, we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do, whether to give up or just half - heartedly play. It was tough, but as one of the captains, I said, ""Come on, we won't get anywhere unless we give it our all."" Then [Name] said, ""I agree, let's try our best and not let them get an easy win."" We did exactly that. We tried hard and we won that second set. It was the third set, and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated. But we pushed forward with all our might and won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court, and the ball was served. We let the ball hit the ground, giving point one to the other team. After that first point, it went downhill. We let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set, where we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose, but we started with determination. The first point went to us, and we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a really tough battle, but we had done it; we won. Later in the season, we met the team again, and it was a hands - down battle. We lost the second time we met them. It was not easy at all; they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but we let our performance slip. It was time for the state playoffs, and we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before, and we were one and one against them. The line - up was called, the national anthem was sang, and the coin was flipped. We would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, and we were doing great. We won the first set by four points; it was a tough first game. We went into set two, but we lost control. We didn't do what we were supposed to do. We lost the second set, and it was a real confidence - hitter. We were down and didn't know what to expect in set three. As captains, the team was looking at [Name] and me, and we shouldn't have let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that knowing look, and then we just busted out laughing. We couldn't stop. The team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win, we had to laugh. We couldn't let ourselves feel down. The team joined in the laughter, and we went into the third set confident as ever. We won that set, and we didn't stop there. We went into the fourth set and won it too. We had done what we set out to do: win! In the end, laughing was what we needed to do. We had come this far, and we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked back at the two previous games that we had against that team and laughed. We made ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh"" our team motto. The season was great looking back on it; we were state champs. Now in the new season, we are hoping to repeat our success and become state champs again, with laughter still by our side."

156	20911	8	3	"@CAPS1 brings enthusiasm and joyfulness to any means or matter. Have you ever thought of laughter being a part or key element in a relationship? A time when laughter has really helped or made a relationship is when I met one of my still today best friends. I had just started fifth grade at a new school; I transferred from private to public. There were only a couple of people I knew there because of family, and these people were my cousins. As you can imagine, sitting by the people whom I'd known for most of my life in this new environment was very awkward. So, eventually at the end of the day, I was eager to leave school. It was my first time ever getting to walk home since this school was much closer than my last. I had to walk home with a kid who lived right by me; this was something I had never known because of my sheltered young life. Luckily, he was easy to talk to, and we both had skateboarding in common. This is when we started @CAPS1 because we talked about certain falls we had which were not so pleasant, and he asked if we could hang out after school. As a shy guy, I nervously said okay. After a while, he came over with his skateboard and told me to go down this ramp I had. So, I mustered up the courage and did it, but I fell right on my back. We both thought it was hilarious and started @CAPS1 together. This @CAPS1 we did since walking home really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of bonded us. I feel that fall was a key part of our friendship because it made the awkwardness go right out the window and helped us start talking about more funny things we had seen. Ever since, every time we hang out, something happens, and we laugh as hard as you can imagine, which goes down in our memories as good times. @CAPS1 has always ""sweetened the mood"" so to say and always makes a good time a great time to remember or turns a truly boring time into a ""lets go do something"" time. Also, in any situation when I have been @CAPS1, or start to laugh, I feel good because everyone laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughs and the times I make them laugh. All in all, most of the relationships I have are because of @CAPS1 and how it comforts two or even more people by bonding them and making everyone feel like they're having a good time with each other. This is key because then most encounters with people, even friends, can be very awkward or not enjoyable. So, really in any case, @CAPS1 is a necessity because otherwise, everything would be dull, and you would really have no one to be able to have an appreciative time with. Therefore, every time I meet someone new or even someone I know, laughter needs to exist in order to have a relationship with anyone."
157	20913	8	3	"A lot of people always say that a sense of humor is very important when looking for a significant other, or even a friend. @CAPS4, unfortunately, some people don't realize @CAPS1 how much laughter can bring people together! I know now that all it takes is for two people to laugh together to become great friends. My best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, became my friends by doing @CAPS1 that. All my life, I've gone to small schools with my aunt, @LOCATION1. We are only two years apart, so we usually can stay within the same @ORGANIZATION1, and I never feel alone. @CAPS4, however, @CAPS2 ended up going to a different @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 than me. I would have to face @ORGANIZATION1 on my own. My freshman year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I was pretty nervous. It was my first time at a huge @ORGANIZATION1. I had @CAPS1 moved and didn't know anyone, so I was quite shy. I made my first friend pretty easily during one of my classes; @CAPS3. @PERSON4, the teacher, wanted us to have partners so that we could do a certain exercise together. @PERSON2 and I both chose each other for some reason; I don't know how, @CAPS4, but we were drawn to each other. @PERSON4 told us we would be doing the ""mirror exercise"". We picked somebody to be the mover and somebody to be the mirror. @PERSON2 ended up being the mover. I had to follow her movements exactly so that @PERSON4 wouldn't be able to tell who the mirror was. @CAPS4, when @PERSON2 started acting like a monkey, we both laughed, and @PERSON4 even laughed too. During lunch, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friend, @PERSON1. @CAPS2 claimed to have known her for several years. @PERSON1 and I smiled at each other, @CAPS4, but we didn't really talk at all. By the time my last class of the day came around, I was eager to go home. @CAPS5, because it was a @CAPS6 class, and I never really liked @CAPS6. I came to find that I shared that class with <@NUM1!</@CAPS7>. @CAPS8, since we had met already and shared @PERSON2 as a friend, we sat by each other. We still didn't have much to say though. A few days went by, and we still didn't really talk; we @CAPS1 awkwardly sat next to one another. Meanwhile, @PERSON2 and I became closer friends, acting out silly skits together in @CAPS3 class. Laughter was bringing us together, @CAPS4, but I didn't really notice because it wasn't any different than how I've made most of my friends. One day, we had testing in our @CAPS6 class, and we had to go to the computer lab. @PERSON1 and I chose computers next to each other. We started our tests silently, same as always. Then, suddenly, @CAPS2 turned to me and asked me if I had ever heard the ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12"". When I, very startled, replied no, @CAPS2 sang it for me, right there in the middle of the computer lab. When @CAPS2 finished, we both started laughing so hard that it hurt. Our teacher warned us to be quiet, and we got back to testing with smiles on our faces. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, @PERSON1 and I started talking and joking all the time! @PERSON2 noticed the change, @CAPS2 was glad we were getting along so well, @CAPS4, and wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day, @PERSON1 and I share laughs whenever we have the time for it. Even though I am busy with babysitting, @ORGANIZATION1, and my job, while @CAPS2 goes to college, nothing can stop the connection we made that day through the power of laughter! I have learned that laughter is a top basis for any relationship. @CAPS4, it is not the only one. You also need to have trust. If you can't trust someone, @CAPS4, even if they are humorous, that doesn't make them a good friend. You also need a sense of safety. If your friends are encouraging you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, they aren't very good friends. I know that @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are the best friends I will ever have. Laughter brought us together, and I know it will keep us together for generations to come."
158	20914	8	3	"@CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry. We hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now, @CAPS18 snacking on left - over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today; still pissed off about dropping the can - tine. I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can - tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind, no nothing. I looked up; the sun was at @CAPS11's peak, yet it felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled, bloodied lips, I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me. I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun - burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can - tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked, kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws?

""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance; not much to see, except a small brown dot. I couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked. The brown dot was getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 what I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots, which had started wearing out a few years ago, now revealed a gaping hole through which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know, but @CAPS11's pretty big and the @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot. I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger, a mile or so away from us now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we go'n see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked, watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to throw a party; her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar, I'd know if we were at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole to avoid stubbing it on a rock. Suddenly, I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth. ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly. I now realized @CAPS9 what that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" I climbed up over the door onto the front seats. The cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky, almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" As I searched through old, dusty papers, I managed to find a rock - hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half - empty bottle of what I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh, how I'd given anything for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. It was whiskey that I found inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile, I saw @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said, sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I stared out at the horizon; nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked, looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of"

We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head.

160	20916	8	3	"Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same."
161	20917	8	3	"The comfort of a warm laugh. Many different kinds of comforting sensations can come from a hearty laugh. My story is centered around the comfort of love. @CAPS6 i was a naive and impulsive young teen. (@CAPS1 wait that's what i would still be today.) A few days ago my dear friend @CAPS2 had me laughing uncontrollably, and all because @CAPS5 made an awkward slip - up while meeting my mother. (@CAPS2 was extremely nervous to meet my mother.) For some reason @CAPS6 i started to laugh heartily, and @CAPS5 suddenly began to act as if everything was perfectly fine, and that there was nothing to be nervous about. @CAPS7 later @CAPS6 we went for our leisurely walk and i asked him about it. I simply said ""@CAPS4 did your mood change @CAPS6 i began to laugh?"" @CAPS5 smiled gently and replied ""@CAPS6 you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright."" @CAPS7 myself being a typical shy teen girl, i blushed deeply, @CAPS7 quickly changed the topic, while trying hard not to make eye contact. Suddenly i could not resist. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was overpowering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough there @CAPS5 was staring straight back into my eyes. His eyes were truly wonderful; they reminded me of bright sunflowers set against a clear blue sky. As @CAPS5 stared back, i got a feeling as if @CAPS5 were trying to unlock all that i am, and all that i know with his intense gaze. As if @CAPS5 could see straight to my very soul. Quickly I turned away. With a soft and almost enchanting voice @CAPS5 let out a little laugh. This laugh was as sweet to my ears as nectar is to a hummingbird. The next few days were tough. All i could think about was that peaceful walk. People must have thought i was crazy, every time i would remember the walk, each time i would remember his gentle laugh. @CAPS7 let out a laugh of my own. @CAPS7 i realized that laughter plays a huge role in everyone's life. For me, i laugh @CAPS6 I'm with the people i deeply love. For some, it's watching a hilarious TV show that they find amusing, or maybe their kids did something incredibly silly. So silly that you just had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is everywhere. Laughter is never a bad thing; in fact, it has been scientifically proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't understand this. Laughter is not something to be ashamed of either. If someone laughs at you, just laugh with them. It's not laughter that starts wars. It's not laughter that takes lives. It's people who choose not to fill their lives with the pure joy of laughter. So here is the goal. Laughter can also be highly contagious. So try and @CAPS8 a laugh on. Do something that @CAPS6 people remember it and they will start their own chain of laughter. Laughter - @CAPS8 it on!"
162	20918	8	3	The benefits of laughter - we all understand the numerous benefits of laughter, such as it being the shortest distance between two people. And many people @CAPS1. We are going to specifically tell you how laughter works in a brotherhood that has had lots of great times because of laughter. Well, I know for a fact that me and my brother have the absolute best time when we are laughing and joking around. It seems that laughter makes us have the most amazing relationship that brothers can have, and we have a ton of fun. The next thing we are going to talk about is the power of laughter in a family and in a boy - and - girlfriend relationship. The way I think it works in a family relationship is that families get together, they sit around and talk about the past, and laugh about the silly things they did when they were kids. See, the power of laughter makes families come a lot closer together. In a relationship like a boy and girlfriend, well, here is how I see it. If the boy can't make the girl laugh, then the boy should probably never talk to the girl. I know girls who like to laugh and have a great time with their friends and their man. So men, learn how to make a girl laugh so that you can have some fun too and to show that you are not scared to talk to girls, okay. Well, that's how I see it. Let's move on. Well, I have talked about a brotherhood, a family, and a boy - and - girlfriend relationship, so let's talk about a friend relationship now. The way I see it is that people like friends who can make them laugh and have a good time with. That's the kind of friends that people want to have, and that's the kind of friends that I have and cherish so much. Well, let's move on to the last part. Well, now you see the benefits of laughter in a brotherhood, a family, a friend, and a boy - and - girlfriend relationship. Well, in the way I see it and in the way I think it works, and yes, there are people that @MONTH1 not think the way I do or see it the way I do, but that is their life and this is my life. Well, I hope you like the way I put the words in my story. So bye and see you next time. Laughter truly has the power to strengthen all these relationships, and we should all embrace it more.
163	20919	8	3	"Laughter is a clear sign of good relationships. To some people, it's a sign of a unique personality, a sign of deep - seated love, and also a sign showing someone that you genuinely care. To me, laughter is what makes people so distinctively special. Everybody has a different kind of laugh. For example, when you are a baby, @CAPS2 laugh is high - pitched and full of innocence. As the older you get, the lower @CAPS2 laugh becomes, ""like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1"". If it was not for his unique laugh, he would not be the person he is. When I was a child, I remember trying so hard to laugh just like @ORGANIZATION1 did. I would be walking around the house, making funny faces and trying to get my laugh really @CAPS1. My family thought it was the most adorable thing ever. They would ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 so they could have a good laugh too. Now today, my laugh is exactly what I wanted it to be, ""@CAPS1"". It is extremely hard for me to laugh quietly now. I have had some people tell me things like; ""@CAPS2 laugh is what I will always remember you by"" or ""@CAPS2 laugh is really something extraordinary"". I love my laugh because it is an integral part of who I am. Without laughter, you, me, or anybody else would not be the person they are now. Laughter is one of the most natural ways to show emotion. So go ahead and try different kinds of laughs. No matter what, you cannot change the one you were meant to have. Laughter is a part of our identity, and we should all be proud of it."
164	20920	8	3	"In my story, I am going to tell you about a really funny time in my life when me and my brother liked to play pranks on my aunt. @CAPS1 first paragraph is about the first prank that we pulled on my aunt. When I was about six and my brother was four, my aunt had just bought a gorgeous purple suede couch. She loved @CAPS1 couch so much, and me and my brother at the time thought that my aunt loved @CAPS1 couch more than she loved us. So me and my little brother took two big jugs of chocolate syrup and poured them all over my aunt's brand - new three - thousand - dollar couch. The second prank was just me. One day I was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was getting really frustrated with the game and I threw my controller down. Man, my aunt ran over and popped me in the back of my head so fast. She told me to be a good sport and try it again. But I was upset because I just got popped in the back of my head, so I was looking for some revenge. When my aunt went into the bathroom to put on her makeup for work, I went into the kitchen and got a grape soda. I walked over to my aunt's purse, cracked open the grape soda, and poured it all over the inside of my aunt's purse. The last paragraph is about the worst prank that me and my little brother have ever pulled. One morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleeping, me and my little brother were sitting on the couch watching television. My little brother said that he had to go to the bathroom, and knowing us kids, we do everything together. So me and my brother went @CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, and we saw the biggest box of fifty - four rolls of soft, luxurious toilet paper. Me and my little brother love toilet paper rolls for whatever reason, so we opened the box. My brother dropped one in the toilet, so I put one in the toilet, then he put another one in the toilet, then I flushed it. Little did we know that it would backfire on us, and the toilet started to overflow, but I kept flushing. Then I got another roll and started unwrapping it all over the floor. Then my brother got one, and @DATE1 we were knees - deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt walked through the front door. We didn't hear her because we were having so much fun in the toilet paper and water. Then she came @CAPS3 stairs, went to the bathroom to see me and my brother and a bathroom completely trashed. But the only thing that she said to us was, ""CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!"" She slammed the door, then me and my brother looked at each other and then started cleaning. Then finally, after hours of hard cleaning, the bathroom was back to the way it should be. These pranks were a wild part of our childhood, and although they got us in trouble, they also created some really funny memories."
165	20921	8	3	"Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to bring a big smile to your face. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories filled with joy, or thoughts of sweet nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broken the exciting news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the school year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school ended. The first reaction out of my mouth was full of pleading, wishing for my best friend to join us on this amazing trip. My parents took their time and carefully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and quickly responded in the affirmative. I was overjoyed to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now going to include my best friend. First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an enthusiastic ""@CAPS1!,"" I was @CAPS4 initially devastated when she postponed her response and didn't seem too excited. I didn't consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn't have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a colorful countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into account while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which famous landmarks, luxurious resorts, and trendy shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a detailed tour of the beautiful island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more enjoyable. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1! Many hilarious incidents happened often while we were on that wonderful vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a knack for making every situation funny, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls' night. First, and most importantly of our adventures, we went shopping in the large mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of various small clothing stores, delicious food shops, and shiny jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6 - shirt shop with chocolate - infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the unique designs that I think we ended up carrying a faint smell of cocoa with us for the rest of the night. As soon as we finished our shopping spree in the town center, we made our way back up to the room, laughing and chatting about silly things. The three of us girls shuffled with big smiles, tired feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately - designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a funny story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in the conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn't have a key card to open our room's door"
166	20922	8	3	"Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life. There was a time not too long ago that I was able to turn a girl's tears to laughter and made her day a little better. It all starts with the craze of today's teenage world, ""@CAPS1"". Which to those who don't know, it is a popular website where teens spend quite a lot of their free time on, and people can communicate easily through this website. I log in and see that this girl I like is also signed in, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of, ""@CAPS2, whats up?"" that sort of thing happens, and then she asks if I am able to hang out. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go hang out if it's a girl they like. I went to meet up with her at the local library and as always, she was beautiful, even though I doubt she was trying hard to look that way. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could think about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and are really happy, and everyday when I see her I say something random to make her smile. Laughter has truly become a special part of our relationship."
167	20923	8	3	"The Element of @CAPS1 and Laughter Laughter is an extremely important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. Laughing is a wonderful part in a person's life; it clearly shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a hearty laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their unique emotions; other people laugh heartily at hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at people's accidents while others don't find such things amusing at all. Emotions are a big deal in a person's life. Some common emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people naturally want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from the sheer intensity of their amusement. People like it when other people @CAPS4 are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. Some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. But jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say, ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2!"" ""@CAPS4's there?"" ""@CAPS5."" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?"" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke,"" and the kid would be laughing uncontrollably. But to someone @CAPS4 is older, you have to think a little more creatively to get them to laugh. People love laughter; they like laughing at people's jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is allergic to garlic. But most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. Furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. It is like when someone says that they have a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. You might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. It is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones. Laughter truly enriches our lives."
168	20924	8	3	Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together or just show your having a great time. In my experiences laughter comes at the best of times. On a typical @ORGANIZATION1 day at @ORGANIZATION1 I was sitting with my friends at lunch time just hanging out, chatting about what's going on in our lives, when I notice a girl sitting all alone. I don't recognize her, she must be a new student. I ask around to see if anyone knows anything about her; no one knows. Looking back at the girl she looks very lonely and in need of a friend. Curious to meet someone new I walk over to her and start making conversation. After a little while we relax and start to talk about our interests. I remember her saying something really funny and I started to laugh out loud, she begins to laugh at my laugh being as it's almost hysterical sounding and everyone around thinks it sounds ridiculous. At that moment as we're sitting there laughing together I realize, it's bringing us together making us closer despite the fact we had just met but ten minutes ago.  Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happy knowing that you can share that with someone you have just met or someone you have known your whole life is truly magical. It's a universal language that everyone should speak. Laughing is healthy and good for the heart. We should always cherish the power of laughter in our lives.
169	20925	8	3	There was this time during @CAPS1 vacation, and there was a thick layer of snow on the ground. My cousin @CAPS2, brother @CAPS3 and I were all getting together and going to go out to my grandparents' place. My brother @CAPS3 lives in @LOCATION2 and my cousin @CAPS2, and I live here in @LOCATION1. So it wasn't that hard trying to get us cousins all together. We were all getting together to go out to my grandparents and go snowmobiling together and stay the night out there for a couple of nights. When all of us got together, and were starting to go out there it was getting too late to go snowmobiling. We were all very kind of sad but it was okay. We just watched movies off direct @LOCATION3, and waited patiently for the morning to come. Once morning came of course it was way too cold to go out right when we woke up. So we made a big, delicious breakfast and after breakfast we all got ready and then sat around until it was warmer to go outside. Finally it was the afternoon! We all got dressed into warm, thick clothes to go out and go snowmobiling. We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind with it. My grandpa was driving the snowmobile and us kids were in the back. My grandma only went one time with us and then she got off because my grandpa was going way too crazy and we were all getting hit by each other when he was driving. Then once us kids were the only ones on the hood my grandpa was starting to go really fast! I was the only one who was completely covered in snow, and I looked like a real - life snowman. It was so funny! My grandma went running inside to get my grandpa's camera so she could take some pictures. It took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures. Then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day. After we got all done for the day I then really looked like a snowman. It was a fun day, and very funny how I looked as a snowman, but afterwords I got really cold. We went inside and I went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma was making hot, comforting chocolate for all of us. That vacation was filled with so many wonderful memories.
170	20926	8	3	"We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat, crammed tightly together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the brim, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON1, most likely a future comedian, started off cracking really funny jokes, just being his usual hilarious self. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.  The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each sharp corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day ahead. The morning flew by quickly, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to perform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. ""@CAPS2 ready,"" the official began in a tense voice, ""@CAPS3!"" I threw myself out of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled smoothly with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought hard to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche ""nice job,"" or a ""you'll do better next time"". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick ""thanks,"" with a smile before we both @CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between two people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitiveness in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands what a laugh can do, a laugh is truly universal and should be embraced in all aspects of life."
171	20927	8	3	"The Gift of Laughter As of this date, I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfather's face. He had on the same warm smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide, inviting grin that he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that day, so many years ago, he shined his happiness and love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My grandfather, who we all called Pop, had a way of keeping the peace and happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry with Pop, and no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was.  Pop was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on that special day with Pop. That day was our family's annual reunion with Pop, and soon after, he passed away. When I look back and realize how important that day was, I can see that it was a perfect occasion for everyone. It was a happy day, and my most vivid memories of my grandfather were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.  When that reunion kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Everyone in my family was in high spirits and was ready to enjoy the day with family. My favorite activity during each and every family event is to play my favorite games with everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called Hearts - Spades. Now Hearts - Spades was one of the many games that my grandfather was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, and would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced Pop and my cousin Tom to play Hearts - Spades with me. We went into the spare room and started dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, and to no one's surprise, Pop was winning. It was just before the food was ready and we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin Tom, or Pop said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny eight - year - old ears had ever heard, and I began to laugh.  My family was so thoroughly entertained by my laughter that they could not keep their smiles and laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy for my family, including my grandfather. Pop's smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so magical, yet so colorful and vivid in front of me, that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. Pop's smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.  No one knew that was our last reunion with Pop. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the last day I would spend with my grandfather. Everything was so perfect and so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, and if I had to choose my last reunion, that day would be perfect. My single memory of that day was laughing, and being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my last bit of time with Pop than a day where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, and smiles.  Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, and can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt and never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, ""Live. Laugh. Love."" I believe those three words can combine together, and act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to live out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, and love. Love brings us all together, and when we strive to be happy and to love, that is when we can truly live. My grandfather loved each and every one of his family and friends and made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever live it. He died after a life full of love, happiness, and, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter. In the end, the memories of that laughter - filled day with Pop will always be a precious part of my life, a reminder of the power of love and laughter in bringing joy and connection to our lives."
172	20928	8	3	"Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and that could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughing is great for your heart and mind too. It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start and make two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want to get to know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have to be 20 and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun.  Last summer I never had anything to do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next to my house, or an old folks home about 5 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying to make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences.  I started with the daycare. I woke up at 7 am, and walked to the daycare center. I wasn't sure what it was going to be like at all. I didn't even know if I was good with kids. I walked in, and stood there awkwardly. The daycare manager came up to me and asked me if I could help out with the 3 - year - old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously. Was I supposed to color for them? There's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if I follow directions then this day will get over faster.  When I went in, all the kids ran up to me with a smile on their face. ""Sit by me!"" one said. ""Come here!"" said another. ""There's a spot right here!"" ""Look at my picture!"" ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" To that, I looked down. There I was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that I absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them.  The next week I went to the nursing home. I was even more nervous there. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going to be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who I was there to see, I said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, ""Oh, I was going to volunteer."" She led me down the hall and told me that it was almost time for lunch so I needed to get ready to serve lunch. I did, and then I heard, what I assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before.  After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were there took naps after lunch, so there were only three people out there. I played first with a lady who used to be a nurse. I got to know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which I won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the Vietnam war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used to be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few too many, because he beat me at chess. Well, that was my excuse.  When I got done, I was in a great mood and I couldn't wait to come back again. I learned a lot that summer. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have to be the same as the person you're with to laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying to make the best of your day. I am so glad I decided to volunteer, otherwise I would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter. Through these volunteer experiences, I've come to understand that laughter truly is a universal language that can bridge the gaps between different generations and backgrounds, bringing joy and connection to all."
173	20929	8	3	A couple of months ago I was hanging out with my friend Jess. It was a sunny Saturday and I came to her place to spend the afternoon. At first, we were extremely bored, so we decided to go on a walk to find something interesting to do. We strolled around the neighborhood and eventually found our friend Dylan at the skatepark. We stopped to talk to him for a while, watching him do some cool tricks on his skateboard. After we had hung out there for about two hours, we headed back up to her house.  When we opened the door, her sister started freaking out because we had left and she got stuck with their younger brother Jake. Jess didn't yell back; she didn't want to start any drama. Her sister got even more mad because Jess was not showing a reaction to what she was doing. By ten minutes, she exploded and started throwing herself around and acting like a crazy person. She was stomping her feet and flailing her arms, looking so ridiculous.  Jess and I looked at each other and started laughing really, really hard because of how funny her sister looked. It was like watching a comedy show right in front of us. After a while, her mom had calmed the situation down. Jess and I then made a cozy bed on her bedroom floor using some blankets and pillows. As we were lying there, getting ready to fall asleep, we both burst out in laughter again. We were probably still thinking about her sister's crazy outburst. It was the funnest afternoon I have had in a long time. Those moments of shared laughter not only lightened the mood but also strengthened the bond between me and Jess, making that day a truly memorable one.
174	20930	8	3	Laughter is a daily part of my life. I'm always laughing in school, whether it's during a funny class discussion or when my friends crack a joke. At home, too, laughter fills the air when my family gets together for a meal or plays a game. With laughter, you can show many emotions that can't be told with words. It can express joy, amusement, and even relief. To me, it's also a way of showing how fortunate your life is, as it indicates that there are moments of happiness and light - heartedness in it.  I've had numerous occasions where laughter was the solution to my problem. For instance, when I was stressed about an exam, a funny video my friend sent me made me laugh and helped me relax. I also agree that laughter is an important part of a relationship. It can break the ice, ease tension, and create a warm and positive atmosphere. In the next paragraphs, I am going to talk about how laughter affects my relationship and the benefits it brings to it as well.  Approximately three months ago, my family and I decided to take a trip to Hawaii. We planned to stay there for a month or so. When I told my boyfriend that I'd be gone for a month, right away I saw the sadness in his eyes. This truly killed me. However, our decision was made and there was no turning back. Our relationship was tense during that month. We talked a few times on the phone, but his voice was different. There was a sadness to it and I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was good, I knew his sadness was due to my absence.  After the month had finally ended, it was time to come back to New York! I was truly excited. We arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 3 pm on a sunny Friday afternoon. I immediately called him but there was no chance of seeing him that same day. Although, just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and anxious. We conversed for endless hours on the phone, telling each other that we would never be that far apart again. We laughed and laughed during our whole conversation. We talked about funny things that had happened to us during that month, and his laughter on the other end of the line was like music to my ears. To me, the sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness and that was just priceless. The laughter was as if it had been a blessing to our relationship. It melted away the tension and brought back the warmth and closeness we had before.  From that day on forward, I realized how much laughter really affects me in numerous ways. It's as if it brings happiness

176	20932	8	3	Looking back on my early childhood, one thing that stands out bright and shiny in my vivid memory is the warm and infectious laughter. Since the moment I was born, I have always had an innate love to smile and laugh heartily. I've discovered a kind of deep - seated comfort, serene peace, and unwavering confidence through laughter alone, which I sincerely doubt I would have been able to find elsewhere naturally. This could, in part, be because of my dear Grandfather. We rarely get to see each other because he lives in a small, cozy town in the countryside and I live in the bustling city. But when we do have the precious luxury of spending time together, it is always filled to the brim with laughter and pure, unadulterated joy. I credit him whole - heartedly for giving me my love for laughter. I've been told by my parents that as a baby, all my Grandfather had to do was let out his booming laugh, and my eyes would brighten up like twinkling stars and a wide smile, as wide as the expansive ocean on my face, would become apparent. It's been that way ever since. One of my earliest and most cherished memories is laying on my parent's soft bed, listening intently to my Grandfather tell me hilarious jokes. Every time he finished, I would erupt in uncontrollable laughter, and at the sight of me laughing so merrily, he would burst out too. The important detail to note is, when my Grandfather laughs, his big belly shakes violently like a jiggling jelly. I found this the most delightful part of the jokes. Once his belly started bouncing up and down, my laughter became completely out of control. Our laughter escalated until tears of happiness were streaming down our faces. Besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my Grandfather has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one has ever been fortunate enough to hear. It's one of those fabulous and enriching laughs which words simply do not do justice, but once you hear it, you won't ever forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. For me, his laugh almost has a medicinal, healing quality. Whenever I hear my Grandfather laugh, for just a moment, the world stops, and everything within is okay. I am not the only one who has a great appreciation for my Grandfather's laugh. My father and him both have a love for telling jokes, which I have observed over the years, is one of the few things they hold a common agreement on. Everything from politics, to religion, to who should pay for dinner, usually ends in an argument between them. Because of that, they tend to stay clear of those topics for fear of confrontation. They have never mentioned this, but from my observation over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often, acts as the glue which keeps their relationship strong. Were it not for laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. I will forever be thankful for the great gift my Grandfather unknowingly gave me at such a young age. He created a deep and passionate love for laughter inside me, which has gotten me through the roughest times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. My day can be going horribly, and in the instant that a joke is cracked, and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens and the worries and stresses of my day seem so insignificant. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my Grandfather taught me. If you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most disastrous moments. Laughter, to me, is somewhat like a drug. It's a harmless, enriching, and life - saving drug which I can proudly say I hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my wonderful Grandfather.
177	20933	8	3	Laughter is such a truly marvelous element to have in any relationship. For instance, if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship, then I'm pretty certain there is no strong connection between the two of you. For example, I was in a relationship once where we didn't have that essential element of humor, and I truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that she and I had. Any type of relationship needs laughter, whether it's friendships, between boyfriends and girlfriends, or even within a family. All different types of relationships need some form of humor to thrive and survive. Sometimes families don't have that humor for each other, but they'll still have that special type of a deep - rooted friendship. The reason for that, I believe, is because your family will always be there for you, unlike most friends would. One way I know this is because one of my friends really liked a guy. I could have sworn she, in that summer month, might have even loved him. When he told her that he started dating some girl, she had cried for weeks. Then, when she was at her mom's house, one of her brothers, whom she believed hated her, said he wanted to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry. They, in that same month, did not have a humorous friendship, or even a friendship at all. But I believe laughter isn't necessarily always needed, especially within family. All types of relationships are like plants. The flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without that water, the plant won't grow, just like in a relationship without laughter. I know that if I knew someone who I did not find to be humorous, I know our friendship would not be very strong, unlike someone who I felt was hilarious. Laughter is always an important element in everyday life. For instance, if you are going for a job interview, you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself. One way of doing that is through laughter. I have heard of many stories about job interviews. An example of one is my mom had an interview not too long ago for a high - profile job. She told me about her interview and she said they had really connected. There was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview. Then three days later, they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her. And I have heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had an interview once for a pet kennel type of place where people drop their pets off while they go on vacation. She said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection, which led to no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness.
178	20935	8	3	Laughter is key. You never really think about the importance of laughter, but the truth is, laughing brings the most opposite people together. Last year, I met one of my brother's friends in school. We never really talked, but she seemed like a nice person. We had a class together and we started talking more and more every day. She was best friends with my best friend. Sarah was her name and she drove a bright orange Volkswagen Beetle. We hung out after school one day. I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and was sitting on it like a lazy dog. She suddenly slammed on the brakes and I flew into the front of the vehicle. I couldn't stop laughing. At that moment, I knew we were going to be great friends. I was a freshman, so I didn't really know anyone, and she was always nice to everyone. So we started hanging out more. I lived about 10 miles out of town, and her brothers went to school about 5 miles past my house. So we had to go pick them up. We bought a game called 'BeanBoozled'. There are tons of little jelly - beans that were flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten egg, etc. So we were playing while we were driving out there, and Sarah had to stop the car nearly 3 times in our 15 - mile drive! Those were the nastiest beans ever! Then, we would drive out to my house and we'd listen to our favorite country songs and blast them in her car. She was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her. Whenever we would get in fights, we wouldn't start drama. We'd always have an actual physical fight because by the time one of us was pinned, the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and my dad became friends later on too, and we would always have barbecues and family get - togethers. We also talked in a southern accent all the time because one of our friends was from Texas. Whenever we went to the mall to go shopping, we'd use our accent, and everywhere we went, people would ask us where we were from. Before we knew it, our dads started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words, and then the whole school started using them. She is a great friend and she keeps me laughing every day. Whenever Sarah was having problems with her family, she knew she could always talk to me, and I would always be there for her. She always called me sister instead of friend because we were so close. She used to take cooking and sewing classes at my old high school. When she got the fake baby doll, it would keep us up late into the night. That baby was crazy. Sarah would be driving, and the baby would start screaming in its car seat, and we'd have to pull over and find out what was wrong with it. She'd be a good mom. She always cared for things, even the smallest little thing she would cherish. One time, we painted her little brother's room because we were bored. Sarah was rolling her paintbrush in paint and texting. She took her eye off of her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for like 10 minutes, and by the time she did find it, it was totally covered in green paint! I laughed at her for so long, and those are the moments I wish I could bring back. Every time we hung out, I would laugh, and I realize now how important that laughter is to me. About six months ago, I moved to a whole different state, and I don't see her very often. There is no one like Sarah. She could make me laugh and was always just 10 minutes away when I needed something. Now I have to drive about 2 hours to even see her. I haven't laughed like she made me ever since I went back to visit. Laughter is key, as I stated before, and if you frown, you'll never know who is falling in love with your smile.
179	20936	8	3	"A few years ago, when I was 15, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of my great friends, I did really well in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. My clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time, I would try hard not to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try not to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that, I only had to wait for the weekend to end and Monday to begin. On Monday morning, I woke up and did my usual daily routine, then tried on my new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from my classmates as they took in my outfit. It was pretty tough trying not to laugh at some of their expressions, but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on my clothing, and some of my teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing as usual. But when I told them of my experiment, they understood and said, ""Good luck."" As the day came to an end, I was satisfied with my success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if my theory would be proven wrong. But on Wednesday morning, my mom pointed out that I seemed different. ""Are you okay?"" she asked. ""You don't seem as energetic in the morning, and you're not smiling at all. Are you sick or something?"" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while, it got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry, and they forgave me, telling me it was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that my theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when it ended. Thursday was the last day of my experiment, and for that, I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but it was hard not laughing, and it was starting to make me feel depressed. That day, I decided to wear some of my bright clothes to see if it would change anything. When I got to school, some of my friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in my other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore my dark clothes. In the end, I had to stand in front of the class to give my conclusion. ""My theory has been proven semi - correct,"" I stated. ""Trying not to laugh did have an effect on my mood and attitude. I was yelling at my friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that"
180	20938	8	3	Laughing, laughter.It's every where. Lots of people are laughing right now.Why not laugh though? It's good for you right? It feels good to laugh here an their. Well laughter can make your day great. It can help you get through hard times. It can help you cheer up your best friend to be happy. Well it really don't matter what the reason is, but its good to laugh. Laughing is great for you an it brings fun, joy, an helps you enjoy little more. My mom and I have a great relationship. Every time we are together, or we start talking we will laugh an crack each other up. Laughing has helped us get to having a great relationship were we can tell each other anything. I can go to her any time an ask her for help. I can go an talk to her any time I need to now. Be for we had a great relationship she wasn't doing to good she was involved in not to good of things. She was very depressed too. Ill tell you a little about it.   My day started off as a normal school day, I got up got ready, got on thus to school then be for I new it I was on the bus on my way home. I get off a block or two away from my house and then I walk home. I walk and walk, an about ten minutes later I get up to my house. I go to my room an put my bags down on my bed and go say hi to my mom. I walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair. I had asked her if she wanted to go on a walk. Well of course she said yes.She gets her shoes on an I do the same.We walk down are drive way an that's where the walk starts.        We started walking down the road after we got to the end of are drive way. We walked straight for about five minutes, then take a right.We walk that way for about ten minutes an turn left. Their is a little store on that coroner. We stopped their to buy some water an some snacks on the walk. After we get done we start walking east on the road. When I looked back at my mom she look like she was having a really bad day. Like anyone i asked her what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she seemed really sad, and depressed. From that I knew i need to talk to her an make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she was always gone hanging out with friends. I knew if i could make her laugh, an help her get better, it would help us get along better an help each other out in the long run. I love my mom an I hate seeing people down. I though all this in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh.  The walk was about three to four miles long. for the rest of the time I got her to laugh an laugh the whole way back. It made her feel a lot better i know that. Later that day she came in my room and we played some bored games and watch a movie or two. We really just talked and hung out for the rest of the day. We went on a couple more walks for the next month or two and we got a good mother an son relationship. We were both happy this had happened. About two months from the first walk w had she came up to me and hugged me and told me thank you for helping her out with what she was going though. I think laughter is a great thing in life. For me it helped me out a lot in life an it helped me save a relationship with my mom. I love laughing, and I love making people laugh it is fun to laugh an fun to make people laugh. Laughter makes great friendships. It can have a lot to do with your life. I hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny an have people laugh with you.    
181	20939	8	3	Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't go away very easily. Even the simplest things can make you laugh or smile. The point is, happiness is going to be around for a while. My dad laughs, my mom laughs, I laugh, and everybody laughs. It's truly a good thing to have. If there was nothing to be happy about, then people would be in fights, and countries would be in wars. Anger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax every now and then. My parents and I know that happiness is what drives us to good things. That's why we embrace it in our house, and we like to acknowledge it to my younger siblings. My dad and I have a good relationship, as well as with my mom. We get along well and laugh together. Me and my girlfriend at @LOCATION1; we started out in a good relationship, but as time went on, it was starting to fade. We weren't communicating as well, and that's what was driving us apart. We were just ending up in fights all the time, and for no reason, fighting just seemed to find us all the time. We talked, we hung out, and we started getting along better, laughing at our jokes or our constant teasing to one another. We had a good time. She said that she liked us laughing and having a good time. I told her that laughing and enjoying ourselves is what brought us together. Laughing is the key to our happiness; it's what made me and her closer. It's a main key point to any relationship. If there is no happiness, then there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter, then how are you supposed to get happiness? They work together, and it's a good thing to have in life. Where would we be if we didn't have it? We would all have a grudge for no reason and just live in black and white all the time. Laughter truly enriches our lives and makes every moment more meaningful.
182	20940	8	3	A few years back, me and my dad were sitting at home, comfortably watching @CAPS1 on the couch. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment, making a lot of noise. Every time they came inside, they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door. Finally, my sister shut the door, but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know. He was running so fast that before he knew it, he was going full - speed first into the sliding glass door! My dad and I were laughing so hard that I almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing, we went to go check on him, and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door, and without a doubt, it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile, after more laughs and fun, things calmed down, and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep, and his cat was laying next to him. My dad kind of woke up and looked around. After a few minutes, he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping. He took advantage of it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat, and it jumped about two feet into the air. Once again, we started laughing really hard, but this time, my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1, my dad, my brother, and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends, and so I did. He flipped the switch, and next thing I know, I was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next, it was my brother's turn, but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself. When he did, he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4 - able to free himself from a nine - volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears because it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves, we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues. I tried it first, and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result of all these great funny times, we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away, and @PERSON1 moved. In better words, funny times may be in the past, but they are always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces, and these memories will forever be a part of our lives.
183	20942	8	3	A @ORGANIZATION1 is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life, I felt confused and all by myself. I was empty inside. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I might be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me. I was six years old when my parents got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, tenderly told me he loved me, and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS1 living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think I was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long, and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum. About two weeks after my @CAPS1 had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was, rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as great entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name, and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day, and it continues to inspire me to find joy in life.
184	20943	8	3	"Laughter is the best medicine. Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, whole - heartedly agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine, but all I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room, doing a word - search. It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1, @CAPS27 step - dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well, so @CAPS4 went upstairs and started on her big book of word - searches. @CAPS27 step - sister had recently gotten a new car, so @CAPS4 and @CAPS27 step - dad were outside looking at it. I went out for just two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step - brother was on @CAPS27 step - dad's iPad. He showed me this game on it, and we started playing. A few minutes later, @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step - dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step - sister, and @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step - brother, decided to go with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left, and I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was doing her word - search, and I started to help her. I don't remember the name of the word - search, but we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started, I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently, I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it, and @CAPS27 mom said, ""@CAPS1 me?"" Then I started laughing. I repeated myself, and we were both laughing. After that wore off, we finished the word - search and started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS4 took the book and looked over the list, and suddenly said ""@CAPS5 - winks! Yeah!"" I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy, which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again, and I start laughing really hard and ask, ""@CAPS7's @CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong, but when we were laughing that hard, who wouldn't? ""@CAPS7?"" @CAPS4 asked, and I showed it to her. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" @CAPS4 said, and we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say."" I comment, and @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song, which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word - search, but we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21."" There were several things on it that we didn't know. I asked her what one was, and @CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" Then I asked her another. ""@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny, but only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word, which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't, but ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" @CAPS27 mom said. ""@CAPS7? Ear - hair?"" I asked, and we laughed again. When we finished that, we went onto ""@CAPS29"". That was a funny word - search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS30"", and I laughed and said ""@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard. ""@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie and @PERSON1 walked in the room and looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' I showed her the word - search. ""@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS4 managed to get out, and I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie and @PERSON1 then said good - bye and left. ""@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at what @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS46 away."" @CAPS4 said with a smile. ""@CAPS48."" I said before turning and walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this"
185	20944	8	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This @CAPS2 started out like any other @CAPS2. Me waking up thinking what am I going to do. So I walk out of my room, ask my mom if we have any plans. She says that we don't have any plans. So after I talked to her some more. I went back into my room and there I saw that I had gotten a text message from my @CAPS1 friend @PERSON3. He asked if I wanted hang out with him. I decided of course I can because I had no family plans. ""I would love to hang out with you @PERSON3"".  @PERSON3 and I met at the @NUM1 bus stop on royal and we went to @ORGANIZATION2. See now the reason why we went to @ORGANIZATION2 was because the @CAPS2 before I had gotten a gift card from my grandmother and fifty dollars from @CAPS4 (@CAPS4 is my biological father). When we finally got to @ORGANIZATION2 asked me what are we going to get here. I said anything I want. him start busting up laughing. I bot a jackass shirt and some food. From @ORGANIZATION2 we went to @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to get some delicious food.  When we walked into the restaurant, the aroma from the place made us drool a little bit. @PERSON3 got a big bowl and stuffed @CAPS15 with everything he could. We ate so much. I ganged like ten pounds. We talked about life and how awesome the food was. Where we were going next was still undecided. We finally finished our food. I payed for the to bowls of food and we went to our bus stop and went to downtown @PERSON1. While we were on the bus @PERSON3 decided that we shall go to @ORGANIZATION1.  So we got off the bus and what do you know my friends @CAPS8 boy, @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were downtown chill en like a villain. @PERSON3 went and smoked a cigarette. While I went and checked the bus schedule for the @ORGANIZATION4 bus. Him and I had to wait for @NUM2 minutes. So we gust hung out with our friends. @CAPS9 is the funniest guy @CAPS3. I laughed until I started to cry. I almost pissed myself.  We left to go get on the bus, laughed some more. When we got to the @ORGANIZATION4 we had know idea why we even went there. So we just walked around. @PERSON3 decided that we should into the photo booth to make this @CAPS2 legit. I had a lot of fun getting our picture taken. Next place we went was @CAPS11-topic. I love that store. We were in there for @CAPS3.  About two or so hours pass.  At the @ORGANIZATION4 there is this park that you can go to but you have to cross the bridge to get to @CAPS15. @PERSON3 and I got bored and went on an epic adventure to this park. There was a couple trails that we walked. I tripped on a branch. @PERSON3 laughed at me. We found this piece of concrete. @PERSON3 and I put on some music and danced to @CAPS12 @CAPS13. I love @CAPS14 music its really fun to dance to. I had orange soda that @PERSON3 drank. I took a lot of pictures of him drinking the soda. We pretended that the grass was lava and the concrete was a place for break dancing in cave man days. I took a video of @PERSON3 dancing and laughing to the song @CAPS15's the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 by sponge bob. He also ate all of my chips that i bot at @ORGANIZATION2. After that we went back onto the trails and skipped through the tree's. I trow skittles at birds and old people. While telling them to taste the rainbow.  We finally realized that we needed to get back home so him and I started walking back to the bus stop. Missed the first bus the caught the next one. Hung out downtown for an hour. Chilled with my downtown friends at @NUM3 park. Got a donut from @ORGANIZATION3. That place is epicly bad ass! Got some intents from this cool store by the station.  As the @CAPS2 ended @PERSON3 and I went our separate ways home. Both still to this @CAPS2 saying that, ""that @CAPS2 was epic""."
186	20945	8	3	One day after school, my friends @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 came to my house. They said, “Get clothes on that you can get dirty in.” I initially said no, but then I gave in and said, “Ok, fine.” Then @CAPS1 said, “Put rubber boots on.” So, we all started to walk to a park. We went on the train tracks. When we got off the train tracks, we walked down this really steep hill. I slipped and slid down on my butt. They were all laughing at me from the top of the hill. Then they came down, but they didn't fall. So, we kept walking and crossed a log to get to the other side. We continued walking, and then they took me to a mud puddle. They told me it was deep, so I walked in it. I got stuck in the mud because it went past my boots. I was trying to get out, but I leaned too far forward and fell in the mud. @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 thought it was so funny and laughed at me. The boots were still stuck in the mud. I was on a log, so I asked @CAPS2 to go get my boots. She tried and fell in. I started laughing at her, but then I went in, and we both tried to get my boots out. But it was too hard, so I put them back on in the mud. I was still stuck and couldn't get out. But @CAPS1 came and helped. I got one boot out, then the other one. Then @CAPS1 got stuck, and me and @CAPS2 ran back in. We all started to push each other. Everyone was falling and laughing at each other. But Megan was up in a tree watching. She didn't want to get dirty. Then, after that, we got all of our jackets and started to walk home. When we got to the steep hill, I fell down. So, I ran up the hill and didn't slip back down. Then @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and @CAPS2 were trying to walk back up it. It was so funny watching them climb up the hill. So, we all made it up after a while. We walked home on the train tracks, and everyone was looking at us because we were all muddy, besides @CAPS3. We kept walking, and then we got to Austin's house. We got his hose out, and he sprayed himself to get the dirt off. While he was doing that, me and @CAPS2 were talking. Then she told me to put a handprint on her face, so I did. Then she told me now she gets to do it, and I said, “Hahaha, you're funny.” So, I ran away from her, but she got me. Then we both got rinsed off and went up to my house.
187	20946	8	3	Human beings are...unusual...Okay, we're weird. There are so many people in the world, including ourselves, and the only way we can like ourselves is if we can get others to like us. If that isn't strange enough, we still don't like ourselves no matter who likes us. Just what are we thinking? We are always using relationships to assist our understanding of who we are; it's a gamble to even have those relationships. Face the facts, we risk so much on relying on others; we give them the ability to build us...or break us. Our major goals as youngsters is to find people to like us. I think it might even span to later times in life than that! From my experiences, I know there are two key points in knowing a person can build us: trust and kindness. Finding builders with these traits is as easy as understanding if they bring you joy or not. A person can give you joy by simply being kind to you...but if you want a whole swarm of friends, then this isn't exactly the best way. It's not that kindness is a bad way to make friends...it's just that it's not the fastest method. If a builder is kind, then of course you would become their friend...in time. In order to immediately know a friend when you see one, they will make you laugh. Laughter makes us enjoy our time with our friends; it's a golden rule in the book of @CAPS1, if there is such a book. And it was through laughter that I made my experience in @CAPS2 class better. @CAPS2 class, to me, was extremely stressful. Every day we had either a speaking assignment or we had paperwork; and the class was really slow. Why was it slow? It was slow because we could hardly get through one set of instructions without some group speaking or finding some other way to disturb the class. A good example would be this one class project we had to do. As usual, the instructions were slow; I was at my boiling point. Today seemed different though. Despite the usual annoyance, not a single student asked for a repeat on instructions. In fact, they all seemed to understand and immediately started working. I too followed in with this action. The assignment was that each group of about three to four people had to create a script using the vocabulary learned from the supplied booklet. It took a whole class period, and then everyone went home to do their other work. The next day we returned to @CAPS2 class, and it was definitely an interesting one. The teacher had all kinds of strange props lined up for us. Apparently, we were going to have the audience act out our script, and our job was to read it out loud. My group was first to entertain, and we had finally selected our volunteers and actors. Tiffany, @PERSON1, and I sat down in the back of the classroom, ready to read the script, not sure what the actors would deliver. Our play was... a success?! By the end of the first sentence, everyone was giggling. As we moved further on to the next play, the laughter had grown louder. Students were really enjoying themselves, and more people volunteered to perform until it was difficult to choose actors. Even I, the classroom - snob, was enjoying myself. The plays were fun and random; some plays would send everyone into hysterics. I can easily remember one of the groups making me laugh so hard that my sides were aching, and tears lined my lids, and it was almost impossible to breathe. This project was definitely the best one I had ever participated in. It's moments like these when we build strong unity in the classroom. We enjoyed all of the people around us, and we enjoyed ourselves. I was so used to being angry at my classmates that I was taken by surprise on that one day. Enjoying their plays so much, I now look at them as an entertaining group of students, rather than the annoyance I had seen them as before. No longer are these people strangers in the hallway; now they are family. It really is amazing how something as simple as laughter can change one's outlook on others and themselves.
188	20947	8	3	The Power of Laughter. What would we be without laughter? Would we still have relationships/friendships like we do now? Laughter brings out a sense of connection closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure you life would not be the same as it is now. Without laughter, my winter vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over winter vacation, my friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it may sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried our hardest to embarrass her. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. You name it, we did it. She was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, my closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seam on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over. “Hey @PERSON5,” I began, “@PERSON2 and I found these shorts yesterday, and thought that you might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top.” “Wow! Thanks guys, they fit great!” @PERSON5 screamed as she filled with excitement. “Let's go to the mall!” After about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw my phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran after it as it slid down the walkway. Just as she was about to bend over and grab it, her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing we know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on her face was priceless. I wish I had had my camera. We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. She was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still laughing at her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh at someone's pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people at the mall? “You guys are so mean,” she screamed. “@PERSON4 saw me, and you're laughing? He's never going to talk to me again. I hate you guys!” “You don't hate us. That was hysterical and you know it,” chimed @PERSON2. “We embarrassed you pretty good, huh?” “We did it! We did it! We did it! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,” I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high - five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up too, and apologized for freaking out after realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, she was planning to get us back. By the end of winter break, we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one at @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut feeling that this was going to be the best one yet. Everyone was having a blast at @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was at the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo my bikini top, and pull down my bikini bottoms! Humiliated, both of us ran into @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could she take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we won't do it again, and we now know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, you can now see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do you have any experiences where laughter brought you and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?
189	20948	8	3	During the winter break, my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were headed to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long, but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents' house, there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later, while I was outside, I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for winter break. They still had to go to school. I told them that if they were lucky, then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. On @DATE3, they went to school, and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off. Now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night, my grandma made us some barbeque chicken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandma's cooking, and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air - soft guns. It would be my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air - soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. “How am I shooting it wrong?” I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward, but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of those times. But he was one of my good friends, so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked me to hold onto his air - soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So, while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on
190	20949	8	3	"Laughter"" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good."
191	20953	8	3	"A while back, I had a dear friend named @PERSON4. We were inseparable best friends; like two peas in a pod. Every single day @DATE1, we would hang out from morning till night. One random sunny day, we walked up to our other friend @PERSON1's cozy house to see if she could join us. We all spent the whole day together having a great time when @PERSON1 came up with an exciting idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON2 to stay the @TIME1. We stayed out a little past dark, strolling and chatting around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could quickly grab her clothes and then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION2's house and just chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes, just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy and funny stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, playfully smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2. When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing along to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I calmly directed him to where he was going and he said, ""@CAPS6 you,"" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me with wide eyes and screamed, ""That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her a hard time @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1. We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some cold drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re - retracing our steps, we came across this kind - hearted guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before we even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in. It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl."
192	20954	8	3	Do you think that being part of something is fun? Well, sometimes it's not always breezy fun because you might be in a difficult situation. I think that being in a relationship, it's extremely important to trust the other person. Because if there is no trust, then there is no real relationship. There are some people @MONTH1 who try to keep things open. There are also some people that you can trust. They will surely help you. They will tell you what the other people are saying about you and the other person. In my opinion, the person you can get along with a lot of people. If you know a lot of people, you can get along well with them. I have a really good friend who trusts me. Trust is a wonderful thing. If you don't have any trust, you're nothing. And sometimes it's great to be in a relationship. You feel happy when someone is with you. You can tell the person everything. Like for me, I didn't talk much with my brother before. Now I tell him everything. Before, I didn't trust him because he always wanted to tell my mom and then I would get in trouble. Now he doesn't do that. Now it's really fun to hang out with him. Having fun is a great thing. Because you can go to a party or you can go out with your friends. Or you can go to Mexico and visit. For me, I will travel to have fun. I will take my friend to go to the park and go to the malls. From there, I will go to see my grandmother. It's these kinds of relationships and experiences that make life rich and fulfilling.
193	20955	8	3	Everyone laughs in different ways. Some people laugh so hard that tears stream down their faces, while others just have a soft chuckle. But one thing that they all share is the power of laughter. People use laughter as a wonderful way to express their feelings of pure joy, or intense happiness, or even when something is just really, really funny to them. Laughing is an amazing way to feel better about things. For instance, maybe you're having a truly bad day, and then one of your close friends comes up to you and tells you a hilarious joke. It instantly makes you feel better, doesn't it? Having a good sense of humor is a valuable trait that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing moments, or even just a plain bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and at something embarrassing you might have done is a great thing. It can help you quickly get over it and not be overly embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh, I always feel a wave of positivity. Laughing reminds me of all the wonderful things in life. It reminds me of the amazing good times I have spent with my friends and family. It brings back memories of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years, and we can still laugh at them just as hard as we did when we first thought of them. I firmly believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone. It can make you feel better no matter what the situation is, and some people even say that laughing makes you look and feel younger. When you laugh at things, it creates long - lasting memories that you'll never forget. And when you talk about them again in the future, you'll still find them just as funny as before. Some of my best friends have a contagious laugh. They laugh at everything. They think that every little joke is the funniest thing ever. Their laughs are so distinct and unforgettable that you can always hear them laughing from afar. This shows in another way how laughter can make anyone happy. If you think you're not a funny person, just say something to one of them, and I can guarantee that they'll laugh at it. You'll then feel funny and most likely start laughing as well. I enjoy spending quality time with some of my closest friends. Probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for the beginning of @DATE1 before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We excitedly packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. Not even half - an - hour into the car ride, and we were already cracking up laughing at every little thing that happened. We always create great memories, and this one was already shaping up to be one of the best. I'm sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun. We sang songs and danced (as much as we could while buckled down in our seats) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course, during the car ride, we got stopped by construction. So we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the other cars watched, and even the construction workers thought it was hilarious. We turned a boring moment into a fun one. Once we finally got there, we didn't hesitate to drop off our bags, grab our bikes, and take off to explore. The weather was perfect, with not a single cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride, we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day, we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft. It sounded like a really fun idea. Well, it would have been if we actually knew where we were going. I used to do it all the time with my family, so I had a rough idea of where to go. But still, five girls, two rafts, and a river - maybe not such a great plan. During the whole river raft trip, we jumped back and forth between the two rafts and occasionally splashed each other with the oars. Knowing us, we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people, I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us because of how much we were laughing and enjoying each other's company. By the time we finished the rafting trip, we were starving. Good thing my mom had prepared us some delicious lunch for when we got home. When we sat down at the table, we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and burst into laughter. You know you've built a great friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter, these memories will stay with us forever.
194	20956	8	3	"Laughter can be used for many important things. One of which is being an important part of a relationship. There are many key elements in a relationship. But, the most crucial one is definitely the idea that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Sometimes, laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. But sometimes, it doesn't completely cure it. If laughter is the shortest distance between two people, then when a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I once went up to a girl and was so nervous that I couldn't figure out what to do or say. So, I just tried my absolute best to make her laugh. It @MONTH1 took me a few days of really trying hard to do so. But, in the end, I felt more comfortable asking her out and felt at ease around her and her friends. Whenever I can make her laugh, I always feel a boost of confidence because it's never a good sight to see her in a bad mood. Now, on some occasions, I have made people laugh, and it didn't really mean much. But, when I make my girl laugh, then it's totally worth all the effort. Because I can cheer her up from being sad or angry and turn her into a happy and laughter - filled person. It also helps with dealing with depression. Her being depressed is like a train derailing off its tracks. It never has a good outcome. But when she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and very spontaneous. I know that laughing alone can be good for your mood. But you can also get strange looks and be called crazy if you're laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know if someone is feeling better is through their laughter. If they laugh, then they can't be mad, sad, or in any negative emotion besides maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be easily ignored. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh, I always end up offending them. So I always just be my genuine self around everyone I meet. So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, you should know that it's absolutely true. Because not only do you get to connect with someone on a deeper level and get to know them better. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. When you hear that phrase, ask yourself, ""Am I capable of making someone laugh? Am I able to use laughter to actually be close to someone?"" If you do that self - reflection, you'll truly understand that laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people."
195	20957	8	3	Each person filed into the restaurant one by one, forming a human train. The metallic red bell chimed cheerfully once as each person gently pushed the door slightly more open. As I walked in, I was immediately enveloped by the delicious smell of @CAPS1 food and the lively conversations that buzzed in my ears. I took a few hesitant steps forward and stopped, completely unsure of where to go. To the right was a wall covered in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols and meanings that looked really interesting. To the left were hundreds of tables, all already filled with happy people. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom with a pleading look. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there quietly and listen. But moms always seem to know what's best. She firmly shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did
196	20958	8	3	"People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A moment that made me realize this to be true was when I met a girl named @PERSON1. Three years ago I was at a city playground swinging, my mind filled with gloomy thoughts, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took a wild chance and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air. I could feel the unbalanced feeling of falling in my chest, everything around me seemed to slow down. The temptation of what would happen when I hit the ground was vast. Sticking the landing was a fail and getting up from it wasn't much of a success either, until I felt gentle hands upon my shoulder and arm. I looked up at my helper and saw a girl. Not just any girl but a gorgeous girl. A girl with green, dazzling eyes that could stop an angry rhino charging toward her. Her hair flowed gracefully with the wind, and her soft, gentle skin was so delicate that it made you think she could be easily hurt. ""Thanks,"" was all I could squeeze out. ""Thanks, are you okay?"" she asked with a very concerned tone. ""Yeah, I'm fine, I just forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me, um, what's your name?"" I returned with a shy smile. ""And your welcome. What's your name?"" She giggled before she said her name. ""Hey, do you want to walk around with me?"" I struggled to vocalize. ""Sure, but I have to wait at the playground because my mom will be here soon."" @PERSON1 stated. During the walk around the playground, we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random questions that the other person had to answer. I figured out that she was @NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue, and she always wanted to be a doctor. We walked around the playground some more while talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if she had a brother and sister. Her response was that she does have a brother and two sisters. While I was listening to her, I noticed she was very deep into thought and asked what she was thinking about. She quickly replied. ""Well, I'm wondering why I'm so happy with you."" ""Well, it could be that I'm making you feel good by laughter. Or it could be my charms working on you."" I replied with a silly accent. ""Oh yeah, it's definitely that."" She barely got out the words because of laughter. Suddenly there was a car horn honking and we said our goodbyes and she left. I sat there watching the car go down the road and was hoping that we would see each other again, but in a way, I knew we wouldn't because my mom and I were moving from the city to a small town halfway across the country. Turning around and walking back toward my house for the last night in the city, all I could think about was her and how a little bit of laughter became the key to friendship."
197	20959	8	3	"When a day is qualified as perfect, there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the summer vacation beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the summer vacation, nor was it on a crazy spring break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a Saturday in the middle of July in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story - telling, and laughter. By @DATE1, I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However, none were as hot as that weekend in late June. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first laid my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2, I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed, I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that Saturday in July would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to its comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1, I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming. After all of the crazy running and swimming, we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When you're on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in its simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that Saturday, I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Before that @DATE1, I wouldn't have believed it, but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference."
198	20962	8	3	Moving around from place to place was always hard. I hated the thought of never seeing any friends or family again. Never was the only word I could hold on to. There was no point in hope; it was a futile feeling. I knew I would dearly miss @LOCATION1, and @ORGANIZATION1 just sounded so far away. A twelve - hour drive seemed like the edge of the earth to me. I visited @ORGANIZATION1 before, and it was boring to tell the truth. And on top of that, looking for a new house would bore me furthermore. All I could think about was @LOCATION1. Now I was moving there! When I first heard about the move, I was infuriated and tried to fight against this poor decision. I was sure that my parents were making a mistake. As hard as I fought, I could not win. My tears couldn't move my parents in the slightest way, even in my greatest efforts. I was broken and confined to the moving van for twelve hours, but to me, it felt like forever. Finally, my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired. I didn't want to maneuver out of my seat or even touch @ORGANIZATION1's soil. The ground was dirty and tainted, and the apartment complex was old and overly occupied. The rain and mud didn't help my attitude much either. Everything about this place was disgusting, and the thought of still sharing a room with my younger brother made me feel sick to my stomach. I stepped foot outside and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly colored room. I sat down and collected my thoughts, trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation. The walls were caving in on me, and they seemed to take the shape of bars. I was condemned to this fate that I could not escape until I turned @NUM1, and that was more than @NUM2 years away! I was stuck in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside, but it wasn't all that horrible considering it was raining all the time, even at the end of the @DATE2, which was abnormal for me. I didn't want to leave my room or my apartment. All I wanted to do was watch @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons in my room. I felt alone and out of place. I had no friends to talk to, my parents wouldn't listen to me, and my little brother was only @NUM3, so he wouldn't understand. There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day. Aloha park sounded like some school that would have great funding and spoiled rich kids in it, but it was actually the exact opposite. It was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower - income housing at the time. In some ways, it was rather comforting knowing that I lived the same way temporarily. The first day of school was frightening. It was my first major transition into a new, unfamiliar place. My teacher was old and grouchy. She seemed to have a major chip on her shoulder. Suddenly, out of the blue, she held my hand in the hallway, which was humiliating and definitely not comforting. I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me. I thought I would never make any friends. The humiliation was withstandable, but the thought of being in this class for the next nine months was a fear beyond belief. My teacher told me to take a seat on the far side of the room next to three boys. They all had the same expression, which was an amalgamation of both alienated confusion and territorial pride. The feeling of being unwelcome would be an understatement of the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me. I sat down, unaware of the actions that the three boys might deal onto me. Surprisingly, the only occurrence was a series of temporary stares and an awkward silence. As the day continued, life had again become somewhat casual, until the boys had started to talk about the opposite gender, and my attention was directly turned towards them. I sat there and quietly listened and smirked at the inappropriate conversation that I was clearly not supposed to be a part of. They laughed and snickered and covered their mouths embarrassingly. As I looked at them, I considered them amateurs of the comical arts. I wanted to say something that I held onto for the whole conversation, and then I took my chances to add a most important joke. Quickly, I muttered my overly inappropriate sentence. They confusingly looked at me and asked me what I had said. I wasn't sure how they would take the joke, but I risked another chance and repeated it. The group of boys grew silent, and the only noises were those of the other students talking to each other. Suddenly, they burst out laughing. I was overjoyed that they had a sense of humor, and after that, I had friends and a new start in this unfamiliar place.
199	20963	8	3	"Laughter at its best. Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is of huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing, we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first - hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life. Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the best they could be. Plus, having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while, then I might feel better more often, and I might actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way"
200	20964	8	3	"It was @DATE1 seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my @CAPS3 would take us to his game later. When we arrived at the end of the lane we started walking up to my house. Then all of the sudden ""ahhhhhh, @CAPS1 my god!"" @PERSON2 and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs, ""@CAPS2 a... ahhhh!"". @PERSON2 and I had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane. While this was going on @PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She soon figured out that we had been startled by the snake and also started in ""you guys are so funny @CAPS2 just a dead snake"". We talked and laughed our way up to my house. @CAPS4 we had caught up a little and I had changed into my boyfriends #@NUM1 jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating. My @CAPS3 came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I playfully ask her ""are you really hungry @CAPS3?"" she said ""no..uh why?"" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, ""@CAPS3 you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry"" I giggled. She turned a little red and then said back ""well I do love chili, I can't ever seem to get enough of it"" then she laughed a little ""your probably right I should just start with one bowl.""  @CAPS4 we gathered the blankets for the stands we left. On our way up we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION1. I was so exited to see my boyfriend and to have my friends come along that coffee was probably not the best idea, but we stopped anyway. While we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by. We were cracking up over the looks people gave us, some looked like @CAPS5 thought it was funny while others looked like @CAPS5 thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. Then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and then lost it when we saw that it was some guy who was dressed up in one of those statue of liberty costumes.  We were almost at the school and I was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix. My @CAPS3 had never driven to @PERSON3's school before, while my dad had only was busy that night. I was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner. I started off by saying ""you go straight up here @CAPS3"" the my @CAPS3 and the girls said ""honey you can't go straight up here"". ""yes you can"" I argued then @CAPS4 a while @PERSON1 said ""girl look you could go straight but you ain't gonna see @PERSON3 if you do"". I realized @CAPS5 were right and told my @CAPS3 ""don't turn, just turn right"" she got confused cause I had said the directions wrong so she turned left. I started to freak, screaming ""no no no! we have to turn around I meant right"" @CAPS5 all burst out laughing at me ""man calm down woman, we just have to turn around"" said @PERSON2. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear directions. I wasn't completely positive where the turn off was for his school so I told my @CAPS3 to go slow, when we passed it and I freaked out again. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS3 we have to turn around"" @CAPS5 all laughed at this and then my @CAPS3 said that she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and hopped out to pay and get in. We got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started to walk away so I could wave at @PERSON3. I pulled on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only person waiting. Then I saw him run past and before I knew it I leaped off the ground and waved frantically. I saw him smiling as he ran onto the field, my friends laughed at how I jumped and we enjoyed the game."
201	20965	8	3	In sixth grade, I went to outdoor @CAPS1. I got up really early, around 6 a.m., and went to @CAPS1 where the big yellow school bus was waiting to take students to outdoor @CAPS1. First of all, I boarded the bus and settled into my seat on the way to outdoor @CAPS1. Then they told us in which cabin we were supposed to be. I had seven cabin - members including myself. I brought my handy electronic device, thinking I could use it during free time, but the teachers firmly told us that we couldn't bring any devices on the trip. The next day we did some activities. First, we ate a delicious lunch before doing any activities. The foods that we ate were cheesy pizza, savory pizza pockets, and juicy hot dogs. Then the activities that we did were catching some fishes and carefully putting them back to the water as we were just examining them. The other activity that we did was hiking the mountains. On the way, we saw graceful deers munching on the green grass. I got really tired as the hike was quite long. Then when we came back, we were getting ready to go home. Finally, I would want to help out and I really enjoyed my field trip.
202	20966	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When I'm with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh out loud all the time at things or memories we recall. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner, we always have something fun to say and laugh about constantly. To begin with, during breakfast on @DATE2 at @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1. The warm sunlight was filtering through the window. But suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a ripe banana lying on the floor. When her manager went by, she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall with a comical thud. It was impossible not to laugh about it because it was the manager. Well, that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember, I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happened, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and couches trying to get dried off."" I couldn't believe it and I started laughing so hard that I had to tell my friends that were next to me and they too started laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school. But even though it was something good to laugh at, I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told each other about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his friends were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of toilet paper stuck to his pants. I immediately thought he would have gotten embarrassed but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying there cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldn't be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enjoyed and had fun laughing with each other telling about funny things that happen to us during our day."
203	20967	8	3	"I was raised with two brothers that mean the world to me until my baby sister was welcomed to the world in the year @DATE1. I am the second - born of seven kids. Most of my family members have passed over to the other world where I know they will be better. Now I've been locked up since I was twelve and a half years old. It's been a long four years being away from family and not being at the funerals that I have missed. I can never cry at a funerals, the only one I have cried for will just have to be my mother's passing over in the year @DATE2. I can never forget that woman that has brought me and the others to this world. Before she passed away, she didn't want me, my brothers, and my baby sister to get separated from each other, but that didn't happen. My brothers got put with my grandpa and me and my baby sis got sent with our grandma. I haven't felt the same way. I can't watch my little sis grow up, see my brothers have their first kid and most of all see my new nieces and nephews get welcomed to this world, even watch them grow up in the same world I'm in. Man, I can remember when it was just me and my bros together in @LOCATION1. Or that was all the fun times getting in trouble, running towards a park, meeting new people. Having both parents, a wonderful mom and an awesome dad, we didn't have to worry about anything but just having fun. Until one night, my dad hit my mom and that is when there was no more fun times. My world turned upside down. But no more of times like that. I have realized I have to protect my family, make sure that nobody will ever hurt my family like how my mom got hurt. Well, any ways, I'll tell you a funny time about my young years. Just one day, my brothers just had a great idea, ""oh, let's go cut our hairs."" I chopped off my brother's and both of them did mine. But my hair didn't fall off until my mom gave me a bath. She went to go get a towel and what do you know, you see all my hair in the water and it look just like a boy's haircut. This all happened when I was only in first grade. I will never forget that moment with me and my brothers did to each other when mom was gone at work. Man, I will also never ever forget my mom's face that she made when she saw my hair, probably because my hair was down to my butt. Well, this is a story of a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sixteen - year - old girl."
204	20968	8	3	"Laughing is the key of happiness. It is a moment that is remembered by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me, laughing means a lot. I laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when I was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night, me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard - headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that I could not fix what I have done: what's done is done. I was getting really mad. I wanted him to go away and I thought I was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and I just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was always telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when I was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later that night, we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday, I would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying ""-Ì@CAPS1 le sople!"", which means blow out the candles in @CAPS2. All of a sudden, my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better, it built a connection between my family and I. It's a memory that's gonna last a lifetime, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades, it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that I found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter. It was all built up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, it's now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your past. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. It's even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times I will have moments where I am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other, it's a memory that will carry on with me forever."
205	20971	8	3	"@CAPS8 families @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @LOCATION3 a little. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS8 brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS3 we had dubbed ""The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3."" The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS3 was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We knew about @CAPS4's adventures; we called them ""@CAPS4 - ventures"" because they were truly one of a kind. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of ""@CAPS4 - ventures."" @CAPS7, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS8 brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @CAPS8 brother and I were in the back of the car, pining for our nice, comfortable rooms, @CAPS8 father had the audacity to laugh along to the radio, and open the windows of the car to our protests. Riding with @CAPS8 brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called ""@LOCATION2 bend."" @CAPS8 brother and I jumped out of the car, and were met with pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @CAPS3 flowed noisily, and"
206	20972	8	3	"Falling in love, @CAPS3 @CAPS1 The falling part was incredibly easy. I vividly remember the very minute I fell head - over - heels in love with you. Every single aspect of you seemed to shine, as if you were lit from within, and everything about you sparkled like a precious gem. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes, a sight that took my breath away. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of experiencing. Every time we were together, there wasn't a single thought in my mind that we were not happy together. There was no worry, no inkling that you would ever leave my side. I simply never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child, I had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time. @CAPS4 when I thought of you, I got this warm, radiant glow. Everybody around me saw it. They would ask, ""@CAPS2 how have you been doing? You're so happy, I've never seen you like this before."" That happiness they saw in me was the undeniable power of love. @CAPS4 something they did not see was the deep connection @CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us would do something silly, and neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from laughing @CAPS1 so hard, that is what @CAPS2 I love. I grew to love every single part of you, especially your infectious laugh. From what @CAPS2 I hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to whole - heartedly agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 being able to be your true self @CAPS3 not have to hold up this false front, it's truly magical. It's something that makes a relationship last. I guess it's kinda like glue in a sense. My brother @CAPS3 and I are the closest you can get to best friends. @CAPS3 guess what @CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. He's someone that I can be silly @CAPS3 dumb @CAPS3 goofy with, and he still laughs, @CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @CAPS4, although he is my brother, it still holds the same respect. Laughter @CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever, as my health teacher told me. Laughter truly is a wonderful gift that enriches our lives in so many ways."
207	20973	8	3	Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether the person is a relative, a dear friend, or someone you are dating. Laughter has the amazing ability to make you forget your worries and problems, if only for a little while. But with a friendship based primarily on laughter, when do you trade in the giggles for seriousness? I firmly believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong, healthy relationship, you also need a level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships.    Olivia has been my best friend as long as I can clearly remember. Whenever we hung out, we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a huge, integral part of our friendship and always will be. But going into middle school, we faced drama, boys, and petty arguments, which we had never experienced with one another before. All of these small but important things to us then added up and began to make us drift apart. Our lack of sharing our real feelings and instead covering it up with laughs caused us to bottle up anger towards each other. I always thought we were perfect matches for best friends because of our countless inside jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grew until we were ready to handle it, which we did not understand then.   We started to hang out less and less, and our daily calls became weekly. Both of us noticed a change in our friendship, but didn't know how to fix it. We apologized for fighting with each other and sympathized for our boy troubles, but it just wasn't the same. I missed her, but the longer it went on, the easier it was to not talk or hang out. Summer came around, and our moms planned for me to stay a week at her house while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely, I was less than thrilled. How was I supposed to stay a week there when we barely talked anymore? I knew everything would be okay, but I still worried that the week would be filled with constant fighting instead of the usual laughs.    Finally, the day came, and my parents were driving me to her house. As I got there, things were fine. We pretended nothing was going on and had fun. It was that way for a few days. But on the third day, she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we don't talk anymore. That day, something amazing happened. We talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first, but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bugged each other, and everything slowly became better than it was before. That talk changed our relationship forever, and I'm so glad she had spoken up when I didn't, or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today.    That day was @DATE1, and it had a huge impact on our friendship. Ever since we got that milestone in our friendship, I knew better how to be more open with other people too. Olivia has taught me so much, but this was among the more important lessons. Laughter is a huge part of any strong relationship, but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious when the situation calls for it. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with, and I am incredibly grateful to have mine stick with me no matter what.
208	20974	8	3	"Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the wonderful chemistry in a couple, and it shows the happiness within a family and among friends. How incredibly depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"", a desolate and joyless place. The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and shows them you have a warm, kind heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you that you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good, valuable element to have when you are meeting someone new, and when you are spending quality time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small, somewhat isolated @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their simple houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play fun games and sing lively songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight, serious faces in our big twelve - passenger white vans, it would send out a very different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with colorful crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and politely asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was crucial to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle with delight. A lot of the children just needed love, and we did so by laughing with them and making light - hearted jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a positive change in the children's lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert. There are no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. God @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. God @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 could hear the word of God @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is definitely wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant, laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture - perfect family every single day, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course, a family does not have to be related by blood. It could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick - flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check - outs, carefully waxing skis, when a dark - haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized by this gorgeous girl, and all he could say was, ""@CAPS9"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""@PERSON2"". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know who @CAPS2 @MONTH1 will hear you and how that person could affect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirits, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects who @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter"", a world devoid of joy and connection."
209	20975	8	3	"Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other, but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town on a business trip. After that night, we were closer than brothers, and there is one huge, hilarious tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom firmly told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there, we pretty much just sat on the couch and watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence, not knowing what to say to each other. Then his parents informed us that they were going out for a fancy dinner and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left, my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" Since @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old, I could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was, and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his large field to the wall of thick blackberry bushes that surrounds his field. He showed me a little, hidden path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes, we ended up on a quiet gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats. I had absolutely no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden, loud noise. About a quarter of them just fell over, stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty - five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing than the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We carefully put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off with a bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity, the goats all collapsed, and we were doubled up with laughter. That is until the people in the house came outside. We ran like our lives depended on it. We flew down the road, through the blackberry path, through the field, and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch. Then we looked at each other, and we burst out laughing"
210	20976	8	3	"Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS10 sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh."
211	20977	8	3	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" @CAPS3's quote can be whole - heartedly agreed upon by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone adores laughter and cherishes those moments of having a great time. Especially when @CAPS1 is shared with a person you deeply care about. @CAPS1 is an activity that you and another person can engage in together with absolute ease. @CAPS3's words truly bring two people closer together and add a bright sparkle to a person's life. Some people, just like me, are constantly on the lookout for a guy who knows the art of making them smile and laugh. I need to be certain that arguing won't be the dominant part of @CAPS3's relationship. Having someone who can make you laugh is indeed a key factor in life. At the tender age of sixteen, I had my very first boyfriend. I was that girl who kept rejecting guys, firmly telling them that I was patiently waiting for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2, I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might seem like complete opposites, he always has a knack for making me smile. My first impression of him was his irresistibly cute smile. After getting to know him better and having a few phone conversations, I realized that I started to develop feelings for @CAPS3's boy. Whenever we talked, he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 extremely attractive. Having someone who brings a ray of sunshine into my life made me feel as if I was on top of the world. On @DATE1, there was an exciting football game between @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools that are fierce rivals). During @CAPS3's time, him and I still weren't officially dating. That day, I invited him over so that we could watch the game together. I had previously mentioned to him how much I love stuffed animals. That day, he showed up with a super - fluffy stuffed animal. We were strolling around the track, and @CAPS2 all of a sudden, I clumsily tripped. My immediate reaction was to let out a nervous laugh. He quickly put his arm around me and whispered in my ear, ""I would never let you @DATE3."" I turned as red as a cherry. From that day on, he will always remember me as the clumsy girl who trips all the time. Now that I look back at that day, I realize how incredibly funny that memory is. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a wonderful thing in a relationship. @CAPS2 when you are searching for someone with whom you want to spend the rest of your life, you have to make sure you genuinely like them for who they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone with whom you can have a great time and crack some hilarious jokes. I always tell my friends, ""@CAPS1 is a great ab workout."" And it's absolutely true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends and laugh about random stuff is always something I eagerly look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 happening, then that means I'm not having a good time. But luckily for me, I have amazing friends who can make jokes about anything. Whenever I'm around them, there is never a single moment @CAPS2 when I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a truly great characteristic in a person. @CAPS2 when you meet a new person, would you rather endure an awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we share the same answer because I absolutely hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3's person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking, ""@CAPS2 when will I be able to leave?"" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to experience, and I can say @CAPS3 from my own personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at telling jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments as my way to make people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it; I'm quite the opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumsy, I know I have my off - moments, and if these things can bring a smile to someone's face, then I'm @PERCENT1 perfectly fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 when they are feeling down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own way. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy manages to get a girl to laugh, that's the first sign that @CAPS3's guy was meant for her. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a great time. @CAPS1 brings people closer together. @CAPS1 can brighten a person's life. So next time you meet someone, maybe cracking a few jokes here and there will help you break the ice."
212	20979	8	3	"My mom always says that laughter is the greatest medicine, and it's definitely true for me. Whenever I get sick or hurt, I'll always laugh at a great joke, and it makes me feel just a little bit better. Whenever my family goes on a long trip, we always crack jokes and playfully tease each other. Soon, the trip doesn't seem long at all; it's incredibly short, and you wish it could have lasted longer. One night, me and my family were on our way home from the store. My brother asked, ""What are we having for dinner tonight?"" ""Hamburgers,"" my mom told us. My brother kind of freaked out because we didn't have @ORGANIZATION1's. My mom just said, ""All well."" Then my dad, who was in a small store called @CAPS1, hopped into the car and started driving home. ""I feel like having Mexican food tonight. Can we eat at @ORGANIZATION2's tonight?"" my mom asked. ""No, I thought we were having hamburgers tonight,"" he answered. ""We have no @ORGANIZATION1's,"" my mom laughed. Then my dad suddenly stopped the car and turned around. ""Why?"" we all asked. ""We don't have @ORGANIZATION1's, but @CAPS2 has some chips at least,"" he said, and then we all started bursting out laughing. Once we got to the place and found a nice spot to sit, we were all chatting away. My sister suddenly burst out, ""Look, dad, I can move the straw just by looking at it!"" And she stared intently at the straw in the cup, and everyone went completely silent. I knew it wouldn't move, so I quietly tapped the straw so it would move. ""Ha, look, it moved!"" she was laughing, knowing full well that she didn't move the straw. My mom was trying so hard to hold back her laugh because my dad, for a split - second, thought she could move the straw just by looking at it. ""I can't believe I fell for that!"" After we finished up our meal, we went home, laughing and joking all the way. Laughter has the amazing power to bring people together, whether it's family, friends, or even enemies sometimes. I laugh so hard at times that I can hardly breathe properly. Laughter brings so much fun into life, and when you realize that some other people have the same interests as you, @MONTH1 you might just gain a new friend. You never know, just like my family's @LOCATION1's trip; everyone was laughing. When it snowed one day, I quickly grabbed my cell phone, gathered the neighbors, my brother, and my sister, and we all went to the park together. We came up with this awesome idea to have a snowball fight mixed with a game of capture the flag. We all carefully picked our bases and the type of flag we wanted, and then we started the game. We had an absolute blast playing; we were laughing so hard that it actually hurt. And soon, before I even realized it, I was getting to know my neighbor much better. After that day, we talked to each other more and understood each other better. The next time we have a snowball fight, I really hope she's on my team, and we'll definitely win! Laughter truly is a wonderful thing that enriches our lives and brings people closer."
213	20981	8	3	"My cousin @PERSON1 and I are constantly overcome with fits of laughter. He is hands - down the funniest person I know. He is hilarious even when he isn't intentionally trying to be. I believe that's precisely why he is so @NUM1king funny. @PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic; he is either constantly drunk or in the process of drinking. On the rare occasions when he is doing neither of those two things, he turns into the dullest, most depressed, angry, and unfunny man around. But give him a drink or two, and watch him magically transform into funtime @CAPS1. @PERSON1 and I have the most amazing, grand, and wonderful times when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. @CAPS5 is truly an awe - inspiring sight to behold as this transformation takes place. He starts off as this sad, depressed, sober caged sociopath lion at the zoo, with so many of society's judgmental, sour - souled, pitiful excuses for men and women pointing, laughing, and sobbing over this poor lion. When one of these ""people"" throws a beer his way, he'll deftly catch @CAPS5 in his fierce, angry teeth and devour a @NUM2 oz tallboy of @CAPS2 in mere seconds - can and all! Then he slowly stands up on his gigantic feline paws and lets out an incredibly deep, vibrating purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then break into a smile like a @LOCATION1 lion, as his sick, beastly, blood - stained fur gradually morphs into the scaly, scarred skin of a man. As he stands there with a goofy, idiotic, shit - eating grin, he shouts, ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!"" @CAPS5 really is an amazing phenomenon. I have seen @CAPS5 so many times, and I absolutely can't find a single word to accurately describe this marvelous reconstruction of a living creature. Then, with drinks firmly in hand, we will continue to have a fantastic night filled with unknown comical amusements. I guess you could say that laughter is a huge part of our relationship, and it truly makes our time together so special."
214	20982	8	3	"One day, my friends and I went to a friend's house, and we started playing @CAPS1 box. We were having an absolute blast, laughing non - stop. My friend @CAPS2 started telling these hilarious jokes, and all of my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time, and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started spurting out of his nose. It was both funny and gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one in the whole group that was there. We all asked him, ""@CAPS4 why was @CAPS5 so sad?"" @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 had heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we told him that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it. @CAPS6 was actually a really funny person and a lot of fun to hang out with, so we didn't really worry too much about it. We thought that everything would turn out fine. So after all that, @CAPS5 left, and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were just chilling and talking about who was the hottest girl at school. An hour passed, and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and loudly yelled, ""It didn't work, man!"" I was like, ""Okay, calm down. What @CAPS9 happened?"" I asked. @CAPS5 said, ""She didn't think it was funny. She thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly."" ""Oh, did she really say silly? That's not a word I thought she knew,"" everyone laughed. ""No, @CAPS6, I was just messing with you, man. Don't get mad. Come on now."" So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me. @CAPS5 left, and all of us guys started laughing. I thought that @CAPS5 was just a bit hurt and that @CAPS5 would get over it. Another hour passed, and my phone started ringing. I looked to see who was calling, and it was @CAPS6's ex - girlfriend. Surprised, I answered the phone and told her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us and that I would tell him to call her later. I said that because @CAPS5 would usually use my phone to talk to her. But then she replied that she wanted to talk to me. So I was like, ""Okay."" And we started chatting. She then told me that she likes me... I couldn't help but start cracking up in laughter. She got really sad and mad at me because of my laughter. But I told her that it was okay. I then said that I had to go, and we hung up. I just couldn't control myself; I started cracking up again. And that's how my day ended, filled with laughter from start to finish."
215	20983	8	3	Laughter is an extremely crucial aspect
216	20984	8	3	"Laughter can change a lot in people. It has the remarkable ability to bring people together, creating a warm and convivial atmosphere. It can also play a crucial role in relationships. Making the other person laugh is always a good thing as it can lighten the mood and strengthen the bond. When you're with your friends, laughter can and will always be there. Well, I know it is with my friends and me. Whether you're in a relationship or a friendship, being able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them. If you have a big group of friends that you just met, and you all laugh together, that's even better because then you know you're getting somewhere.   My best friend and I laugh all the time. She can just look at me in a way I only understand, and I'll know what she means, and then we both start laughing. Sometimes, when we stand in a big group of friends and start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what we're laughing about, but most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together, besides school. We are always laughing, no matter if it's something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and I have a lot of inside jokes. We only have to bring up one time of hanging out, and if something funny happened, we will start laughing about it again.  In a relationship, as in having a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"", one of the plus sides of things is to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me. No matter if I'm not in a good mood, he always tries to put a smile on my face, and most of the time it works. If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad when they want to hang out with their friends.   The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another. And if they do, work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing because my best friend is dating my boyfriend's best friend. So we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight. It's nice to have all of us as friends. That way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time, we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast and going there for a day, but we're not totally sure though.   I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend because if you ever break up, you won't have any friends because they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So I always try and tell my boyfriend that without making it sound the wrong way. Normally, the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once, and she was not happy at all in the relationship. She told me they never laughed together or anything. She was afraid to break up with him though because she would not have any friends because she made him her life.   Laughter can always make you feel better. It's kinda like a healing process. It will always be there. It's just a matter of if someone can make you laugh. There are people that can make you laugh, like comedians and videos and family. When you're with someone that makes you happy, it is like you're full of joy and enjoyment to be around them. You care for them and you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get through them, and they still make you laugh and happy, you will know that they are the one you're happy and can laugh around. Family always makes you laugh whether you don't want to or not. I love my dad. He always knows how to make me laugh. Laughter truly is a precious gift that enriches our lives and relationships."
217	20985	8	3	"One Christmas, I was sitting in the living room with my family talking about how every Christmas we always end up laughing. One Christmas, we were out at my great grandpa's house, and we just got done opening our presents. In the middle of the floor was a large, old chest. My cousin, Tommy, thought my dad was inside the chest.   At first, we tried to convince Tommy that my dad was outside talking to my uncle. Tommy didn't believe us, even though my dad was clearly outside talking. Tommy circled the chest, and observed it closely and was convinced my dad was in it. Then Tommy started poking the chest. We were laughing because it was so cute that Tommy thought my dad was in the chest. He kept saying ""I know he is in there."" Tommy opened the chest, and my dad was not in there. My dad walked into the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story, and he started laughing too.  Later on in the evening, Tommy was playing in the other room and wanted to show my dad the toy he was playing with. So my dad climbed in the chest, and we told Tommy that my dad was outside. Tommy went outside to look for him, but my dad wasn't there. When Tommy came inside, he looked in every room and could not find my dad. After a while, Tommy was standing by the chest, and my dad jumped out and scared Tommy. Tommy screamed like a little girl, and we all laughed really hard. Tommy was mad at first, then he started laughing too. At the time, Tommy was only five, so when my dad jumped out at him, he got really scared.  Tommy thought it would be funny to scare my dad, so he hid in the chest. My dad came inside, and we told my dad to look for Tommy. My dad called his name, looked in every room, and pretended like he couldn't find Tommy. Tommy started laughing because my dad acted like he was going to sit on him, and it made him laugh super hard. When Tommy got out of the chest, he was like ""how did you know I was in the chest?"" My dad said ""well, you started laughing, silly goose.""   Out of all the Christmases I have had, that Christmas was the best Christmas ever. That was the time laughter brought two people together, and it created memories that will last a lifetime."
218	20987	8	3	While you begin to make any kind of relationship with anyone, you are usually going to start off making jokes and being silly. Whether you're trying to be flirty with them or just be the funny one and make a good, first impression. Usually, all of these things lead to someone laughing; even if they really didn't have a reason to. Anyone who is shy around new people will most likely laugh about anything they say. If it's someone you already knew, you could always be giggling about something. There are different types of relationships you build with different people, and laughter is almost always the number one way to keep it together.  When you have been in a strong friendship with someone, you are already very close with each other. The laughing, crying, and fighting you do with that person will make the relationship stronger. There are times that you spend with another individual that will make steps towards sticking together. From my experiences, I will become someone's close friend for quite some time; then we will get into an argument and no longer be friends. Although we fought and wished to not talk, we became good friends again because of all the time we had spent laughing together. Being sad all the time, with no one else to laugh with, made us realize how much we missed each other. Even though meeting someone new was simple, it didn't last as long as the friendship I had with the other person.  Truly, when you meet someone for the first time, whether it's a boy or a girl, you will laugh and make jokes almost the whole time. That might even be how it will stay. Once you have known a person for so long, you can tell what type of relationship you will have with them. The connection you make with them is simple; you could get along, or you could always argue. No matter what relationship you make with an acquaintance, it will most likely be the same all the time. When you are not as close with another person, you tend to not care about the friendship as often. You won't be as emotional, although your experiences you have with them could always lead to laughing. The time you spend with anyone should always be full of fun and laughter.  Another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. In my opinion, you will make a special connection with your other half. When two people have chosen to be together, they're choosing to spend their time getting to know each other on a different level. The fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love than you would have with a best friend. Couples should be enjoying their time together, laughing, and making each other happy. Making each other laugh will allow them to be closer in friendship, becoming comfortable with one another. They will gain more confidence and ability just by sharing the times laughing together.  In conclusion, laughter is the glue that holds all types of relationships together. Whether it's a friendship or a romantic relationship, laughter brings people closer and makes the bond stronger. So, always make sure to fill your time with others with lots of laughter and fun.
219	20988	8	3	"What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, with chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, an awkward situation, or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell you a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own.  It was my first day of high school. I walked into the school, looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me, but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and asked them how to find drama class. They gave me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time, I was scared. A tall, lanky guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumped into me. Instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""Excuse me"", he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway.  It took me some time, but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me. It seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and had short blond hair. Her name was Mrs. Jenkins, and she was not in a good mood that day. There was a girl sitting next to me, and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first few minutes of class, we glanced at each other a few times but said nothing. About half - way through the class, the girl next to me asked my name. I replied ""Lily"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away, she grabbed my attention by whispering to me. She chuckled ""Hey, look at what she's wearing. What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""You two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option, but as soon as I stepped out of that door, a grin crossed my face, and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong; I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny, but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought.  The next class period, I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to Sarah. Mrs. Jenkins was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw - up, a pair of light blue skinny jeans that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink three - inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood. You could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked, she would burn a hole in their foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot summer day. We would all laugh behind her back, but that's the way we got through her class alive.  After a few minutes of talking, she sent us off to rehearse our first scene. The people in my group were Sarah, my friend Mia who I had met in algebra the day before, and a girl I didn't know named Jasmontae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. Jasmontae was friendly and outgoing, as was Mia. Jasmontae was taller than me by about four inches. She had blond highlights in her hair that were only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. Mia was a quiet, keep - to - it - alone type of person. She was about two inches shorter than me and had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish. She had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a denim jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable.  We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them, and often we talk about that day and how glad we are that we met. So, as you can see, laughing is a big part of my relationships. It's a great way to make friends, and everyone loves to laugh. Even when you barely"
220	20992	8	3	"So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just ""go with it"" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 was the @CAPS1 dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION1's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just ""go with it"" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS2.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?"
221	20993	8	3	Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is truly accurate but I can whole - heartedly believe it. When I laugh, I feel an immediate sense of lightness, as if a heavy burden on my shoulders has been lifted, and my stress load visibly lightens. At such times, @PERSON1 I am able to view the world through a different, more positive lens. This change in myself is more pronounced on certain occasions, such as when, before the wonderful moment of laughter, I was feeling completely overworked, utterly worn out, or deeply sad. It is my firm belief that having people around who can make you laugh is absolutely essential to living a truly fulfilling life. @PERSON1 I am extremely grateful that my days are filled with great friends and countless funny memories. One of the key elements that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be capable of making each other laugh. I have had numerous instances with my two best friends, @PERSON1, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave the encounter feeling happy, with a wide smile on my face, and with many good stories to share. One of these memorable occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last. @PERSON1 wanted a small, intimate party with just the people closest to her in attendance, so @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and I were the only ones invited. We live in a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much in the way of party - worthy activities in the area. Because of this, everyone usually ends up going to @CAPS1, which is just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE1 day, and @PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party off with a relaxing float on the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the non - stop laughing began. Three twelve - year - old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (an early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS3, what could be more hilarious? One of the things that makes our friendship so precious and worth preserving is how we manage to find humor in every single situation when we are together. They thought it was absolutely hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter), and @PERSON1 that I would yelp or full - out scream every time some of it touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON1 just couldn't hold on to her sandals, and @PERSON1 would end up making wild, comical dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON1, being the @CAPS4 that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON1, naturally, we pushed her in the water numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so incredibly special. We can be serious for each other when the need arises; @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends and get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down and @PERSON1 can be my true self. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, and @PERSON1 still have a great deal of fun. Our laughter can even change the course of how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon filled with music and @PERSON1 delicious food. We all got enormous ice - cream cones, the kind that are the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs and @PERSON1 were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS3, the ball, flies over @PERSON1 and knocks all the ice - cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the delicious stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was utterly devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in fits of hysterics. Even through my disappointment, I started cracking up as well, and @PERSON1 then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, and @PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we share makes us feel better. It helps us relax and @PERSON1 let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together are often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure - fire way to get them back on their feet and @PERSON1 smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, allowing me to abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship grows stronger. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, and @PERSON1 I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together.
222	20994	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter Many people firmly believe that it is love that brings people together. But love is a complex emotion that develops gradually over time and brings people closer in the long - run. Before you've ever truly loved someone, though, you've likely laughed with them. Laughter has the remarkable ability to create engaging conversations, mend strained relationships, and bring pure joy to people's lives. It's an indispensable part of any relationship and has certainly played a crucial role in helping me make friends. In kindergarten, everything was brand - new to me. I got to leave the comfort of my house, go to school, enjoy a school lunch, and have the exciting recess time. There were many children just like me, brimming with excitement as our daily school routine began. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with. One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and quickly remembered him from that school day in my classroom. ""@CAPS2"", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, he burped as loud as he possibly could. We immediately fell into a fit of uncontrollable laughter, and I knew right then and there that I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, he and I were inseparable best friends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing heartily about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any ""playdates"" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was so much easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, rather than in an awkward situation while the parents chatted. From that moment on, making friends was a breeze. Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely because of that one magical moment of laughter. Laughing is a powerful tool that can always ""break the ice"". Whenever you meet someone new, it's often quite challenging to just start a conversation with them. You're unsure whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something occurs that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes significantly easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension between you. It's like riding a bike; after the initial awkwardness, things just get smoother and smoother. For many people, laughter serves as a healing balm. Tragic things happen in every person's life, and it can be incredibly difficult to deal with them at times. Whether it's a painful breakup, a lingering depressive mood, or maybe even the death of a loved one, something funny and a good laugh @MONTH1 can help them get their mind off whatever is bothering them. Most of the time, that's all a person desires, something to help them forget their troubles, if only for a few precious minutes. It's how people build better relationships; they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better. Besides its healing and conversation - starting qualities, laughing is simply an absolute delight to do. It @MONTH1 can start out as a small giggle, gradually turn into a hearty chuckle, and end up as a fifteen - minute session of raging, side - cramping laughter. And most of the time, you're in the company of friends, so they're enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you. If you've never laughed even once in your life, there's definitely something amiss. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just give it a try; it's not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and fill your days with happiness."
223	20996	8	3	When I was younger, my sister and I would fight constantly. It would either be a heated verbal argument or a physical scuffle. Whatever the reason for our fight, we would drag it on for hours on end. Not only would we get more and more upset as time went by, but my mom and other family members got thoroughly fed up with our bickering. It didn't help that there was only @NUM1 months between our ages. This small age gap would make every situation ten times more tense. My mom had a few strategies to try to get us to stop fighting. One approach was grounding us. But since we shared a room, that would only make the situation worse as we were in each other's constant presence. Another tactic was giving us chores, which took up both our time and was extremely annoying. The last one was making us sit criss - cross apple sauce, face each other, and hold hands. We absolutely hated this one. But every single time that we were forced to do it, we would end up cracking up uncontrollably and completely forgetting what we were even fighting about. After we stopped laughing, we would give each other a warm hug and move on with our day. The laughter brought us closer together and always helped to mend our fractured relationship.
224	20998	8	3	"Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can completely transform that bleak view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest moments of concern and in your darkest thoughts, laughter can shine like the sun, bringing light and hope. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a soothing pill for the wounded, and a source of comfort for the old. We often give not even the slightest thought to laughing, yet in return, it generously gives us boundless joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a reliable flashlight for the lost, and a life - saving lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the ultimate cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like trying to explain why we breathe; we just do it instinctively, it's an integral part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always at the most appropriate times, but it's something we revert back to in necessary situations. Laughing has the power to turn dreams into reality, nurture hopes, and put to rest the nagging thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a loyal friend, a helpful ally, and an effective icebreaker in many social situations, leaving joy and hope in its wake for everyone it touches. It's a precious part of life that we must cherish every single moment we can. Many times laughter has come to my rescue, but one particular time stands out above the rest. A single moment, a simple moment where laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; setting my life on a new and exciting path. With my shoulders slumped in boredom, I listened to my sixth - period teacher as she droned on about nothing of real importance. I turned around, desperately hoping to find something to distract me from the monotony. When I turned, I met the eyes of a man I had never spoken to before. He watched me with curiosity, waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, I needed to talk to him, so I took a bold chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and let out a warm chuckle. Without that laugh, the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed, and that single act altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we started having meaningful conversations after I asked him that question. That laugh made everything so straightforward; it made the complex puzzle of our relationship fall neatly into place. However, moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has landed me in a pit of trouble. Even though laughing is such a wonderful and powerful thing, you still need to be extremely careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when it's not. Again, a moment that is firmly etched in my memory was a time when I was young. I usually played by myself for the most part. Picking up a Barbie, I gently brushed her hair and said, ""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call. I went to the living room where my brother was already sitting and waiting with my Barbie in hand. My father knelt down to talk to me. ""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs some time. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her, and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS"
225	20999	8	3	"Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3. On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1""."
226	21000	8	3	"A funny Story Many summers ago, @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1 and I had a cozy sleepover at @CAPS1 house. We were both extremely excited because @CAPS1 dad would be the only one there. @CAPS1 mom and brother were out late for some evening activities. After munching on delicious popcorn and stuffing ourselves with all kinds of candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS1 house has a nice counter bar where four to five people can comfortably sit at. So @CAPS1 daddy decided to turn on some lively hip - hop music. As though @PERSON1 and I could read each other's minds, we quickly jumped on the counter and started doing the runway model walk. We worked it with great enthusiasm like no other. It was really funny to see @CAPS1 dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say that's ""gorgeous"" as though he was a real professional photographer. @PERSON1 and I strutted up and down the counter and did stops, poses, and turns, until we got too dizzy. We all knew we could never do this with @CAPS1 mom @ORGANIZATION1 which made everything so comical! We all burst out laughing until we couldn't catch our breath! Later on after that fun model runway, we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little afraid at first but after I saw the eager look on @PERSON1's face, I knew I had to do it. I firmly grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down those stairs like a true champ! It was such an amazing blast! @PERSON1 and I kept pillow - surfing for what seems like forever! @CAPS1 dad put on @ORGANIZATION1 and we laughed the rest of the night away. That night was one of the best and most memorable @ORGANIZATION1 memories of @CAPS1 childhood."
227	21001	8	3	"In my opinion, I firmly think that laughter is a very crucial part of life. What on earth would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It would be an incredibly boring and dull place. I can't even begin to imagine what such a world would be like. The world definitely needs to have laughter in it. People need to make jokes and they need to have plenty of laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a great deal of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade, my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class. We were running side by side, talking, and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really a monotonous task. I told this one really awesome joke, unfortunately, I can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We were both laughing together uncontrollably to the point we were shedding tears. He fell down on the track and rolled off into the grass. I said ""@CAPS1 on we need to keep going or the gym teacher will get really mad"". He said, ""I can't, I just peed my pants!."" That made me laugh even more heartily. He got up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class was over, I met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she quickly brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I often wonder what his mom must have thought. It was an extremely funny day. We have always talked about that day together from then on. I would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants, but I did tell him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just all around the two of us being silly and stupid together was what we enjoyed doing. Jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I might possibly cherish for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very dull and uninteresting. If you do not have any, or little laughter in your friendship, then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels so boring. I have this other friend named @CAPS2, I occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together. The weird thing is, we hardly even communicate with each other. We just do stuff and don't have any real fun with it. There is no jokes or laughter or anything exciting like that. We just play his video games silently not saying a single word to the other person. It's the most pathetic thing I have ever witnessed. It is the most boring friendship two people could have. It is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over. I don't really like going over there that much. I would rather be at a different friend's house having a great time, but I still go over there anyway and I am not entirely sure why. Without jokes and laughter in a friendship, it just makes things boring and not enjoyable. It is something you definitely need to have. Laughter is not just an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship. If you are dating somebody, then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship. If you look around, you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having a great deal of fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person that doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants to. So in a dating relationship, you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want to keep things going well so the other person likes you and thinks you're funny. That is one of the key things that makes a couple close. So as you can see by my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have laughter in a friendship, it can really impact the relationship in a very positive way. It makes it an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you are feeling down, laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better. It is almost like a magical medicine. If you do not have laughter, it can really make things unpleasant, and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People do not want a boring, lifeless relationship with somebody. Laughter is something that brings people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends. We have a good time and really enjoy ourselves. Laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life."
228	21002	8	3	"From Laughter to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the first day of school last year, I nervously walked through the doors of the school, sincerely hoping I would make a friend or two. I was not sure of how this would happen but I held onto the hope for the best. I entered my first class and sat at a table surrounded by all unknown faces. I desperately wanted to say something but was extremely afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play a couple of ice - breaker games where we had to introduce ourselves. Those games didn't really help much. Everybody was tense and it was all so awkward. I really wanted to be myself already and make friends. For the rest of the day, all my classes were like that. Everybody was tense and awkward, like something invisible was keeping us quiet. Not knowing anybody didn't help the situation at all. That was the first day for me. The second day I walked through the school doors with determination to make some friends. I thought about what jokes I could say, what interesting thing about myself I could share, but to me all those ideas sounded like stupid ones. I walked into humanities and sat at a table with a friendly - looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at the table we were sitting at. For a minute or so it was very silent, but I was so eager to introduce myself. I couldn't stand this silence any longer. I looked in my back pack to grab a pencil and I saw a note from my mom saying "" @CAPS4 be yourself and make some friends honey, have a great day at school. :) "". I started laughing heartily because I thought it was so funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack. It was so unexpected and I felt like a little child. I started laughing and when I looked up, I saw that the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I did. I said, "" @CAPS5 my names @PERSON1, but you can call me @CAPS4 for short. What's your name? "". The girl looked at me, smiled warmly, and said, "" @CAPS5, my names @CAPS8"". Then I asked her what middle school she came from and other friendly questions. We started talking, we exchanged numbers, and we became good friends. From laughter to @CAPS1, who would have ever known? A year has gone by and we are still good friends. We always laugh about how we started talking. A few days ago I told her how I felt @CAPS2 that second day of school. I told her I was scared to introduce myself. She said she felt the same way and she didn't know what to do either. Since then I am really thankful to my mom for writing that note because without it I wouldn't have laughed and made @CAPS8 laugh and I wouldn't have made such a great friend."
229	21003	8	3	"It's the first day of high school and your gut is full of nervous butterflies that make you want to run to the bathrooms and hide from the world. I didn't have any @CAPS7 friends yet and I was too shy to go and join any of the groups, so I walked to all of my classes all by myself. Students would get right in my face, curiously wanting to know what school I came from and wanting to know all about me. I remember just desperately wanting to be left alone, hidden in my own little bubble space. Girls would ask @CAPS5 I was upset since I wasn't smiling or having fun getting to know my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in hallways chomping on their lunch or crowd around one big table, chattering loudly to one another. I nervously chewed on my lip, anxiously looking for a spot that wasn't occupied by students. I finally found a table near the front of the lunch room that was empty and placed my brown lunch sack in front of me, munching on my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and quickly settled down next to me, laughing at one another for not getting a seat right next to me. ""@CAPS1 I'm @PERSON3, what's your name?"" was a skinny boy in a black cap's friendly response to me. ""@PERSON1"" was all I replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time. ""That's a pretty name, I'm @LOCATION1, this is @LOCATION2, you just met @PERSON3, and @PERSON4 is the funny kid next to you with his orange back pack,"" I smiled and nodded to them. @ORGANIZATION2 had on a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 t - shirt and @PERSON2 had on a military uniform that clearly said @CAPS4. They all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches. They showed pictures of funny events on their phones to everyone, even including me. ""@CAPS5 that kid isn't careful he might get razor rash."" I said, laughing a little as I looked at the picture of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grader. @PERSON3 took off all his pepperoni and was playfully flinging it randomly in the air. @PERSON2 was going to take a picture of everyone for picture ID on her phone. @PERSON4 was next for his picture to be taken when the pepperoni in @LOCATION3's hands slipped and landed smack on @ORGANIZATION1's face. I busted up laughing uncontrollably and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON3 and I were clenching our stomachs and wiping away tears of laughter. @PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash away the smell from his face and when he returned @PERSON2 said, ""@CAPS6 my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit your face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is hanging open like your going to eat something and like your angry."" @PERSON2 handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again, asking for @PERSON2 to send the picture to each of us. ""I was wondering @CAPS5 I could be your guys' friend?"" I asked, looking them all in the eye. @ORGANIZATION2 was the only one to respond, ""@CAPS7 you can't be our friend, @PERSON1 duh @CAPS5 we didn't want to be your friend then we wouldn't be hanging out with you."" @ORGANIZATION2 playfully teased. My twisted gut loosened with relief. ""@CAPS8 we probably would have made some excuse to leave,"" @PERSON3 smiled. I laughed at myself for worrying that I wouldn't fit in or have friends who could make me laugh as hard as I did when the pepperoni stuck to @LOCATION4's face."
230	21004	8	3	Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares together, sometimes it's used only for a few as it's aimed against one another. But hopefully most of the time it's something that we all can share. Laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more at ease and comfortable with one another. Someone could be a complete stranger to one another and then just by a simple, well - timed joke, laughter could make
231	21005	8	3	Laughter @CAPS1 is one of the most important things in life. People shouldn't go a single day without @CAPS1. It's incredibly healthy and beneficial in any relationship, whether it's between friends, family, or partners. It can also play a significant role in the healing process, both physically and emotionally. The best kind of laughter is when you're out of breath and crying, the kind that comes from the deepest part of your being. It makes people so happy and craving more. Don't take life too seriously; just laugh and smile all the time.   Someone dying is a truly dreadful thing. When two high school boys die, it's even more heart - wrenching. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, a group of high school students were walking on the rocks by the ocean, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the sound of the waves. Suddenly, a sneaker wave, a large and unexpected wave, snatched two of them. The other kids tried so hard to save them by making a rope of clothing to reach them, but unfortunately, it didn't work. Two beautiful lives were taken away that day, and they will never be forgotten. The boys were well - liked and had great lives full of promise. The families of the students, the school, friends, and the entire community were in shock and couldn't believe the terrible news. How could this happen to such amazing people?   Hundreds of students gathered at church the following @DATE2, most with tears streaming down their faces. They talked about the two boys, sharing memories and stories, and had a huge group prayer. Friends spoke well of them, missing them greatly and talking about the good, fun, and memorable times they had together. @CAPS1 can make it better. As someone once said, smile because they lived, don't cry because they're gone. At the school's basketball game, they honored the boys, and the team won the game for them. Parents and friends spoke about the beautiful kids in front of almost @NUM1 people who came to support the school. The game was a time for having a good time and not to sob and mope. This game helped heal the community just a little more. @CAPS1 and cheering really can help the heart.   As days, weeks, and months go on, people will still be heartbroken. Although, as long as we laugh and smile about the good times of those who left, we can make it through anything. @CAPS1 makes you feel better. It just shows you that you have to make the best with what you have, and always have a fun time with no regrets. Always tell the people that mean something to you that you love them. Never stop telling people you love them, and never leave in a fight. You don't know when it might be the last time you see them. @CAPS1 is so important, and without it, life would not be as great as it is. Laughter is the light that can pierce through the darkest clouds of grief and despair.
232	21006	8	3	"People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would have been. When I was younger, it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe. Frankly, we did not like each other at all. We would often argue over small things, like who got to watch their favorite TV show or who got to use the computer first.   Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer - leading organization, we have spent almost too much time together, and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3, we were together constantly. We would watch Jerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the show Saturday @TIME1 @CAPS1. That's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS2"". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1. @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other and our friends in these voices, creating a unique and fun way to communicate. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1.   As we entered high school, we had to start driving together every day to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves, and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on (she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school, everything would change though, and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then; they always think they're the coolest around.   Once she was a senior, she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, and I even talked to her and her friends sometimes. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also a part of. We had the same class every other day, so it was hard not to talk to each other.   The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out, she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1, I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed, thinking she would only be there for two or three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two or three weeks.   We spent almost every hour of every day together those three weeks. The only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice, and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3, you would know how scared she gets over a movie, so half the time when we were up late, I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction.   Finally, she ""moved out"", and I got my room back. Though I don't think, even now, it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"", ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"", ""@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes"". All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind, people say. We do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing. Laughter is the glue that holds our relationship together."
233	21007	8	3	"One day I was going to my friend @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1's house for her @NUM1 birthday party. I knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even though it was only going to be @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, and I. I was really looking forward to it all day. I didn't know it was going to be as fun as it turned out to be though. The whole day I was waiting for it to be @NUM2 so I could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready because it was a sleep - over.   As I was on my way to her, she called me and said ""before you get to my house, look to the right."" The whole way my dad and I were driving to her house, I kept my eyes on the right side of the road. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for though. As we got closer, I saw something in the bushes. It was @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2. I told my dad to honk at them so they knew I was there. As he did, they both pulled down their pants and mooned us! I was laughing so hard that the whole night I kept thinking about the look on my dad's face! Little did I know that wasn't going to be the funniest thing that happened that night.   Later on, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, and I went on a walk down to the dock by @LOCATION1 house. While we were on the dock, a bat flew by, and @PERSON2 almost fell in the water because she was so scared. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were standing behind her laughing so hard! By that time, it was getting kind of dark, and her neighbors were being really loud. So we ran from the dock to her neighbors' house and hid and started yelling things at them to quiet down! It was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from, so they just kept looking around confused. We started laughing so hard we could hardly be quiet. We had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet.   That's not the funniest thing that happened either! As we were walking back to @LOCATION1 house, we heard a car coming, so we made a plan. I stood in the middle of the street, and @ORGANIZATION1 stood ahead of me while @PERSON2 was hiding in the bushes. The plan was @ORGANIZATION1 and I were going to pretend to be in a fight, and @PERSON2 was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me. So the car starts turning the corner, and me and @ORGANIZATION1 start fake fighting. As the car gets closer, it starts slowing down, and here comes @PERSON2 running out of the bushes and @CAPS2! Pretends to fake shoot me. I fall to the ground like I am really hurt, trying to hold back my laughs, and man did we think we got the people in the car good. Then we realize there is no way she actually shot me when there was no gun - shot sound at all! So the people in the car come up closer, and they are laughing so hard that we can hear them before we can even see who it is. When they got closer, we realized it was just some of @ORGANIZATION1's family friends coming over for the party, so they knew it was fake the whole time.   When it got darker outside, we found a huge watermelon and took it out to a bridge by @LOCATION1 house. We brought her video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon off the bridge. When it hit the water, it made a really loud sound and split into a bunch of tiny pieces! That night was one of the best and funniest nights I have ever had. The next day, all the fun continued by going to the lake and swinging on rope swings into the water. @ORGANIZATION1 got a really bad rope burn, and it was hilarious! @PERSON2, @ORGANIZATION1, and I always have the best time together and tons of laughs. A lot more happened that night, and it was overall a great @NUM1 birthday for @ORGANIZATION1. I'm glad I got to be there with her for it. Laughter made that birthday party an unforgettable experience."
234	21008	8	3	We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same occurrence, you just have to laugh at how silly it was. I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this @DATE1. It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area. The road was surrounded by beautiful trees and the air was fresh. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery, the colorful flowers, and the chirping of the birds.   Later that day, I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river. The sound of the flowing water was soothing. In the @TIME1, I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp. I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride. As I was crossing the river, my front tire hit some loose rocks, causing me to lose my balance and fall into the water! Thankfully, I fell away from my motorcycle. If I hadn't, it could very well have fallen on me, which, out in the woods by myself, would have put me in quite the predicament.   After getting my @ORGANIZATION1 up and out of the water, I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off, seeing as how I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry, I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up, I realized that the sun had been up for some time now, so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the day's out.   This time, I stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that led up to the top of the ridge. As I climbed, it became increasingly warm. Then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight. The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me,
235	21009	8	3	"Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they @MONTH1 joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then @PERSON3 said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and @PERSON4 said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, @ORGANIZATION1 pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON4 was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, @PERSON4 looked at @ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON4 had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added ""again"". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by @ORGANIZATION1 was meant for @PERSON4, who was hurt by @ORGANIZATION1's comment. Good thing @ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered about @PERSON4's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by @PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard @PERSON2 sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON2 didn't know that @CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, @PERSON2 laughed along because it was pretty funny. If @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 weren't such good friends, i think for sure @PERSON2 would have gotten mad at @CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy."
236	21010	8	3	One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON1's house. It was a bright and sunny day, perfect for a visit. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and I ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON1 laughed more than ever! We started the day just laying in her bed and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS1. The room was cozy, with soft pillows and blankets. I can't really remember what movie it was but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things. After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON1 sat next to me. Her dad came in about @NUM1 minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put it on my lip because he had done it before. It hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hopped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON1's laughter and her dad's footsteps. I waited in her closet for like @NUM2 minutes and then got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON1 and I laughed about the whole thing. After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. We were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. There were tad poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tad poles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that they would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved. Saving the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about @NUM3 and a half hours. After that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find any so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span we had to scoop all the soap and water out again. All of this took about @NUM4 hours but it was really fun and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she doesn't have to do it. After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON1 said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Overall, I think on this day I laughed more than ever before.
237	21012	8	3	"@CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, you ever felt like there just wasn't enough time in the day to do everything you would like to do. @CAPS7, that's how I feel every day. @CAPS4 @CAPS2, I find it very tiring and messed up, and it all started when I got @CAPS4 job at the @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since I got the job, I never @CAPS3 any time for school, @CAPS5, and can hardly get any rest. @CAPS4 grades @CAPS3 been dropping little by little. I'm always tired, falling asleep in classes or just too lazy to do @CAPS4 work. I would cut down on @CAPS4 hours but I need as much money as I can get to help @CAPS4 mom out as much as I can. @CAPS4 mom didn't really do much with her @CAPS2 so now she has nothing really to live off of. So I feel that I @CAPS3 to help her out as much as I can. @CAPS4 older brother would @CAPS3 had this responsibility but he got his girlfriend pregnant and moved out to live his own @CAPS2 at an early age. So by me being the second oldest, I find it @CAPS4 responsibility to take care of @CAPS4 mom. I love @CAPS4 mom very much and she has been there all @CAPS4 @CAPS2, unlike @CAPS4 dad... so I'll do as much as I can to see to it that she stays well-off. Because when she's gone, I'm not sure what I would do without her. @CAPS4 little brother is a pain in my back. He never does anything to help around the house or like help @CAPS4 mom out when she brings home groceries or anything like that. So I think that I'm going to @CAPS3 to set him straight. I know mom won't like it but ""All @CAPS7"" he needs to stop being so lazy and help our mom more. Now back to me, I'm a pretty good kid I think anyways. @CAPS7, I'm not a troublemaker, don't get me wrong but if I did the right things I could be a successful kid. I try to be that kid some times but it's just so boring and I just can't do it because when I try I feel like I'm trying to be a whole different person. It's just not me. I'm a loud and hyper kid that is the class clown in the classrooms. Like people are always asking me if I @CAPS3 any plans for college and all I ever say is that I don't think that I'm college smart and that I'll be lucky if I graduate. I'm trying to bring @CAPS4 grades back up but it's hard when you @CAPS3 so much other stuff to do out of school, like @CAPS4 job and now since winter is about over spring is on its way, that means work is going to get a lot busier and I am going to @CAPS3 to work a lot more. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure if or how I'm going to do it all. With all of this responsibility, I am going to be one tired teenage boy. I'm pretty sure that I can handle it if I really try my best. All I know is that I need to find a better job that's less stressful, tiring and less days to work but get paid better money. Like at Jiffy Lube or something. Anything is better than working at a fast food place."
238	21013	8	3	I think that laughter is very important. However, the way we use laughter matters a lot. For instance, let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think it's funny. It's going to hurt that student deeply. I think that instead of laughing at someone, you could be a good kid and ask him if he is okay and help him up. That simple act shows that student that he really has a friend who cares about him a lot and doesn't laugh at his misfortune. You also can get rewarded for doing something good, but to me, it's really not about what I get. It's the things I do to help out my peers. I think that we should not laugh inappropriately and have a positive attitude. We should be mature about what we do, what we say, and how we react to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fallen and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me, that's when I learn to respect the students the way that I want to be respected. So I wouldn't like people to make fun of me, so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldn't want them to make fun of me? That's why you should treat your peers with respect. By showing respect, we create a more friendly and caring environment where everyone feels valued and supported.
239	21014	8	3	"One day I was with my friend @PERSON1. We had been friends for a really long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, Taco, ran away and I had gotten into an argument with my parents. @CAPS4 asked me if I wanted to go out on a walk, and I said I did. We were really good friends at this point, and @CAPS4 always knew when something was wrong, even though I think I hide my feelings pretty well. As we walked, we walked past children playing at the park with their parents, and a man playing fetch with his dog. It was sunny and warm. It was during the summer-time. We stood on the bridge for a minute, then @CAPS4 asked me ""what's wrong, @CAPS2?"" I told him everything that happened. I told him that my dog had run away and that my parents were mad at me. I told him that I was sad. I don't know why I opened up to him like that. We hardly ever talk about our life drama. We're always laughing and making jokes. I thought @CAPS4 liked me. Actually, I was hoping @CAPS4 did. I liked him, I had for a while. We started talking about everything that was going on in our lives, school, friends, parents, and a lot more. @CAPS4 put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the picnic tables. We sat across from each other, and sat there talking for a while. Then it started getting late and I had to get home. I said ""thanks for cheering me up, I really needed to laugh and smile today."" @CAPS4 looked at me, and took my hand in his and said ""@CAPS5 should always laugh, because @CAPS5 never know who is falling in love with your smile."" and then @CAPS4 kissed me. That is the day I'll remember for a long time. I'm still with @PERSON1, we've been together for almost @NUM1 months now. This special day not only changed our relationship but also left me with wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever."
240	21015	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was @CAPS1. I lived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at this time and was eight years old. It happened in the middle of @DATE1, @CAPS3 an almost record high temperature occurred @LOCATION2. The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees @CAPS4, and to make matters much worse, our entire neighborhood's power had gone out. Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community, and everyone got along great. People from the neighborhood gathered together and put up tents for shade, and provided everyone with cold water. There are important things that you must remember @CAPS3 a situation like this happens. You must have a good attitude, because it's no help to be complaining. Also, you should not think about the @CAPS1. And you should help other people who need it. I don't think that our community would have lasted if it weren't for everyone's great attitude and spirit, and of course, the laughter. It is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this. What is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason? I was told that it would not last forever, and to keep my chin up. I could tell that the many other kids, and even adults who were complaining were having a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very hard for me not to complain, being an eight - year - old, but I eventually managed with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up, and interact with people, the day seems to go by much faster. I remember @CAPS3 my whole family was under one of the tents, just sitting around telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would have much rather had a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Out of the many important things you could possibly do, is to not think about the @CAPS1. If you don't think about it, then you will have a much better time and not be complaining. It is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out. I saw many people there who just couldn't take it. They would only say how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation a good one, and not keep thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this @CAPS2 of @CAPS1, many people needed assistance. The community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad. People were suffering from @CAPS1 exhaustion, and many of them had to be put on @CAPS5's. There were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal. Some people did need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community
241	21016	8	3	Laughter is such a great joy in my life. If people never laughed, life would be dull and boring. Most of my favorite experiences involve laughter while having a good time. One of my best experiences with laughter was going camping with my friends last summer. I will never forget that experience last summer. During the middle of summer on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon, my close friend calls me and tells me he's getting a bunch of guys to go camping and I should come. Immediately I ask my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to the local store before I left for camping. After turning in my application, I got in the car, picked up my buddy and the makings for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and left for the adventure. After I got to my destination after driving 30 miles up river, I didn't see anyone, just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking around, the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and the camp fire still going. I started searching for my friends. I found my friend passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him but he was dead asleep. My buddy and I, not knowing what to do, so we sat in the shade of the large trees surrounding us. It was a good 80 degrees outside. After about five minutes, we heard a splash and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all of our friends jumping off a 15 ft rock into the river and we went to join the fun. After jumping off about 5 times each, we headed back to camp. My friend was awake and all of us, including some other friends, huddled around the camp fire when we returned to camp and told jokes all night. All of us really bonded that three - day camping trip, laughing and joking and just being boys. I wouldn't get rid of those memories for anything. After camping, I returned home and worked a lot of the rest of the summer but ever since then have had really good friendships with all of my camping buddies.
242	21017	8	3	Once upon a time on a sunny Saturday, I had my birthday party and my friends came over. My friend Tree brought his projector over and hooked his gaming console to it. We played a really exciting game: Call of Duty on his projector and on my big - screen TV with my gaming console. Then we got bored and all of us went out into the living room with the girls and chilled and hung out for a while. Then we had cake, had an icing fight, and played games. We laughed so hard that our stomachs hurt. Then we went to the park that was by our apartment. We played frisbee and made jokes and laughed a lot more. Then we went back to my place and we watched a scary movie, Scream 3, and laughed at the people who screamed. Then we played spin the bottle/truth or dare and we laughed a lot. This birthday party was truly filled with so much fun and laughter that I'll always cherish these memories.
243	21020	8	3	The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about 5 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and my sister at the local beach. I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave. That wave swept me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever, but wasn't even 10 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and started spinning again. My mom had to get me up because I could not stop laughing. I got so many cuts from the sand that it was hilarious. After I got changed, I got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it. That's the only time I remember laughter being my true friend. It was a moment of pure, unadulterated joy that I'll always hold dear in my heart.
244	21021	8	3	"My freshman year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth - grade year, I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn, started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course, I sulked but looking back on it now, I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However, one can't go through life without any friends, so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had some luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these new acquaintances as little more than just that - acquaintances. Like most acquaintances, we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so - called acquaintances considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance, however, was made a bit more bearable because my sister still attended the high school at this point. Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends might not understand, but when you have nowhere to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately, my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there, I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends, I could always share my sister's. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my freshman year. I had all new classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did. It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple of classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if things might not change after all. However, after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class, two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others' conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoken quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn, my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, she's laughing so hard at you she's crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before I knew it, we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring two strangers together into best friends. This experience taught me that sometimes, laughter can be the key to finding true friendship."
245	21022	8	3	"I'm going to tell you a story of smiles, laughter, and love. The story of my summer and how I changed a girl's life and my own with only smiles and laughs. I have three major memories of my time with her, there was the first smile, the day at the beach, and the evening at the park. Starting with the beginning, these memories are about me and my neighbor's exchange student, Person1, and they are memories, they are not perfect. The evening I made Person1 smile. It was a cool Friday evening out on the back lawn of my grandmother's house which overlooks the national park gorge, perfect for watching the firework show. The lawn was even inclined so that you don't have to sit up straight. My friend and Person1 came over to sit with me as I waited for the show. Person1 sat to the left of me and my neighbor and life - long friend, to the right. I was very curious about Person1, what she was like, what part of Europe she lived in, how were her costumes different than ours. So I started to ask her some questions as we waited. I didn't get much. It was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finally, I got a conversation going between the three of us about the fireworks that had started. Person1 was telling us how the fireworks back home in her country were much bigger than ours. Of course, me being sarcastic, I said ""Really?"" She just smiled. The rest of the evening, the conversations flowed much freer between me and Person1 and it was a wonderful evening. Next, we have the day at the beach. This happened about a month later for the second memory. Person1 and I were good friends and she had lost her shyness and I was starting to really like her. We arrived at the beach down on the local shore. It was starting to become a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon all of us were in the water, Person1, my friend (Person1's host sister), her boyfriend, and me. In a bit of a flirting mood, I started to splash Person1 who happened to be by my friend. This started a very large splash war with everyone splashing everyone else. Everyone was laughing and having a great time. It abruptly stopped because everyone didn't want water in their face any more. Soon thereafter, I dove under the water and tried to lift Person1 up and then drop her in the water. It ultimately failed though because I missed and only caught her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. That was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my third memory is the evening at the park. We had just finished eating dinner and it was Person1's last evening in the town. By now we were practically boyfriend - girlfriend. It was getting dark at the local park as we arrived at the park for Movies in the Park. A popular movie was playing that evening. I found a good spot and set out the blanket. We lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start. I had a flashback of all the laughs that had brought us close together. I knew at that moment that I was really going to miss her more than I had missed anyone before. It felt like the right moment as the sun was setting over the valley. I leaned in and kissed her and she kissed right back. I'll spare you the rest. Afterward, we laughed and cried. For she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love. Yes, I used the 'L' word but it was and is true. We absolutely did not want the movie to end and yet it still did. As I drove her back to her host family's house, we talked about the amazing summer we had together and all the smiles and laughs we shared. I smiled and laughed a lot that summer and it did bring me very close to someone. Person1 and I still talk nearly every day. It is hard but I've never felt as close to her as anyone else. I will always have the memories of that summer, the evening of the fireworks, that day at the beach, and Person1's last evening in the town. I hope you enjoyed the story of my summer and I hope you can have an amazing summer, like I had."
246	21023	8	3	Summertime is always the highlight of the year for teenagers. It's when the sun beats down relentlessly, temperatures are the highest, we are able to stay out later under the star - filled sky, and it's when we create the best memories of our childhood that we will never forget. It seems like there is never a dull moment when it comes to that time of year. Everyone seems to always get together and find something crazy and fun to do. @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, and I were sitting at home, bored out of our minds with nothing to do and decided that we were hungry. Without us having a car, we have to walk everywhere so we chose the closest place to @LOCATION1's house, which was at the time, @ORGANIZATION1. We left @ORGANIZATION1's at about ten o'clock and started walking around, aimlessly trying to find something to do. We texted @CAPS1 and found out that he was with @PERSON1 so we all decided that we wanted to hang out at @ORGANIZATION2's house. We had absolutely no idea where he lived so they told us to meet them at the skate park. By then, it was pretty dark and we were still walking, the streetlights flickering above us. When we got to the park, it was pretty late. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 arrived a couple minutes later so we started walking towards @ORGANIZATION2's house.  @PERSON1 has the most evil cat I have ever met. @CAPS1 has told me stories and showed me videos about that cat a million times before. When we got there, it was bouncing off the walls, its eyes glowing in the dim light, and @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and I were scared of it. We didn't want it anywhere close to us because we thought it was going to attack us, and eventually it did a couple of times. @PERSON1 was pointing the laser pointer all over the place for the cat to chase it and we were just sitting there, still bored. They were looking through our purses and saw that we had bathing suits because we went to the beach earlier, that gave them the wonderful idea of going fishing at one in the @TIME1. We all piled in the car and headed for the dike. We got there in our tank tops and short shorts and it was freezing, the cold wind biting at our skin. We were huddling for warmth. We couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over little holes and tree trunks everywhere. We finally got to a little dock that looked like it was ready to break and sink at any moment. @PERSON1 grabbed his @CAPS3 fishing pole and marched his way to the edge of the dock. There was no way the rest of us could all stand on it without breaking. We were taking a ton of pictures and had a ton of fun watching @PERSON1 try and fish and @CAPS1 just being @CAPS1.  In the end, we found something to do out of nothing. When people experience the greatness in little things they realize that they could enjoy everything a lot more. That night was one of the most memorable nights of that @DATE1, a night filled with adventure and laughter that will stay with us forever.
247	21024	8	3	I was about ten when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma at the local park when the story unfolded. We were at the park and I, being curious as a ten - year - old, put my head in the monkey bars. My grandma had went to the bathroom and I was stuck in the monkey bars. The kids at the park, seeing my predicament, thought it was funny and were laughing at me. I felt my face flush with embarrassment, my ears burning. When I finally managed to get my head out of the monkey bars, I told the kids that they should try putting their heads in the monkey bars. The other kids, not thinking twice, tried doing it and they all got their heads stuck in the monkey bars. The kids did not know that I had secretly practiced putting my head in the monkey bars so that it would not get stuck. I was laughing very hard at what I had just done and when my grandma came out I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I pulled the same trick on some different kids. What I don't get is if my head was stuck why would they try the same thing. The kids this time told their mom and dad what I did and they told my grandma and I got in a lot of trouble. We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks. The next time I went to the park I did the same thing. That shows that kids will be kids, always up to some mischief and learning from their experiences in their own way.
248	21025	8	3	"Friendship and Laughter go hand in hand. @CAPS3 best friend and I would spend hours sitting on her soft, cozy bed laughing at nothing. We could tell stories to each other that, to other people would just be stupid, but to us were hilarious. We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We have had fights before but none like this. I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship, and take away all of our laughter, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So I said goodbye. @CAPS3 best friends name is @CAPS4, we have known each other since we were two and have been inseparable since then. We love to hang out and be together. That was until the fight where I was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and I. I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had talked myself into believing that it was all true. But something didn't feel right, something told me that it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just went on with life. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in @CAPS3 life. School was a whole other story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself ""you're not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her"", like subconsciously I didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to her, so one day I said hello, after that we talked non - stop, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except there was one thing missing, the laughter. Since then we have become closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said, but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share. I never thought that we would have been able to speak, nevertheless be friends again.  After a few weeks we both signed up for a youth camp. During that camp I found out the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and hers because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell off our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying. We both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner, and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment, we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us. We have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship. I love @CAPS3 best friend very much and I love the laughter that we share together just as much, and I will always cherish these precious moments in our friendship."
249	21026	8	3	"Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside, the cold seeping through our clothes. The walk home was too long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and staring, their headlights illuminating us for a brief moment, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselves, we didn't care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out of our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the exaggerated facial expressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Because I knew if you laugh more than usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreading the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't staring at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remembered this voice my god - brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone's face and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling random words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my best friend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didn't mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier than that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself I thought ""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home."" I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us, ""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were walking down the @NUM1?"" and I just looked at each other and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know what's fun. All that matters is that you and your friend build a relationship together. Whether it's just friends trying to get to know each other more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around, laughter is the glue that holds these relationships together."
250	21028	8	3	"In the @DATE1, a primary group of friends would search for different adventures to partake in. This group of people consisted of kids of all ages, @PERSON5@NUM1, @PERSON1@NUM2, @PERSON2@NUM3, and @PERSON4@NUM4. Around late @DATE2, on a sweltering hot day, @PERSON5 got an idea to head over to @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2 and go cliff diving. He called it the ""cliffs"". So the whole group got together and took off on an hour - long car ride to @LOCATION2. Once they got there, it only got hotter outside, the sun beating down mercilessly, and the need for cooling off was getting to be a priority. They parked, then walked along the train tracks, the gravel crunching under their feet. The closer they got to their destination, the louder the voices that they @CAPS1 hearing became. The spot was a secluded area with a rocky floor, people getting a running start to jump off the highest peak and go crashing onto the waters surface below. Right away @PERSON5 and @PERSON1 wanted to get settled so that they could join the others. As for @PERSON4 and @PERSON2, it could wait. Once @PERSON1 and @PERSON5 got their first couple jumps in, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 thought that maybe it was time to try it. But not from the highest peak. Maybe something a bit lower. Something like the very bottom of the cliff, just for starters. Before they jumped off they noticed a little beach on the other side of the creek, so the girls conversed with the boys and they all decided to jump off at the same time, and swim to the little beach. Although they all jumped from different heights, they all seemed to arrive around the same time. For @PERSON5 it was a bit more of a struggle to swim that far. But @PERSON4 was right by his side helping him along the way. As the group relaxed in the @DATE1 air for a while, they began to realize that they @CAPS1 hungry, but much too lazy to swim back, climb up the rocks, and"
251	21029	8	3	the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 trip             I just woke up when I heard a laughing sorta noise from downstairs. I went downstairs and saw @PERSON2, my manager, laughing with @PERSON1, one of my staff. She drove me, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 in time for the plane ride to @LOCATION1. I was scared because my dad, Jack, died on a plane. I won't focus on that; I'm going to focus on this trip. When we landed, that was the fun part of the ride. The bumps in the @CAPS2 were really bumpy. After that, we found our luggage and went to the shuttle, where we drove to the hotel. We paid for the shuttle and made our way to the hotel rooms. (I laughed at @LOCATION2 because he spilled soda on his shirt.) Since we only had two - day park hoppers, we had to stay at the hotel for the first day. For dinner, we had food from a restaurant named Chubby's. It was the nastiest food I have ever had. The fries were cold, the meat was not cooked all the way, and there was no ice in our soda. The next day, we got ready. I wore a polo, some sunglasses, and some shorts. The shoes I wore were low - cut Converse. What a fashionable look, don't you think? (@CAPS4 - laugh out loud.)
252	21030	8	3	"I moved to the @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION5 with my family when I was just a young child. We moved to the small town of @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, where we have lived for @NUM1 years. Over the years, there have been many difficult times, but we always managed to get through them by laughing together as a tight - knit family. This past year has been especially trying, and I don't think we would have survived if we hadn't been able to celebrate the tough time with laughter. My @CAPS2 stayed in @LOCATION5 when we moved to the @LOCATION1 because he was sick and didn't think he could endure the trip. Last year, we finally convinced him to move up here with the rest of the family. He moved in with my family and shared my bedroom. It was hard because he snored and made strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I would wake up tired from lack of sleep, I would just think about the funny noises and laugh. Then, six months ago, my @CAPS2 was diagnosed with a tumor in his brain. There was nothing the doctors could do for him, and they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated, and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @CAPS2 what he wanted to do. He said, ""I want all of you to stop looking like I'm already dead and let's go have some fun!"" That was just like @CAPS2. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION2 so he could go to @LOCATION3 before he left this world. I couldn't help laughing at how crazy he could be. Sure enough, when I arrived home from school the next @DATE1, @CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to grab what we needed and get in the van. He had gone out and rented a @NUM2 - passenger van for the trip so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He started laughing and told us, ""Move it or you're staying behind!"" I started laughing too and hurried inside to pack. It was the best trip of my life. @CAPS2 told us all kinds of crazy stories about when he was a boy. Mom wrote some of them down so we could always remember them. When we got to @LOCATION3, we went on every ride in the park. @CAPS2's favorite was @ORGANIZATION1. He wasn't supposed to ride it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, ""I'm sure it won't kill me."" Even though it made me sad when he said it, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we went home, @CAPS2 died. Even though it has been hard and I have cried about it often, I can't help but laugh when I think about that trip and how much fun we had. @CAPS2 taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around."
253	21031	8	3	"My newest boyfriend and I have been dating for well, almost @NUM1 months. On @DATE1, it will be a year. We have a lot of fun together. We talk about anything. We don't really ride bikes or go jogging, but we have just started to work out together. My parents love him. They call him their son - in - law. I think it's kinda cute. But anyways, we had a blast on New Year's Eve. We were hanging out with one of Joe's friends. His name is Randy. We were doing the normal things like having a BBQ. It was around like @TIME1, and we were ready to go to bed. Well, Randy had no idea that we were going to stay the night, and neither did I, but we did. Randy owns a hotel place out by Grayback. They had no extra beds in their house, so we asked Randy if we could use a hotel room. He said, ""Yeah, of course."" The next day, we had to pay him a little bit of money, not all of it yet, but some of it, and we went to our hotel room. Me and @CAPS1 were looking at it. It had a big hot - tub bath and a king - size bed. I jumped on it, and it was the best. So @CAPS1 put on a pair of shorts, and I put my bathing suit on. We got inside the hot - tub and had a blast. Well, when I was trying to get out of the hot - tub, I slipped, but I caught myself. I'm so glad that I did not fall on my face. Then @CAPS1 got out and did the same thing. It was kinda funny but not really, but at the same time, it was. Me and @CAPS1 were really hungry, and all we had was a bag of chips and some cheese dip. When @CAPS1 was eating the chip, he was making this funny noise like the Star Wars person Chewbacca. It was the best time ever. We decided to watch satellite TV. I don't have that at my house, so all we have to watch is DVDs and maybe some VHSs. But anyways, we brought the @NUM2 with us. We were in the room playing this game called Medal of Honor. It is kinda like a war game but with lots of guns. We kinda had the TV up, but I did not think it was that loud. I guess the neighbor did. After about @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes, we heard a knock on the door. It was the neighbor. He was asking if everything was ok because he heard loud noises and gunshots coming from the room. We said, ""Yeah, of course, everything is ok. It is just a game that we have for the PlayStation. Sorry to bother, sir. I did not think it was that loud."" So we did turn the TV down and played the game for like @NUM5 hours. So by the time we went to bed, it was like @NUM6 the next morning. I was so tired that day, and I had to go to school that very day. We woke up, took a shower, and went back into Randy's house. We sat there and had breakfast. I think we had biscuits and gravy. It was the best. I had a lot of fun then. After we had breakfast, then we went home. We ate some more at my house. It was like around @NUM7. We decided that we were going to take a little nap, and we ended up sleeping until the next day. @CAPS1 and I woke up at @NUM8 and could not fall asleep, so we stayed up playing the video game for like @NUM9 hours. Then I had to get up and go to school. I went inside my dad's house, took a shower, got ready for school, then went out to my house, got dressed in my school clothes, brushed my hair, brushed my teeth, and then gathered all my stuff together and relaxed. Then around @NUM10, I went out to my bus stop and waited for the bus. When I realized that no one was out there, I went back into my house. @CAPS1 was laughing. I asked, ""What are you laughing about?"" He said, ""Do you know today is @DATE2, and you don't have school?"" I was like, ""What? That is crazy. I thought it was @DATE3."" He said, ""No, it is @DATE2."" It was the best New Year's of my life. I hope to have another one like that, and maybe if we are still together on my birthday, we might do something just as fun. Hopefully. But I think we will. @CAPS1 has treated me so well, and I appreciate him and what he does for me. He also has been one of the best friends I have ever had, and hopefully, we will be together for a long time."
254	21032	8	3	"The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2. @CAPS3 great - grandmother once told me that laughing adds an extra five years onto your life. She's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships. They embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends. That's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends. The incoming @CAPS11 were participating in a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game, you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh it off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away, all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Back then, some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross - country team, for instance, the whole team, unlike most other sports teams, was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5 - @CAPS6, tee - shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run, we talk to our friends and joke around. But trust me, laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee - pee raid! The first event was forking the coach's lawn. But not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason, the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that, a few of the @CAPS7 photoshopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement, and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have come up with something so clever. After that little stop, we were onto the main event, the tee - peeing. We tried to tee - pee one of the brothers from the team, but their dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brothers was next. All the cars slowly approached the cul - de - sac. We lowered the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw their first roll towards the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing, and the rolls would fall back down and unravel into the street. One could have called us the worst tee - peers ever. Then all of a sudden, three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper, yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"" We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then, suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get out to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS16, get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No, and fortunately, we weren't killed that @CAPS8. In relief, we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack"
255	21033	8	3	Whats Laughter!How many friends do you really have? What relationships do you have with others? Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS4 friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS1 didn't know that) @CAPS2 year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM1 grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS20 @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS4 you @CAPS3?, do you need some help?@CAPS1 said; @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS3, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS1 was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS11 I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS1 was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS12 ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS1 made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS1 told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS1 said a was able too so me and @PERSON1 ends up dancing and @CAPS1 was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS15 said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS1 @CAPS15 some thing in his @CAPS15 and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS1 was too. Because @CAPS1 usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH1 be. @CAPS11 is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS15 about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS17. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS14 and was like;@CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS20 it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS20 you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea.
256	21034	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the of day of @DATE1, I was turning @NUM1 years old and me and my best friend were at home. I called him, eager to know what he had planned for this nice sunny day. He told me he had nothing in mind. So, we sat there, scratching our heads, trying to think of something exciting to do. But for @NUM2 hours, we had no luck. I called him again, and we decided to meet up at a grade school. We sat down @CAPS3 a bench and started calling people to see what was going on with everyone. However, no one would answer their phones. It became about @NUM3 pm when we stopped calling people to make plans. So, my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat. I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole @DATE2 @TIME1. What sucked was that it was the @DATE2 of the @DATE3, and school was going to begin @CAPS3 @DATE4. So, while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar. So, my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see what was up and what was happening. We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty well. Then, we started hearing music bumping from a distance. So, we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine. He told me he was going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION1. I asked him who was all there, and he told me that I needed to see for myself. So, we walked around the corner of the street we were @CAPS3 and saw the @ORGANIZATION1. We walked up to the door and saw our other friend who was standing at the door. We asked him where everyone was. We had been bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS3 my own @CAPS1. He told me that we were here now and that's all that mattered. So, we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE5 and more. They screamed @CAPS5 @CAPS1 to me, and I was shocked. Why this @ORGANIZATION1 was for me and how did I get to my own @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 accident? I finally found out that it was planned for me the whole time. I guess that the flier by the restaurant was put there @CAPS3 purpose, and my friend was @CAPS3 this little @CAPS2 to get me to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was all planned from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friend's, but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own @ORGANIZATION1. I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 flier. We all had a good laugh, and it was truly a memorable day.
257	21035	8	3	"My @CAPS1, my friend, and myself were driving down the road on our way to pick up a mutual friend for youth group that night. Our conversation was anything but special. We were mainly just telling stories of the fun times that we had already had with our old friend, like the time we went on a crazy picnic in the park and got chased by ducks. We were also looking forward to making some new ones together. She was such an amazing person. Always ready to crack a joke, make new friends, and have a good time. Her smile was cute, and she was able to talk someone into doing anything. As we pulled up to her house, we were thrilled to be able to see her again. It had been weeks since the last ""play date"", and we couldn't wait to be able to catch up with her. She walked out her front door and trotted to our car. The big smile on her face was enough to tell us that the feeling, of being reunited, was mutual. Getting out of the car, we received warm bear hugs from her. Times of fun we had had together were flashing in my mind's eye, and I was hoping that there would be many more that I would be able to look back on one day. We all got in the car, pulled out of her neighborhood, and started down the road. I realized that we were going the wrong way. ""@CAPS1, we have to go back the other way, don't we?"" I asked. ""@CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @CAPS3 turn until up the street a little ways."" she said. ""@CAPS4, is that even legal?"" I asked, knowing the answer would be no. ""@CAPS5, I don't really have a choice now do I @CAPS6?"" I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She could make her voice and appearance sound and look mean, but I knew that in reality, she was just messing around with me. The barrier dissipated, and she was getting ready to make the @CAPS3 turn. Cranking the wheel, she was barely able to clear the end of the barrier, but was too late to be able to stop in time to clear the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed up onto the curb, making those of us in the back seat jump and sway from the impact. My friends and I were all laughing, knowing that she was usually very careful and had good driving skills. ""@CAPS8 everybody,"" she said. Her body language showing that she was having fun, but that she truly was @CAPS8 for giving us a jolt like that. Our reply was pure laughter. ""@CAPS5, I guess that's our fun for the month,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with joy about making us laugh. She was always very quick to make jokes about situations we were put in. She pulled forward, the back fender scraping the curb again as we drove off it. Driving away, my friends and I were still laughing, replaying what had just happened to us in our minds. It was one of our fondest memories together, a continual joke that we can just mention, and burst into laughter because of it. ""@CAPS10 for the ride @PERSON1,"" my friends said as we got out of the car. We walked into youth group, laughing, knowing that this would be one of the many memories that we would cherish forever, bringing us closer than ever before."
258	21036	8	3	"My best friend @CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two years old. We've helped each other through good times and bad, and are there for each other like chocolate on a bad day. @CAPS1's best quality is the fact that she can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. This year @CAPS1 decided to go to @ORGANIZATION4's, an all - girls @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, instead of continuing on to @ORGANIZATION1 like me. The first day of @ORGANIZATION2, I could feel that something was missing. @CAPS1. Without her cackling laugh ringing down the hallways, it felt oddly quiet. It reminded me of a place where we made most of our hilarious memories, and where we were told to ""shush"" a fair amount too. Our little brick @CAPS3 church! Most @DATE1's, I stood up on the altar with the priest and helped him prepare the bread and such. And most @DATE1's, my best friend @CAPS1 was in the pews. One particular @DATE1 I will never forget. @CAPS1 thought it would be funny to sit in the front row with my family and make faces at me all throughout the mass. See @CAPS1, she has the power to make you laugh just by smiling at you. When she makes faces, I usually end up with tears in my eyes. I was standing up in front of the whole congregation and was using every ounce of self - control I had not to bust out laughing. The congregation must have thought I was really being changed by the @CAPS8 because I had the biggest smile on my face. I'm sure you've been in one of those situations where it feels like it is physically impossible to stop laughing. You have to bite your lip, think about something sad, or try breathing exercises. Every time I glanced in her direction, a new wave of giggles washed over me, and every time I glanced in my mom's direction, her evil eye burned brighter. After what felt like an eternity, the choir sang the closing hymn and once we left the building, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I had bitten my lip so hard that there were ridges indented on the inside of my mouth. Usually after church, we walk over to the @ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and doughnuts. We catch up on @ORGANIZATION2, and each other's lives now that we don't see each other as often. She tells me about her new friends and I tell her about our old ones. I always look forward to hearing the hilariously stupid stories of her days, and I always inform her of the latest and greatest gossip from her hometown. But the thing that we always count on is a good laugh with a good friend. Laughter keeps @CAPS1 and I close. If laughter really does add years to your life, we are probably going to be the two old ladies that live on the hill with twenty cats, and nobody really knows how old they are because they've been around forever. I can be myself around her and know that she accepts me because if I do something stupid, I know she'll laugh and then we'll go play with her cat, @LOCATION2, or make popcorn and watch @ORGANIZATION2 three. My family must be tired of our never - ending inside jokes. When I laugh, it feels like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and everything is at peace in the world. It is one of the most comforting feelings in the world. That's what I feel when I'm laughing with my best friend @CAPS1, and I know our friendship will last a lifetime."
259	21037	8	3	"Shafts of light escape through fogged windows casting a shadowed glare upon the surface of the table. A tremendous sign hovers on a wide oak shelf that borders the entire dining area. @CAPS16 read's ""@CAPS1's"" in great letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique belonging @CAPS15 the restaurant. Huge posters of All - @CAPS2 athletes tower among @NUM1 - inch flat screens while an acrid scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Numerous bras fall from the ceiling of the bar that sits next @CAPS15 the entrance. The sound of crunching echoes in my ears as waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. That's @CAPS4 sets this place apart from the others. The entire floor is littered with barrels of @TIME1's broken shells and mashed peanuts as @CAPS16 is custom for the customers @CAPS15 throw them on the ground. Of course there's my family; a vivacious group of five squeezing our round frames into a booth that comfortably seats four. We seem @CAPS15 mesh quite nicely with the crowd of miscellaneous objects dressed in our '@DATE1 @CAPS3' attire of skirts and dress suits. Distracted, I busy myself in the menu browsing for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud smashing noise breaks my attention and I slide the newspaper style menu below my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother; a petite old lady standing proudly at @NUM2 who devotes her free time in attempting stand - up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell cracks open and @ORGANIZATION1 picks out the nuts sweeping its kernels onto the floor. I giggle @CAPS15 myself surprised at @CAPS4 limits this old lady is willing @CAPS15 go @CAPS15. She proceeds @CAPS15 repeat this process with ten more peanuts until the entire family has stopped in curiosity. Looking up, @LOCATION1 pauses with the jar suspended in her hand. ""@CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways of cracking open the nut."" @LOCATION1 exclaims pausing for a comical response. With no reaction we resume position contemplating our meal choices. Minutes later a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and @TIME1 nights hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly. Raising his glass, @CAPS5 motions us @CAPS15 follow. ""@CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 calls clinking each of our glasses in turn. ""@CAPS6! And @CAPS6 @CAPS15 cherry people!"" @LOCATION1 pitches in. ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" I shout automatically. Immediately my parents chuckle because my grandmother has never been funny. @CAPS16's a joke that nobody in the family laughs at @LOCATION1's comments but herself and that's how @CAPS16 remains. Years ago, my brother deemed her jokes the ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10"" because she poses as a comedian but truly isn't. From then on, each time @LOCATION1 would crack a ""joke"" someone was quick @CAPS15 respond with yelling ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" To this day, she has neither improved nor given up daily opportunities @CAPS15 attempt @CAPS15 win over her audience. In quiet defeat @LOCATION1 chuckles @CAPS15 herself and focuses down on"
260	21038	8	3	"A long time ago, my family @CAPS6 I went to @LOCATION1 to see my great aunt @CAPS6 uncle. They had a log cabin right on the lake, with an @CAPS1 tepee in the back yard. They had a dock with a very big @CAPS6 nice boat. I had went with my @CAPS2, my other aunt @CAPS6 my two half sisters. I forgot why we went, but I think it was just because it was the @DATE2 @CAPS6 my great aunt @CAPS6 uncle were getting older. I was very young, @CAPS7 I only remember bits @CAPS6 pieces of the trip. I remember watching cartoons with my sister on the couch, watching ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" in our bedroom, having my sisters make me watch my first scary movie(I hate scary movies), going to a go cart track @CAPS6 driving for the first time, taking one of the extra little boats @CAPS6 going on the lake with one of my older half sisters, also taking the big boat @CAPS6 riding around the lake with my great uncle, he would turn in circles @CAPS7 that we would jump on the wave to make the ride more fun!  We get around to the @DATE1, @CAPS6 they where selling illegal fireworks all around the state for the event of course, but I remember sitting in the car with my two half sisters,@CAPS6 my @CAPS2 had gotten out of the car to go @CAPS6 get fireworks from a stand on the side of the road. We were all @CAPS7 tired from something, @CAPS7 we all stayed in the car. Outside the little stand where they sold the fireworks was this blow up balloon guy; you know one of those blow up looking things where it has a face on it @CAPS6 it doesn't stop moving @CAPS6 dancing? Anyways my oldest half sister starts saying ""@CAPS5 look there he goes doing the macarana!' I had no idea @CAPS13 she was talking about until she pointed to the blow up guy who was just wiggling @CAPS6 springing to life every second.Then my other half sister joins in @CAPS6 starts saying ""@CAPS6 now he's doing the mash potato!"" @CAPS7 now I'm laughing because it's just @CAPS7 silly @CAPS6 funny, I actually thought he was dancing @CAPS6 doing all these dance moves! Now everyone in the car is laughing @CAPS6 giggling about something @CAPS7 silly @CAPS6 funny, I mean we were throwing out silly dance moves, some not even dances moves, just random objects! ""THE @CAPS8!"" ""THE @CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" ""THE @CAPS11!"" ""THE @CAPS12!"" we could not stop laughing! when my @CAPS2 got in the car she was like ""@CAPS13!? @CAPS13 happened?!"". I tried to explain to her @CAPS13 was @CAPS7 funny but she didn't get it. I guess you just had to be there to be a part of the ridiculous car stop at the side of the road where they sold fireworks to see why it was @CAPS7 funny!"
261	21039	8	3	I personally do believe that laughter is an incredibly important element in any relationship. After all, who doesn't enjoy a good bout of laughter every once in a while? I know I certainly do. My true story revolves around the relationship between my @NUM1 - year - old toddler daughter and me. I'll share why I think laughter is important, how it plays a role, its significance in my relationships, and the benefits I believe it can bring to anyone's relationships. Everyone should take a moment to smile and just laugh, forgetting about the things that make them frown, so they can turn that frown upside down.  My relationship with @PERSON1 (my @NUM1 - year - old) is filled with mixed emotions at all times and is constantly evolving. The emotions range from pure happiness and admiration to anger, frustration, and a great deal of stress. Of course, despite these different feelings, I love her with every fiber of my being. But during those moments when I'm so stressed out that I feel like screaming, she'll say the funniest thing or make the most adorable face. And it's impossible not to smile and laugh, which, I must say, makes all the difficulties fade away for that brief moment.  The most cold, angry, and hurtful people in the world rarely laugh. They isolate themselves and struggle to form good relationships with others. We all need a bit of laughter to avoid falling into depression and sadness. If you're always frowning and stressed out, there won't be any room to focus on the good things and just have a good laugh. When @PERSON1 does her little thing and it makes me laugh, then she laughs too, and we're all in better moods. She knows that mommy still loves her, and she knows just the right ways to make me smile. I just want to pick her up and give her a big squeeze.  Because at the end of the day, when you reflect on all the events of your day, whether good or bad, there really isn't anything you can do but laugh. And that makes your whole day worthwhile. It doesn't necessarily have to be your children who make you laugh; it can be any relationship with anyone. Maybe it's your relationship with your boyfriend, and you've been together for a long time. You guys laugh, right? Because, honestly, how could you stand being with someone all the time, claiming to love them, yet never sharing a laugh with them? If they never make you laugh, it just doesn't seem right. No relationship can truly be a good one without some laughter, especially if it's someone you love and are with constantly. The good things in life should outweigh the bad, so the more laughter, the better.  I know that parenting is extremely stressful, especially as a teen mom. And when she puts that smile on my face, I forget about my stresses for that moment, and it makes everything better. I'd like to give an example of when laughter really made a difference in my day, even my whole week. You know those days when nothing goes right, you're arguing with your parents or boyfriend or whoever, and you've just been feeling miserable all day and all week. You haven't laughed, smiled, or had any fun because the past couple of days have just been dragging on with the same old routines. Then, the weekend arrives, and I find a babysitter and go hang out with a friend or two. We all get together and start reminiscing about old memories, both good and bad, the ones that make you embarrassed or the ones that make you want to cry. But then we get to that story that always makes us burst out laughing if told the right way. And we're all laughing for what seems like hours (but really, it's only been @NUM3 minutes). Finally, we're forced to stop laughing because we're laughing so hard that we start crying, and our stomachs hurt as if we've done fifty crunches. It hurts so much, yet we feel so good. Then we just lie there, catching our breath. The only noise we hear is an occasional sputter of a laugh coming out of someone's mouth every thirty seconds or so.  So, all - in - all, that's how I view laughter and why I think it's important in everyone's lives. When you're sad, it will lift your spirits. And when you're stressed out, it helps you forget about the bad things and focus on the good for a moment. When you've had the worst week of your life, and then you finally get to have a weekend with the girls and laugh your heart out, you feel like a new person. Laughter is good for the soul, and it even exercises some kind of muscle in your stomach, I think. It doesn't matter who you are or what the issue is; laughter will make you feel better and help you forget the bad things.
262	21042	8	3	"@LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 has a deep - seated desire to travel. While traveling itself is a fun experience, it becomes even more exciting when you're with people you love. However, sometimes you find yourself in a new place with people you don't know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 gets the opportunity to embark on a trip together. During these trips, the students get to work with college professors, indulge in tons of junk food, take a break from their parents, and simply have a great time. It's an experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of.  At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the chance to go to @LOCATION2. I was overjoyed at the prospect, but being an extremely introverted person, I knew I didn't have many friends in the choir. Moreover, I'm unable to walk, and I was filled with fears. I worried that I'd be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors, or they'd cross a street corner without a @CAPS5 dip down into the street. Thousands of such thoughts raced through my mind. I was so terrified of being separated from @PERSON3, my one friend in the choir, that I almost decided not to go. Somehow, my mother managed to convince me that everything would be okay and that I had nothing to fear.  Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split into groups. Some wanted to explore the @PERSON7, while others wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true – I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to reassure myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but deep down, I kept thinking that I'd be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I ended up on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life.  When we reached the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street, we split again. One group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill, and the other was going to take one of the old trolleys up to the top and then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I had to take the trolley because the hill was so steep that part of the sidewalk had steps, and since I can't walk, the trolley was my only option. Several other kids joined us, and once again, @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple of hours later, after getting lost and making some wrong turns on the streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid talking to @PERSON4 during this time, so the ride up the hill was quite enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 during our ride.  There were six people in our group at that time – two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, said they really needed to go to the bathroom. So, one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 rushed back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me alone with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, the remaining chaperon. We strolled down the hill slowly, with @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every now and then, they'd ask me a question, and I'd answer in as few words as possible. That's what was happening when we walked past a group of men arguing in front of a store, and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We weren't sure who he was talking to or what he meant, so we just kept walking. But as we reached the end of the block, @PERSON4 and I burst out laughing simultaneously. We realized the man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill, we started coming up with all sorts of funny responses I could have given to the man, each one funnier than the last. As our conversation continued, we found that @PERSON4 and I had many things in common. We both loved musicals, enjoyed reading, and had annoying younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON4 and I have become fairly good friends, all thanks to that shared moment of laughter."
263	21043	8	3	"I believe laughter has the remarkable ability to bring many different people together. In my friendships, my friends and I are always laughing about the random, silly things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an essential part of any friendship or relationship.  One particular time when laughter made a huge difference was during fourth grade. Fourth grade brought a roller - coaster of ups and downs that none of us had anticipated. My friends and I had a huge fight over the smallest of reasons. This fight involved my best friend @PERSON2, my neighbor @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We were all very close until this fight, which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone took sides; @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2, and I was left all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't take sides; they just wanted us to get along. It was especially hard for @DATE2 and me because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class were shocked to see us having such a big fight.  @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 tried their best to hang out with both of us, but @LOCATION1 and I didn't feel that way. We thought they were never spending time with us. Soon enough, our teacher and student teacher called our parents to inform them about the fight. I remember that almost every other day, someone would go home in tears. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and the principal to figure out how they could help us. They decided that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would go to see a counselor. @PERSON3, however, was excused from seeing the counselor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 recalls, ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" I don't really remember talking, but I guess change was starting to happen.  When we went to the counselor, she was incredibly nice and spoke to us in a way that made us all feel at ease. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship, and all three of us answered with laughter. We said that we used to laugh every day, but now we went home crying. She asked if we liked to play games during our time together, and we said yes. She let us play games like monopoly, which was a lot of fun. At the end of the day, the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom, everyone was surprised to see us getting along.  After school, I went home, and my mom asked me how the counseling session had gone. I smiled and said we'd all had a great time! The next day, the three of us went back to the counselor and played more games. During this session, we also had to write a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, we read the papers to each other. All of them had the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future. To a large extent, this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends are either shocked that we had a fight or just laugh at how silly the fight was. When they ask what the moral of the story is, we simply say, ""Don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In many ways, laughing about this silly fight has brought us closer and kept our friendship strong. Now, we have even more things to laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs, and along with those come moments of laughter or tears. In the end, the only way to strengthen your bond with your friends is to laugh. Don't miss out on a single moment or second - guess a change in your friendship. Your friends will always be by your side on the journey of life, and laughter is the key to a lasting and happy friendship."

265	21045	8	3	Benefits of laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh you are having fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments, or disagreements laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits like working out your core, and lungs. One of my best friend's mom recently passed away right before @CAPS1. Her name was @CAPS2. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for @NUM1 years, and for a small amount of time i even lived at her house. She was basically a mother figure to me, because i don't live with my birth mother. I use to see her almost everyday, because of my friend @PERSON1. He is @NUM2 and we hang out just about every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom. I ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights. My other friend @PERSON2 spent the @TIME1 at @PERSON1 house the @TIME1 his mom died. When i made it to @PERSON1's house he instantly started to cry on my shoulder. It was wise not to try and make @PERSON1 happy with laughter, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. As time went on @PERSON2 and I started to think of ways to cheer up @LOCATION1. We wanted to get his mind off of his mother. Wouldn't you know it the best way to do so was laughter. I'm the jokester in my group of friends. So some how i have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer not a thinker. Id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it. Its a very undesirable feeling. Laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down. Laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter along with trust, and respect are @CAPS3 bring my friends and I together.
266	21049	8	3	"@CAPS2 @CAPS1      The first time I ever heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was at the beginning of my freshman year. I was intrigued by the idea of doing it but I wasn't entirely certain. During eighth grade, I had played volleyball just for the sheer fun of it and truly enjoyed every moment. I had firmly decided that I wanted to play volleyball once I entered high school. However, when I got to high school, my view of playing on the high - school volleyball team changed. I realized it was far more than I had expected, from the people to their attitudes. I understood that if I were to play on the high - school volleyball team, I wouldn't have any real fun. So, I started to look into joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. Eventually, I finally decided to sign up and become part of the team. I really hoped I would like @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and I had absolutely no idea what to anticipate.  The first day of practice, after school, I walked into the girls' locker room. I quickly changed my clothes and gathered all my necessary things. Then I headed out to the track shed. When I got there, I saw a large number of people I had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 began to talk to everyone who was new to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us that it would be an amazing experience and that it was a great sport. Moreover, it was more of an individual sport rather than a team sport, although we did many things together as a team. After she had talked and explained the basic aspects of @CAPS2 @CAPS1, we were supposed to jog our warm - up lap and then stretch as a group. Then we were to start our run for the day, and every day had a different workout, either a road run or a track workout.  I began to really take a liking to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, I was extremely sore and could barely move. But as the season really got underway, I gradually got into shape and started looking forward to practice after school every single day. We trained hard and prepared for my first race, which made me extremely nervous. I had no idea what to expect from my very first race and I was so scared. But after I had run my first race ever, I felt great and was proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something I have always loved ever since my freshman year when I first started to run.  One of my most favorite races we've ever participated in was called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"". The first time I ever ran in that race was during my freshman year. It was like our third or fourth race of the season. It also happened to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple of years. So I was excited for it because I had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that I would love it. The day of the race, I was once again nervous, just like every other race I've been to and still am ever since I first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination, we set up a tent and started to warm up for each of the races that were going to take place, a boys' race and a girls' race. We also went over the course, and that's when I realized what everyone was talking about - the mud pits and a huge steep hill, and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, I had such a wonderful time. My team and I laughed and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, from our bus rides as a team to all the enjoyable practices. As a team, we shared many laughs and all the great times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season. I loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We laughed and enjoyed each other's company during our practices and also on the bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun and laughed often as a team, and that to me was a significant part of getting to know my team and being able to build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a crucial part of running, having fun, and enjoying everyone's company. Without laughter, our team would not be as happy, excited, or even eager to practice. Laughter is essential in @CAPS2 @CAPS1, and without it, our team would not have had as much fun as we've had over the years."
267	21051	8	3	"One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1, in what I observe most, is laughing. There is that kind of laugh you let out when you don't really understand your boss's joke. Then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1, one of my favorites is laughing at your best friend when you're crying.  Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend. The lady was sobbing about how her boyfriend had just recently broken up with her. Quietly, I turned over my shoulder, trying to catch more of the story. Her friend nodded and comforted her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate, sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon as her friend said this, the girl's face blushed and she started to giggle with laughter. @CAPS1, still, her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1, a slow smile gradually washed over her face. The woman had more of a giggle than a full - blown laugh. @CAPS1, you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember that life is more than just a guy.  I thought for a second how this kind of situation happens more often than you might think, especially with my best friend. I feel like even after seven years have passed, it never gets old when we burst out laughing. Most of the time, it's something silly, and we're just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1, then there are other times where it will be like the situation of the ladies behind me. One of us is upset, and we know exactly the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine for any problem.  After watching the two women, I turned to face the front of me. Now I saw a teenage boy and girl. The girl looked slightly nervous as she kept smoothing out her skirt. The boy, on the other hand, kept shaking his knee up and down. You could tell he was trying to think of something to say while he kept taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl, she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head, and they fell silent again.  The train came to its next stop, jerking a little, which made the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse and gave them to the boy. His cheeks flushed red as he started to chuckle and explained how nervous he was and that this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boy's laugh was deep and echoed across the train, while the girl's was contagious and sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment, and they were both talking and laughing. This could potentially be the start of young love.  I smiled and rested my head on the window, watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is often described as being so melancholy, but I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds when you connect with another human, when they make you laugh and care enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.

The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slung my bag onto my shoulder and got off the train. As I stepped outside, I felt the cool air gently kiss my cheeks. I looked around and saw people hurrying by me, looking for their next bus or the person to pick them up. I sat down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walked by me. As they smiled and talked, everything suddenly went dark. I threw my hands up to my eyes and felt another big, cold hand. I quickly snapped around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad, smiling from ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high - pitched and muffled in my dad's coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. There was no particularly funny action or a friend saying something specific. It was just because I was so happy that I just had to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any particular reason, just because you're happy. And then in that second, everything bad or what you were stressed about just fades away. Maybe just for a little while, but it's still something that can make your whole day better."
268	21052	8	3	All of us know how to laugh, and all of us have probably laughed at least once in our entire lives. But I never laughed as hard as I did the day my friend @CAPS1 and I were waiting for our friends @LOCATION1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 to come back from getting @PERSON3 from @LOCATION3 to come down and hang out for a little while. @PERSON1 had to wait at my house for them to get back. On the way to my house, I was constantly thinking about what in the world I was supposed to do with @CAPS1 all alone. @PERSON1 and I always have a great deal of fun when we hang out, but we always have other people around. I was really anticipating @PERSON1's arrival because I couldn't think of what me and @PERSON1 could do without @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 being there.  We couldn't hang out in the house because my @CAPS3 had caught a cold. So, we had to go outside into the shop, which is also known as a garage, and hang out together until @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 got there. Finally, @NUM1 showed up, and I didn't feel as awkward as I thought I would when she arrived. She got out of the car and came in. We went straight to the shop and started trying to find something to do. @PERSON1 suggested that we sit down and just talk. I was up for anything as long as it was fun and didn't involve going anywhere at @NUM2: @NUM3 @CAPS4 clock at night.  I sat there and asked her about her life. I wanted to know if she was happy, if she hated living in @LOCATION2, and a lot of other things. But then the ultimate topic of conversation came up... T.V. commercials. We talked about all of our favorite @CAPS5 commercials and the reasons why they were our favorites. I told her that my favorite commercials of all time were the freecreditreport.com commercials, the old ones, not the new ones. The reason I loved them so much was that they had real - life situations in them, which made them very easy to believe. However, they were also a bit hard to believe because I don't know anyone who has had to work at a restaurant dressed as a pirate because of identity theft, or someone who has had to buy a really cruddy car because their credit score was bad. And I've also never heard of a used sub - compact.  Any - who, @CAPS1 said that her favorite commercial was a car commercial that had dancing hamsters
269	21053	8	3	"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down."
270	21054	8	3	"Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS6 really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE1, I was babysitting, @CAPS6 was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION1. She had the day off work, so @CAPS6 seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON2 to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS4 car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 ""@CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?"" @CAPS4 response was, ""@CAPS5, no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't close your door!"" @CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring the spare @CAPS1, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS6 so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS1 was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS6 from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS6 with @CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @PERSON1's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON2 said not to. They thought @CAPS6 was hilarious. @PERSON2 and I were not so humored by @CAPS6, although we did think @CAPS6 was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS1. @CAPS6 turned out that the @CAPS1 was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON2 blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS4 tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON1's adventure. @CAPS6 just makes me realize that @CAPS6's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS6's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS1."
271	21055	8	3	Laughter is a huge part of building friendships, relationships, and partnerships. Right from the moment you are born, you know how to laugh; it's the only innate ability we possess from the start. For me, laughter is the key that unlocks the door to friendship. If I can make someone burst into laughter, we're already on a closer footing than when we first exchanged greetings. As an example, when I started working at the daycare I'm at now, getting the other teachers to laugh was like a secret handshake that signaled their acceptance of me as part of the team. On my first day, I walked into the daycare feeling extremely nervous. They sent me to the preschool classroom, and I'm pretty sure my boss could sense my jitters, which made me let out a nervous laugh. That simple laugh made me feel welcome and gave me the feeling that we could become good friends. The children in that classroom were a constant source of amusement. Their innocent antics and silly behavior never failed to make me laugh. When working with kids, you quickly realize that if you can make them laugh or show that you appreciate their jokes, they are more likely to trust you. And with that trust, you can create a comfortable and safe environment for them. Gaining someone's trust can be a challenging task, but if you manage to earn it from the very beginning, it's relatively easy to maintain. However, it's also incredibly easy to lose. When someone is feeling down in the dumps, a simple laugh can work wonders. Laughter is like a powerful medicine that can heal emotional wounds and lift spirits when nothing else seems to work. It's safe to say that making people laugh comes naturally to me. I'm just good at it, and jokes seem to flow effortlessly from my lips. When you laugh, it has a magical effect on your mood and the atmosphere around you. It lightens the load and makes everything seem better. In fact, laughing is not only good for your mental health but also has physical benefits. It's a form of exercise that can boost your immune system and reduce stress. When I'm at work and the kids start laughing, it has an immediate positive impact on me, even on the worst days. Being around happy and laughing people is contagious; it makes me feel better about myself and the world. And there's nothing quite as adorable as the laughter of babies. Their innocent and carefree giggles are like little rays of sunshine that can brighten up even the darkest of days. Laughter truly is a precious gift that enriches our lives in countless ways.
272	21056	8	3	"Laughter, joy and togetherness on an idyllic summer day. One of my favorite summer traditions is the visit to the house of our dear friends, the Johnsons. They live on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside of a quaint, old town. Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a beautiful backdrop. We arrive mid - morning, full of anticipation. We either find our friends in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trail - building implements in their hands. After the customary hello and how - have - you - been, we often wander around the yard, exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses. During the hottest part of the day, we head for the shade of the lush national park woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun - streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully on the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. Mr. Johnson knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of interesting knowledge as we hike. He also, of course, has to tell us about the trees he's planted -- a redwood here (look how well it's doing! A foot since last fall!) and a douglas fir over there (not as well. That big redwood is shading it too much). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead - end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. We always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there -- over the stream or beside it, or up the hill and if so, where would the switchbacks be? could you really bike up a trail like that? After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. Then it's time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for the majority of the afternoon, racing from one end of the pond to the other, splashing on innertubes, having pondweed - throwing battles. Finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun. By evening, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs over the fields, and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the night. Mr. Johnson's favorite part of the day is at dusk, when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air. At one point, all the bugs gather together and create a tornado, twisting upwards into the darkening sky, and then -- they're gone, until the next summer day. It's an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappearing at one swoop. The best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; Mr. Johnson is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great friends, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we're lounging on the porch after our busy summer day. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the Johnson boys can find a joke to make, usually ""politically incorrect"" but always very funny. Now don't even get me started on the summer camping trips, winter ski trips or autumn cider pressing we do with the Johnsons. These shared experiences filled with laughter and joy are the memories that make life truly special."
273	21057	8	3	"What the heck is her problem,"" is what I thought as I glanced over and the new girl gave me a nasty look. Everyone in the class obviously thought the new girl was weird. She had a killer look in her eyes. I observed the way she glared at others in the room, and how her facial expression never changed. ""What's up,"" my cousin, Sarah, asked while staring at the new girl, who was, of course, the center of everyone's curiosity. I glanced over at the new girl and then back at the classroom. ""Come on! She can't hear us,"" Sarah whispered. Sarah's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as she thought. The new girl could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, she seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess it's possible; she has been the talk of the whole sixth - grade class since she arrived about three days ago. ""Hello! Taylor? Are you there?"" Sarah was now in my face and blocking my view of the new girl. ""She does look tough on the outside, but maybe she is actually a nice person,"" is what I said, but I knew it would not satisfy Sarah at all. ""Nice? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. She gives off that type of aura."" ""We shouldn't judge someone based on their looks,"" I responded. Sarah gave me a sort of confusing look. ""I mean, we never know unless we ask."" ""Well, if you're such the expert on this, why don't you go sit with her at lunch, and ask her."" Oh man. There was no way I could possibly do that. I know I did say not to judge someone based on their appearance, but she looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her she will kick me in the shins. What a predicament this is. ""Aren't you the one who wants to get to know her? You ask."" This one won't pass by Sarah either. ""Really? No way. We already decided you were going to ask. You can't back out now,"" she argued. Sarah is a very stubborn girl, and though she likes to pick on me, she really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior she has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy. ""Fine,"" I muttered. I had to give in. No matter what I say, I am going to have to face the new girl. ""That's what I thought. This is a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am just helping you out."" She had a mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at the new girl one last time, and then at the clock. It was 10:30 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at 12:00. I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe she isn't mean, maybe she is actually nice, and people are just misunderstanding her, including me. That aside, I don't even know what to say; I can't just casually walk up, sit down in front of her, look her in the eye, smile and say ""Hi. How are you?"" The impossible is just impossible and people should just accept it, in fact it should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, it was now 11:30 and still ticking. ""Thirty minutes,"" Sarah said in some type of singing tone. I sighed. ""Nervous? I kept watching you during class. Looked like you were going to jump through that window and run away at any second."" She laughed. My seat was by the window, and that option had not slipped my mind. ""I have no clue what I am going to say,"" I finally said. ""Just say anything that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or what she likes. Talk about school even,"" she replied. ""It's time. Go."" Everyone piled out of the class room and into the cafeteria. After I got my lunch, I started walking toward the table the new girl was at; no one was around her, no surprise there. ""Hi, can I sit here,"" I asked. My voice was kinda shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at what she said. ""By all means, go ahead,"" she smiled. Wow, she is really cute when she smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation by introducing myself and asking how she was and how she liked the school. To my surprise we actually shared a common interest, and bonded. She was laughing. I was laughing. We were laughing together. After that day, and even still today we are the best of friends. That slight feeling of laughter is so nostalgic, it's almost indescribable. How something so minor such as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anybody together to form a simple bond, a friendship. Laughter truly has the power to break down barriers and create connections."
274	21058	8	3	"It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing alone and having a great time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To me, laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know what to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy Saturday day in November. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""Oh my gosh, Taylor!"" We heard Lisa scream as Jenny and I walked into my room. ""Oh boy."" I thought, ""Here we go again. I knew it would be a mistake to have both of them here at the same time."" Jenny and I exchanged glances, I knew she had the same thought going through her head. ""What, what happened this time?"" Jenny sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, they did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends fight at each other the way they were. ""Stop!"" I finally yell. ""This is what we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to Taylor, ""go and sit over there."" Taylor walked out of my room and sat down. ""What, calm down. Can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, they nodded in response. ""Okay, let's just finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. Taylor walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""Aren't you just a comical genius?"" Lisa said staring at the screen. We started laughing at her because her eyes seemed to be stuck on only the actor. ""Oh my gosh, Lisa!"" Taylor said laughing. ""Who's calling who"
275	21059	8	3	"Laughter is one of the most important elements in one's life. If you're down, one smile, or laugh, causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better. Scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile. I believe that this is true, because in order to frown, you have to make your whole body look like it's frowning, like your shoulders and your face, but only a little smile shows people that you're happy. In that way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Everyday when we're having a conversation, someone will bring up a story, or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie, and cause everyone to laugh. For example, every now and again, my brother or sister will bring up a quote from @PERSON1 or @PERSON2, two comedians we really enjoy listening to, and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night. Or, a little while ago, my favorite movie wasGet @CAPS1 because it was quite entertaining, so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non-stop laughter. On the other hand, someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong, or just don't understand. Like when we were having a dinner party at my house. My family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because my little sister was learning about them in school. We verbally completed the train of ""Which @CAPS4 ruled @CAPS5, who they came from, and @CAPS5 they're other names were"". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So, out of the blue comes ""@CAPS5 about @CAPS6?!"". Her intentions were about the @CAPS4, but I believe everyone in the room heard ""@CAPS5 about @CAPS9 @CAPS10?!"", until we paused for a second and processed @CAPS5 she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself. Our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes, but there are also a few very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my next door neighbor that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night. After that, there was a period of not very much laughter and fun because we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew that his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought of that, there was a gap between the mourning of his loss, only to be filled in with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a really tight connection between each other, because we're so funny. There's never any stress between us, but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that, whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers that run into each other on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh, it's the spark to an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. This is one of the most important values that people have, and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity."
276	21060	8	3	"The human brain is an incredibly intricate piece of work. It's truly the kingdom that governs our lives. It has the power to infuriate us, guide us towards the right path, offer invaluable help, and unfortunately, sometimes even destroy us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it desires. It's really something else entirely. One of the most valuable capabilities our brains possess is a sense of humor, which manifests as laughter. It's the ability to not take life too seriously for a moment. That metaphorical light switch in our body that causes our brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brain's only way of coping with the world, scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people who finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor do I take things seriously. The same goes for my friends; we are always the ones having a great time because we make life interesting. Maybe it's the gnarly facial expressions we exchange with one another, or perhaps we just be funny - looking. Either way, we have a strong sense of humor. That's what life is about, finding true happiness with people who fill our life with joy. @PERSON1 said, ""live simply, so that others can simply live."" I believe we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year, a couple of friends and I went to Mission Ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made; our own hotel suite with two king - sized beds and a plasma TV. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @PERSON3 on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON2 was eating a bag of popcorn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. ""@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea."" @PERSON2 whispered over to me. ""@CAPS4?"" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word, @PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 toothpaste, a sack of coins, and a package of peach rings. ""I had nothing to do with this."" I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON2 began squirting out toothpaste onto @PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face, and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and pennies into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. ""@CAPS5 is going to kill you."" I gasped. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 wont! It will be hilarious."" @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON2 then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION1's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON2 intended on. ""@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes. @CAPS5 was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried toothpaste. Quarters, dimes, and pennies drilled into his skin, and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS5 stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON2 turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. ""@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?"" @PERSON2 questioned, confused. @PERSON3 grew closer to @PERSON2, she backed away slowly, not quite sure what his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON3 across the room by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle over his head. ""@CAPS9 fast."" @PERSON3 shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS5 could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. But sadly, @PERSON2 ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON2's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2 and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 still crusted over, @PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all stared at each other without a word. Everything was fine. It then occurred to me that no matter what we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. It's that one value in life we can cherish forever."
277	21061	8	3	"It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a bright and sunny day, which was quite odd for @ORGANIZATION1 because it was late @DATE1. Usually, it would be cloudy or rainy around that time. I got up with a great deal of excitement, my heart pounding with anticipation. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him, and I quickly said yes, thinking it would be an adventure. My dad is a roofer, so I couldn't go on top of the houses because I was too young. Safety was a major concern. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then I got my soccer ball out of my dad's truck and I started running around kicking the ball. As I was running, I noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but, in the heat of the moment, I forgot and I stepped on the slippery spot. I fell, but while I was falling, somehow I kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while I was turning red and extremely embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was in slow - motion. I was so embarrassed that I put the ball back in my dad's truck and I went back to work. The sun was starting to come down, and we were heading home. We arrived at my house, and I walked towards the house door. I opened it and I heard ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2. I looked around, and my friends and family were there. The reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS1 party. I go and say hi to my family and friends. Then I went to go take a shower. I was in the shower, putting soap on my body when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamed as loud as I could. I ran out of the bathroom. I went to the living room, and the lights turned back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head, I'm thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and I realized I was naked. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the moment, while I was turning pitch red and on the verge of crying. I ran to my room, put some clothes on. I went back to the living room and I enjoyed my party, forgetting about the embarrassing moments of the day."
278	21063	8	3	"What would you do in a world without laughter? Everyday, everyone smiles or laughs. It makes a person feel better, like a warm blanket on a cold day. Laughing is a healthy drug; it affects you and other people for the best. There are many times in my life where all I needed was to laugh. All I wanted was to have someone there to make me smile and bring up my spirits. I have an example. I just moved again; it was my @NUM1 high school. I felt totally alone; I knew nobody, and nobody was there to help me feel less alone. I wanted a friendly face to smile at me, or talk to me. The whole @NUM2 hours at this new school was dreadful. I sat there, feeling out of place and miserable. When waiting for my mom to come get me, I was hating my new life here. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 one talked to me on the first day, then @CAPS4 one will talk to me at all"" is what kept passing through my mind. I remembered everyday after school walking home with my group of friends. We would all tease each other, or just say something stupid. We were always laughing and happy, our voices ringing through the streets. As I was sitting there waiting for my mom, I heard my name being called by a familiar voice. As I looked up, I found my friends @PERSON5, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 sticking their heads out my mom's car window waving at me. Seeing how school just barely got out, there were tons of teenagers still loitering around. ""@PERSON2, @PERSON6!!"" I exclaimed. My unhappy thoughts disappeared, and I was smiling from ear to ear. I could feel people staring at me as my friends got out of the car to give me a hug. For some reason, I didn't care; all I cared about was being able to smile again, and be truly happy with my closest friends. I grabbed my purse and ran over to them to give them all hugs. They missed two classes to come pick me up from school. My mom told them how unhappy I was, and that what I needed was a friendly face. She couldn't have been more right. After hugs, smiles, and laughs were exchanged, my friend @PERSON5 said his classic line. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @PERSON3?"" @CAPS4 one could help but laugh; even my mom broke a smile. When getting in the car, I forgot all about my bad day and how horrible I felt. I forgot about how badly I wanted my friends there to make me feel me. When they actually came, I couldn't have been more happier. My life felt great, and school after that was great. I made great friends there because my three buddies reminded me who I was, and pushed me to be me. They made me laugh, and when I smiled at my new high school, people were more open and welcoming to me. It wasn't long after that I @PERSON4 was able to go to school with a smile and laugh everyday. Friends have a great influence in your life; they remind you to smile and how great a laugh is. Laughing is the truth between happiness, I would have to say. It was because of me smiling and laughing that I made new friends and had another great high school life. Laughing brought people to me because it made me seem like a friendly and fun person that I am. I see laughing being the cure to all unhappiness."
279	21064	8	3	"@PERSON1 of laughter. Once upon a time, there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and forty - eight, and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1; that's when the world as they knew it ended. It was a desolate yet strange time. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny videos and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day, she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1"" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters printed on it. @PERSON2 was singing in a goofy voice, ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you."" When she was finished, she posted it on the website. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic failure that video was, but @PERSON2 of course loved it, and so did @PERSON1. Once the video wasn't that cool or funny anymore, which took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But when someone would watch it for the first time, they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didn't think it was funny anymore. So from then on, people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed, and when @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didn't laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing when someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and"
280	21065	8	3	When we look back on the past, everything seems to have had a deeper meaning. When we grow older, however, we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams.  So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget.
281	21067	8	3	"It all started with a book @DATE1 @DATE1 ago. My mom, noticing that I was constantly struggling to find friends at school, decided to take it upon herself to help me make some. She had a few old friends from school, and those friends had kids of their own, some of whom were my age. I had been around these girls a few times during my childhood, but it had been a while. To this day, I'm not sure what my mom saw in @LOCATION1 that made her think we would click, but she was right. What seemed like such a small action would change my life drastically.  In @DATE2, in my new and somewhat cozy house, I first met @PERSON1. That evening before she arrived, I couldn't help but be very upset at my mom for doing this. I firmly felt I was fine and fully capable of making friends myself. She acted like she knew me better than I knew myself, but the few acquaintances I had, she didn't believe would be good for me. I didn't think she could be right this time and I didn't want to waste my precious time.  An abrupt knock on the door interrupted my train of thought. I could hear muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. Quickly, I retreated to my room and plopped onto my bed. The bulky front door opened and closed again, followed by footsteps coming up to my room. When @PERSON1 first walked into my room, my first thought was that there was no way we would get along. She was a gorgeous blond girl, obviously popular and very confident. I couldn't stop thinking how she was going to call me a freak and poke at my differences like the other mean girls at school did.  ""@CAPS1, what are you reading?"" @PERSON1 asked as she sat on my bed. ""Come look for yourself,"" I replied, offering her the book in my hands. I knew she would hate this book. It was about all the strange microorganisms that live and feed off your body. I was right, and as she leaned over cautiously, @PERSON1 read the book with a disgusted look on her face. Laughter was boiling up inside me, and I couldn't hold it much longer. My small, dull room buzzed with my hearty laughter. @PERSON1 looked over at me with another strange look on her face and then began to laugh along with me.  Once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken, we began to talk about other interests. Those @DATE1 short hours flew by, and we were finding plenty of things we had in common. We shared funny stories, introduced new music to one another, and talked about our hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in - tune with someone, especially someone I had just met!  Suddenly, our conversation was interrupted by a brisk knock on the door downstairs. We looked at each other and smiled. In that smile, I saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through. Very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school. Downstairs, we said our good - byes to one another. As the new, cool @DATE3 air began to rush through the opened door, I reached out to hug her. To my surprise, she took my gesture and ran back to hug me. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a smell very unfamiliar but surprisingly comforting.  Once she was gone for the night, I began to think. I really liked @PERSON1 and I wanted to see her again soon. I felt accomplished in some way and fulfilled to have this bright future opportunity brought to me so easily and perfectly. Guilt also struck me as I realized how I had felt about @PERSON1 at first. For someone who had been judged through most of school, I had been very hypocritical. That night, I stayed up later than usual, thinking about the next time I could see her, how she had looked, and trying to understand how we could get along so well.  Despite these questions haunting the edge of my every thought, I slept happily, thinking of the next time I would get to see her. All of those @DATE1 questions and concerns have been answered in the @DATE1, and we are the closest of friends. Not long after we started hanging out more often, we began to like one another a lot. One of my favorite parts about our relationship is how people get so confused to see us two so different yet so close to one another. We can take the stares, comments, and anything else we struggle with today and find a way to laugh together to reduce the importance of it. I have thanked my mom over these @DATE1 for many things, but mostly for what she has done for my relationship. If it hadn't of been for her, my life would probably have been much darker. No one on that cold night expected this one meeting to evolve into our beautiful relationship. Laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up. Thanks to the laughter that excelled our conversation @DATE1 @DATE1 ago, I have had the best experience I could have ever asked for."
282	21068	8	3	Since I was a little girl, I've lived without my bio - mom. @CAPS1 gave me up for adoption when @CAPS1 was only @NUM1. @CAPS1 wasn't ready to be a mom. @CAPS1 has always been a risk - taker and never thought about the consequences of her actions. My adoptive parents have always been truthful with me about her and why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out and I'm very grateful. If I wasn't adopted, I wouldn't have gotten to know my @PERSON1, the most loving, adventurous, funny, and wise woman you would ever meet.  As soon as I could walk, @PERSON1 would have me out camping and hiking with her. If it was a nice sunny day, no one would have any doubt where we would be. Whether we were at @PERSON1's house in the spring or summer, we would always be out in her garden. Boy, how @PERSON1 loves her gardens and flowers. No, wait, that's a lie. @PERSON1 loves nature, period.  @CAPS1 has taught me how to appreciate everything around me, especially nature. For me and her, we are closer than anything you could think of. If she's the sky, I'm her stars. If I'm a bird, @CAPS1's my wings. It's that simple.  It hasn't always been easy for her and me, but the way we know how to cope is to laugh at everything and everyone, not in a bully or make - fun - of kind of way, but in a good way. Laughing for me and my @PERSON1 comes like a second nature to us. It's what keeps us going and makes us know that everything will be okay.  A few months ago, my favorite cousin @CAPS7 had passed away. @PERSON1 and I had barely seen each other in a while or had talked, but then everything happened so fast for @PERSON2. That when we saw each other, it was at his funeral. My Sizemore family was all there. Even though @PERSON2 was gone, he had a presence that was still there.  That night after the funeral, everyone went to my auntie's house and just spent time together. Finally, @PERSON1 and I got the chance to talk. Yes, we were both teary - eyed, but we were laughing too. We were laughing at all the funny times we had with @PERSON2 and all the crazy things he did. One time, he had gone to go get my uncle from the airport and he was waiting there in his Elvis costume, holding a Sizemore sign. Boy was @PERSON2 a goof.  @PERSON1 was just telling me all these things, and it was then that I realized @PERSON1 had taught me something else to appreciate. @PERSON1 had taught me how to appreciate laughter at a time of sorrow, to rejoice in a time of death, to have hope when you felt like you had none left. I learned that even though people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine to everyone's pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure; they think of it as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more than people give it credit for. My @PERSON1 taught me all those things, plus the real meaning of laughter, and that will always be with me.
283	21069	8	3	"Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON1 and I talk almost every single day and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything, and even if it is the saddest thing in the world, we will be able to make it funny in a way. It's just one of those unique things we do.  As best friends, it's our job to make each other feel better. And if one calls the other crying, it's their job to make the other laugh. And if it is funny for both of us, we know it was a job well done.  In @DATE3, my uncle died. I called her crying my eyes out. She said, ""Everything is going to be okay and just think of all the good memories I had of him."" One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life. Even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter, and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our busy schedule to get to know new people and get closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole life. Though me and @PERSON1 didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike than we thought.  Some people say when two people are too much alike, the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When we are alike, we can talk to each other about everything. Yet when we hit those differences and the other disagrees, it starts a fight. But fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state? Does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means we don't see them as much as we would like to. Even though we live close to each other, we don't always have time to see one another. But when we do finally get to see each other, there isn't a dull moment.  About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to Skate World. @PERSON1 was on crutches, so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the whole evening full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, ""You won't ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun?"" By the end of the night, she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools. I don't regret one thing that happened that evening. It was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours before one of the parents got there, and after that, we all went home. That is an evening I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happened differently. But when we look back a couple of years down the road, we will see that it was just fine, and it will just make us laugh. Some things are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when we get to that point is to think of something happy or funny and try to laugh.  Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life, that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me, that makes this life, a life worth living. Though we can't help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more than we may know.  @PERSON1 and I have planned out many lives we would like to live, and looking back now on them all, I can do is laugh because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen, I doubt they will. But it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and believe they were going to happen for a while. And I know looking back in a few years, we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes us think of all the good times we have had in our life and lets us know that we had fun in our life. Though we fight, in the end, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON1 and I apart, with all the laughter that is shared between us. We are true friends."
284	21070	8	3	"Laughter. Something everyone does. It's natural, organic, and normal. They say children laugh more than adults. Maybe that's what keeps them children. They can still let that deep instinct to enjoy themselves be expressed in bursts of happy noise.  Laughter is always unique to every person. Some have musical laughs, others have deep belly laughs. Then there are those who snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes you laugh because you hear it. Those are my favorite.  Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I couldn't agree more. Laughing with people has been the greatest"
285	21071	8	3	"One day, a day before the party for my brother's @DATE1 to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin @PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be @PERSON5 , @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. @PERSON6 was already here of course because he's the @DATE1 boy. The boy's were suppose to be cleaning the apartment but their boy's and the only things on theirs minds are girls and video games. They played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad. Lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got @CAPS7. The last to boy's showed up now.   The last two boy's showed up and their names are @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 is showing up tomorrow after noon. @PERSON6 was so exited that he was turning @NUM1 years old , he said "" I'm @NUM1 years old now no one can tell me what to do"" and I laughed and said ""@PERSON6 go make me a sandwich"" and he said ""@CAPS3"" and I said ""so much for no one can tell me what to do"" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boy's went to the apartment to clean @CAPS7 but when I got in there they set up @PERSON5's x-box @NUM3 and was playing @CAPS7. I told them to get cleaning but they decided not to listen so I got mom and they sure listened to her. She took @CAPS7 and put @CAPS7 on the kitchen table. They were not happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-bow back. @TIME1 all of us were watching movies and playing broad games then mom told @PERSON4 and I to clean my room , maybe a hour after that she walked by and said "" bed time"" and boy's go to the apartment. The next mourning.  The next mourning @PERSON4 and I woke up to the sun hitting us in the eyes and I said ""what a great way to start off the day"" and @PERSON4 said ""I know"". The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When @PERSON4 and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @TIME1 that @TIME1 the boy's thought @CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. @PERSON2 , @CAPS2 , @PERSON6 were the cops and @PERSON5 and @CAPS1 were the rubbers. @PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into @PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @CAPS7 was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the @TIME1. Mom told @PERSON4 and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said ""yes"". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so @PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs @PERSON5 saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said ""good mourning beautiful"" and I said ""good mourning to you to baby"". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister @CAPS6 walked in to the kitchen and said ""ma'am I want a cookie"" and mom said "" okay , here you go baby"". @CAPS6 ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. @PERSON4 and I looked at mom and said ""wow"" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. @CAPS7 was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of @CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and @PERSON6 said "" @CAPS7 was his most favorite @DATE1 he's ever had so far . @CAPS6 wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and @PERSON4 , the boy's when they came in the house and I. Sometimes you got to work with what you got and @CAPS7 might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made. Just make sure your happy with the people around you. "
286	21072	8	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @PERSON1 is an essential source of joy for me to survive this crazy thing called life. So instead of writing about one experience where laughter is a key element, I am going to write a montage of true events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blond moments first, seems how that's my natural hair color. When I was little, I would take my shirt off, throw it on the ground, and be like ""mommy, I can't find my shirt"". @CAPS6 would tell me, ""@PERSON1 @CAPS21 just threw it on the ground"". I would look in all the wrong places, like under the bed and inside the closet, and result to crying on the floor. @CAPS6 would pick my shirt off the floor, hand it to me, and then I would do the same thing all over again. Yeah, @CAPS21 could say I was a little embarrassed when I got older and they had it on video camera, but that's what I love. @CAPS21 grow up and laugh about what was once embarrassing and @CAPS21 move on.   There was another time when we figured out my initials spell @CAPS7. So whenever I go swimming with my brother and our friends, they start singing the @CAPS8 theme song, and I start laughing because if I let them think I don't care, they will eventually @CAPS4. Guess what, they still haven't stopped, and I am beginning to think I @MONTH1 be stuck with the nickname @CAPS8 for the rest of my life.   The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 kept rolling when I was in first grade. My brother, who @CAPS5 the way was in second grade, decided to tell my first grade teacher I had @CAPS10. @CAPS6 called my parents, who began to laugh like crazy and told her yeah, @CAPS6 does, it's a little thing called @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14. Looking back, it's funny because I remember the look on @PERSON2's face; @CAPS21 could say it was classic.   As I advanced in my @CAPS16 years, moving into @CAPS15 @CAPS16, I joined an organization, the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 of the @CAPS19 for @CAPS20. There, I learned later on that the color black is prohibited at any and all @CAPS19 functions. Well, the night I was initiated, I wore all black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I felt no embarrassment, just the need to laugh.   I found later that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech. So when I had to get up and give a speech in front of approximately one - hundred and twenty people, I made little efforts at making jokes and comments. Did I mention I wasn't very @CAPS1 at jokes? But the ceremony went on, and people went along and laughed with me, even though I hit my head against a dream catcher.   @CAPS19 has taught me it's okay to cry at the depressing things in life, it's okay to fear the things that frighten @CAPS21, it's okay to love anyone @CAPS21 want, it's okay to live your life, but most importantly, it's okay to laugh at your mistakes. I think that is one thing I will always remember and pass on to my children when I settle down with a family, which won't be for awhile. I learned that lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick. It's a lot of responsibility, it's a @CAPS1 thing. My brother helped because I would of been nearly lost without him.   I know that because of the people who surround me with their positive attitudes and hearts of gold, they have formed me to become a better person, to laugh when there seems no way out, to not only learn from your mistakes, but to laugh at them as well, to show that @CAPS21 have a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember that when life hands @CAPS21 lemons, take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade and then throw it on yourself so @CAPS21 and your friends can get a @CAPS1 laugh every once in a while. Thank @CAPS21."
287	21073	8	3	"Twins For a @CAPS1 Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially cherish the laughs that make your stomach feel like it's going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS23 I surround myself with people that are like me, and that's why my best friend @PERSON1 and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together, @CAPS24's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter.   The best part of our friendship is that we are alike, I think, and we use @CAPS24 to our advantage. One @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and I were taking a leisurely stroll downtown. We were just window - shopping, when we passed a clothing store that had on display an auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.   When I turned to @PERSON1 and said "" @PERSON2? (her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our identical curves like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we decided that showing a little neck wouldn't be too bad. @CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS24 good.   As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous ""@CAPS5, kinda"". @CAPS24 was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone. We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS3. When we were close to the lawn of the library, @PERSON1 turned to me and said ""hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!"" @CAPS7 I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello. He asked where I was, and she said ""I do not know actually"" while she dug in her bag, ""but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put."" ""@CAPS8"" he replied.   All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said ""@CAPS9 I am!"" He was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road. He jumped a little, and I said ""@CAPS10 did I scare you?"" in a little school - girl voice, and he replied ""@CAPS5, of course not! A man does not get scared."" I just rolled my eyes at him and said ""I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes"". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I asked. @NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did.   When they were face to face, @PERSON1 shouted ""@CAPS9 @CAPS13 @CAPS14!"" and @CAPS3 nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON1 and I were laughing @CAPS7 hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON1 and I, and said ""@CAPS16 this is interesting"". We continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS3 even giggled a little. He told us ""@CAPS18't you two ever do this again!"" and I said ""@CAPS19! We basically are sisters @CAPS7 @CAPS23 not play the part?"" He just glared at me in discontent, and @PERSON1 rolled her eyes and said ""@CAPS2? Did the man get scared?"". We both cracked up again, and @CAPS3 just smiled cause he knew we were playing around.   @CAPS24 was just a blast after that. @PERSON1 and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS3 to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS24 was time to @CAPS14, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON1's mother was going to pick us up. She did a triple - take when she saw us. She just laughed at us when we got in and asked ""@CAPS23 are you two wearing the same @NUM2. I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied ""@CAPS24's a long story"". @CAPS24 was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS1 being my best friend."
288	21074	8	3	"Somewhere along the road, a guy once said ""a laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" @CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until I found out first - hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was.   It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me. Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do you recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if you can, then you might understand how I felt... and sometimes do feel. If not, you @MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single.   Before that certain event, when @CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing, weeping, just obnoxious - sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic.   Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred, @CAPS2 and I were together for years, two and a half to be specific. Yeah, a long time, I know. The day it ended, it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? The middle of freaking class!) @CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything too unusual to me. I was thinking ""yeah! I get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!"" I was such an idiot.   I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t - shirt. @CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off, dirty blond hair, rose - petal lips, and believe me on this one, unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON1 t - shirt, black jeans, and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan, glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes.   When I sat down, I'm not exactly sure @CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like an oncoming thunderstorm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. ""We have to break up"". My heart seized in my chest, and her other words blurred into one, becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't... my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm.   I quietly and quickly walked out of the room, making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways, along with the tiles, and eventually the grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with nowhere in mind. Until when I was finally too tired to stop. My cheeks were tear - streaked to my jawline, and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended.   As I look back at @CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was, however, not enough. No amount"
289	21075	8	3	"Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about."
290	21076	8	3	"Have you ever got a detention from laughing an inordinate amount in class? If you haven't, you're very lucky. I know that teachers absolutely hate students that don't pay attention in class, or students that will randomly start laughing when they're giving a lecture. I'm that student that will randomly bust up laughing (preferably at my own jokes) in class. In other words, I'm a teachers worst nightmare.  Ring....ring....ring, time for @CAPS1. It was a beautiful afternoon and I was feeling great! When I walked into the class, I automatically noticed that our teacher wasn't his blessedly self. But I ignored it and went on with what I normally do, which is get out my @CAPS2 and crank up the tunes. I like to listen to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more. The downside to listening to music is that you can't exactly hear everything that great. When I listen to music I have those moments when I feel like I'm in a movie that everything seems like it's in slow motion but you can't hear anything. It's almost like I'm secluded in my own little world and no one can see me or hear me, until I start laughing that is. Finally class started and everyone was being abnormally loud, at this point I was starting to see the steam come out of our teachers ears. He looked like a cartoon character off of bugs bunny. The teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class. I didn't exactly pay much attention to him so I went back to listening to my music. After a while, our teacher was now starting to get frenzied with the class even more so he told everyone whoever talks again will get their name written up on the board and you will receive detention.  About five minutes later my friend @PERSON1 comes and walks by me and starts talking to me. When I listen to music, I have a tendency to talk loud because I feel like they can't even hear me. So I start yelling, and she starts to giggle because when I wasn't looking my teacher was just staring at me wondering why I was talking so loud. He turns around and writes my name on the board (that meant I was given a warning). I turn to look at the teacher, oh no here it comes, @NUM1 my laughter is out, I couldn't control myself. When I laugh uncontrollably, I laugh like there's no tomorrow. ""@CAPS3! You owe me thirty minutes of detention!"" said my teacher. One of the biggest problems that I have is I'm very easily amused, I laugh at mainly everything and anything. When my teacher yelled at me, his facial expression was just way too funny, so I began to laugh even harder.  When I start laughing, my friend @PERSON1 usually can't help herself but start laughing with me. She tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too. So she got what she wanted, detention! One week later, @PERSON1 and I arrived in good old detention with all the other ""rebels"" (that's what I call myself now) it makes me feel tough. The thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other. When we sit by each other, we can't stop laughing, but we decided to sit by each other anyways. What do you know, we almost got more detention while in detention, imagine that.  ""@CAPS4's to short to live with tension and regrets, so just laugh it off!"" That motto is what I try to live by everyday. I feel like laughing is a very important part in my @CAPS4, it really helps me forget what is bothering me. Even though I @MONTH1 get in trouble from laughing, I don't regret it one bit. Some people are very serious and they don't know how to let things go so they're always tense. Laughing releases tension and for me I feel like it brings me closer to my friends. I love laughing with my friends and the feeling of your abs hurting from laughing is awesome!Live your live, laugh as much as you can, and love those that mean the most to you."
291	21077	8	3	We all understand the numerous benefits of laughter. Laughter can vividly show emotions, and it can even go the extra mile of strengthening a friendship or a relationship. To many people, laughter is an extremely important part of any relationship. First, laughter is highly significant in a friendship. If you can't have a fun and happy friendship, then you won't have a truly good friendship. Building up a friendship can be quite challenging at times. It can range from having a hearty laugh together to not laughing at all, which can help determine the nature of your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the most wonderful feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can whole - heartedly trust, freely talk to, who will be there for you, and most importantly, laugh with is an amazing feeling. Also, laughter is crucial in every childhood memory. Thinking back to when I was little, I was constantly laughing. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers, I always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, and even aunts and uncles to keep me occupied and always have a great time. I believe laughter is an essential thing during childhood because it's healthy, you can learn to keep others' spirits high and keep them laughing and happy, and it's always beneficial to have a strong, fun, and happy relationship with your family. Last, laughter is very important in a romantic relationship. I think it will build character in your relationship and shows everyone that you're truly happy with the person you're with. Laughter will also build a good and strong, healthy relationship and will lead to positive outcomes. If you think about it, laughter is probably the most important aspect in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person you're with, it can prevent divorce and constant fighting, and you will have a strong relationship. So, therefore, after pointing out that laughter is important regardless of age, gender, in friendships, childhood, or relationships, you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. It helps build a strong - willed person and also builds character within yourself, making life more enjoyable.
292	21078	8	3	Have you ever found yourself in an awkward situation and managed to lighten the mood with a hearty laugh? I have, and many others have too. I've discovered that laughter makes people feel more at ease, which allows them to be their genuine selves. Laughter can even help some individuals attract a positive, friendly crowd that appreciates funny and happy people. Although laughter may not work in this way for everyone, here are some ways it has benefited me. I was at a homeschoolers' group in @LOCATION1 several years ago and didn't know anyone there. After wandering around for a while, this girl struck up a conversation with me. She was really funny, and being able to laugh with her made me feel more comfortable, and I ended up having a great time. I just had to find the right person. Another instance where laughter might have been helpful was when I was invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. There were several others there whom I hadn't seen in a long time. The whole visit was quite awkward, and all I wanted to do was blend in. I tried to act like everyone else, but if I had laughed and been more at ease, I would have been able to show my true self. When I first started at public school, I was nervous about meeting new people and wondering what kind of people they would be. After about a week, people began to see my personality, the funny, happy, and laugh - loving person inside, and that really clicked with a lot of them. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now, because our similar personalities meshed well. Laughter has brought me to a great place in life. Laughter can make a lot of people happy and comfortable in awkward situations. It can encourage people to show their true personalities and attract like - minded individuals. I firmly believe that the world would be a much happier place if everyone could embrace laughter.
293	21079	8	3	"Get up kids,"" my mother said as she was rushing to pack her things and get ready. I knew precisely what I had done wrong; I hadn't set my alarm on my phone for six am. Instead, I set it for six pm, and now we were running late. Thinking to myself, I quickly started packing my clothes for the week: six pairs of pants, six pairs of shirts, six pairs of underwear, and six pairs of socks. I placed my bag next to the front door and then realized it was right beside the other bag I had packed the day before. My sisters were even more of a hassle. As girls, they took forever putting on their makeup and straightening their hair. Finally, everyone was packed, but it was already seven am, and we were supposed to be at @LOCATION2 by then, yet we were still sitting at our house. Once my sisters were done and we were in the car, we could finally head off to @LOCATION3. Our family had been planning this trip for a month, and now it was @DATE2! I was really excited to go. By this point, I had butterflies in my stomach. We lived in @LOCATION1, and we were only halfway through @LOCATION2, with eight out of ten hours still left to reach my mom's cousin's house. I fell asleep for the first two hours of the journey, and now I couldn't sleep anymore. I was stuck in the back seat with nothing to do, so I started singing the never - ending song. ""This is the song that never ends, and it goes on and on my friends."" ""Stop it,"" my sister in the front seat yelled at me very harshly. I didn't stop, and she yelled at me again to stop singing. For a third time, I annoyed my sister, and she responded by punching my arm. For some reason, I started to laugh. It didn't hurt, and I thought it was funny that she hit me for just singing a silly song. I had a really odd laugh, so my little sister started laughing because I was laughing. Then my older sister quite angrily screamed at me and my younger sister to be quiet. My older sister punched me again, trying to get me to stop laughing. By now, I was laughing so hard that I could hardly breathe, and my face was turning a deep shade of purple. It was truly hilarious when my mom couldn't hold it back any longer and started cracking up and laughing with me and my younger sister. My mom wears dentures, and she was laughing so hard that they almost fell out of her mouth while she was driving, which made us laugh even harder. My stomach felt like it was going to burst from all the laughter. My older sister, now turning a dark shade of blue from yelling at us so much to shut up, threw her arms in the air and let out one last scream before throwing herself back into her seat with a very angry look on her face. Over the next minute, we all stopped laughing and were quiet for the next hour until we stopped to eat. We enjoyed our lunch and then got back on the road because we still had a long trip ahead. I soon felt tired and fell asleep in the most uncomfortable position you could imagine in a car. I had my head against the door, my arm over the front passenger seat, one of my legs on the seat, and the other in between the driver and passenger seats. I thought I was pretty lucky to have slept most of the way, as we only had about a half - hour left until we reached my mom's cousin's house. We were in the middle - west of @LOCATION3, and the mountains were incredibly beautiful. They were full of color and life, with gigantic trees swaying in the wind and squirrels scurrying from tree to tree, burying nuts in the ground. It was the farthest I had ever been from where I lived in @LOCATION1. I was glad to be on this trip with my family. My stay in @LOCATION3 was a bit of a blur. I can hardly remember most of what happened there. I played video games and ate unhealthy junk food with a neighbor kid around my age. My mom was the happiest of us all to get away from @LOCATION1 for the weekend. She hadn't seen her cousin in about three years and was really happy to see her. It was now @DATE1, and it was time to return to our normal lives. So, we packed up our stuff and headed back home. I was doing great at not talking and annoying my sister for the first minute or so. Then, I started to sing the never - ending song again. I have never laughed so hard in my life, and it made the long journey back a bit more bearable."
294	21081	8	3	The members of my immediate family are well - known for being incredibly clumsy and easily startled. Broken dishes are a regular sight in our house, along with spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood - curdling screams every time the toaster pops up. Although all of us are accustomed to these things, not everyone around us is, which can lead to some interesting encounters. Many people find amusement in jabbing me in the sides just to hear me scream and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor. Even though it can get irritating at times, it can also give me a reason to overcome my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any tensions I might have been feeling in a social setting. For example, a few years ago, I was staying with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 troop at @LOCATION1. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it's even more terrifying when the group consists of girls aged four to eighteen, with only a few adults around to prevent the girls from getting into serious fights. To make matters worse, where I was staying, a hybrid between a cabin and a tent, most of the girls were in middle school, and needless to say, we didn't always see eye to eye. Despite the fact that we weren't all the best of friends, there were moments when we could put aside our petty differences, like who was popular and who wasn't, and enjoy the time we had to chat and joke around with people in similar life situations. On one such occasion, I was trying to make my bed on one of the top bunks. I was in the process of stretching the sheet over the hard, petrified mattress that might have possibly been around since @NUM1 @CAPS3.C. Being my usual forgetful self, I decided to lean against the wall behind me for balance, completely forgetting that there was no actual wall, just a thin, cloth - like material that couldn't support my weight. The second I realized my mistake, I frantically reached out for something to hold on to and tried desperately to keep myself from falling backwards to the floor and certain injury. Just milliseconds before I would have crashed into the hard wood floor, I managed to grab hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on tightly, swinging back and forth like a pendulum. Finally, I let go and sort of gracefully propelled myself onto the bed below mine. It took a very long time for the laughter to die down. In that short period, cliques, biases, and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a random group of girls in a room but a united group with our own unique strengths and weaknesses, passions, and flaws. Though the adolescent years are extremely tough and there are numerous times when you feel like the loneliest person in the world, it's always reassuring to know that there are others who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments. One of the most essential skills to acquire is the ability to laugh at yourself from time to time and be vulnerable in front of others. We may not all be the same, but we all share the basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter, which can bring us closer together.
295	21083	8	3	"How Laughter Helps Laughter can be an enormous help when going through tough times. Like the time when my brother got run over by a skid - steer (tracked loader) at our farm. We had no idea how bad the situation was going to be. During our time of uncertainty, our family was there to stand by us, assist us, and prevent us from getting too down. It was just an ordinary day on the farm, and we were out operating the machines. The day was progressing smoothly until after dinner when my mom told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. ""But mom,"" me and my brother said in unison. She wouldn't listen and urged us to hurry up and leave. So, we went down to the shop and retrieved the skid - steer. My brother, @PERSON1, still hadn't come down, so I started the machine and began driving towards the garden. I noticed my brother running towards me from the corner of my eye. He was sprinting as fast as he could, and I shouted at him to stop and wait, but he kept coming. He attempted to jump on the front forks but missed and fell. I quickly got out of the cab and saw him lying on the ground, crying in pain. My uncle was standing nearby when it happened and immediately called the ambulance. We had no clue what was wrong with him. His leg looked a bit odd, so we examined it more closely and saw the bone protruding from his leg. Finally, when the ambulance arrived, the paramedics checked him over and asked me some questions about what had transpired. I told them everything I could recall and then went back to the house. It was nerve - wracking not knowing what would happen to his leg. We just hoped that it wouldn't be too serious. I spent the night at my grandparents' house. I had a really hard time falling asleep that night. The next morning was @DATE1, so I had to go to school. I still didn't know much, but I did learn that my brother's leg had suffered a compound fracture. Throughout the whole school day, my friends tried to cheer me up by telling jokes and funny stories, which helped keep my mind off the accident. It was tough not knowing how he was doing. Later that night, we"
296	21085	8	3	"While living in @LOCATION5 I met the two people, whom are now my best friends, @PERSON1 @CAPS14 @CAPS1 @PERSON6. I met them both in entirely different ways. @PERSON1 through school, @CAPS14 @CAPS1 through paintball.  I met @PERSON1 when she moved from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. Her dad was in the @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS14 had been transferred to the base that was close to where I lived. We had two classes and lunch together. At first, her and I didn't really talk much. It wasn't until one of my friends, @PERSON3, brought her to sit with us during lunch. Our friend @PERSON4 was overly hyper that day and ended up falling backwards in his chair, scaring some girls who'd been walking by at the time. We laughed so hard our faces went cherry red. After lunch we had class together, so we walked together and talked about lunch. I then asked her to sit with me during @CAPS3. We could not stop talking to save our lives. Luckily it was a free sketch day, for had it not have been we might have been in some trouble. After about a week had gone by, @PERSON1 and I found out we had so much in common, it seemed almost unreal. Never had I met a girl who could make me laugh so hard that I actually enjoyed hanging out with her every day. She'd make faces and tell me stories about her past that would make me just bust out laughing. We talk almost every other day through the internet, and even though she's over @NUM1 miles away, she can still make my stomach hurt from all the laughing. As for @CAPS1, he grew up in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, then later on moved to @LOCATION4. We met while my dad, brother, and I went paint balling at a place called ""The @CAPS5"". It was a slow day. Not as many people were at the fields as normal, yet somehow there weren't enough tables. We offered to share ours with two guys whom I found out were @CAPS7 friends, @CAPS8 and @CAPS9. As it got later in the day, @CAPS1 and a few other friends, @PERSON5 and @PERSON2, arrived. The games got a bit more interesting, but still not one person had been able to shoot me out before the referee called time. I was starting to get irritated with the lack of experienced players, when finally I felt two sharp paint impacts and heard a splat. I'd taken shots to the leg, mask, and trigger finger. When the game was over I spotted the guy who'd got me out. That person being @CAPS1. I ran over to him and said ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13"". He laughed and said ""that wasn't luck, I chose to get you out"". I asked ""well then why haven't you got me out before? huh? You know that was so totally a @CAPS12 @CAPS13"". He returned with ""I was just going easy on you, I didn't wanna make you feel bad"". By then I had a smile on my face and a giggle in my voice ""sure, that's why"". We continued to joke about the game, and the people who were playing that day. When it was time for me to go he wrote his e-mail on a small torn piece of cardboard, and asked me to keep in touch. As soon as I got home I sent an e-mail saying ""I still think it was a @CAPS12 @CAPS13"". Ever since that day we've been best friends. Still in almost every conversation one of us will mention the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and it makes us laugh every time. Though I don't get to see my best friends every day, we still make each other laugh long distance. It's just that now I get to spread the laughter to new people, and hopefully I'll get to make more wonderful friends like the two I've already discovered."
297	21086	8	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3 started out a few years back when I first met my cousin @ORGANIZATION1. For the first time I spent the night at his house. The day before, we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. @CAPS3 was all very fun and entertaining, but no matter what we did, @ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. ""This looks like that!"", or ""She sounds like this!"" With his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3, I could not stop laughing. @CAPS3 was unbearable; it made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and @ORGANIZATION1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter. @CAPS3 did not stop there. Later that evening, we stayed up almost the entire night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts. We laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousin's irrepressible mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever. The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. Even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and @CAPS3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the non - stop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject possible. The day continued with the ever - lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I thought to myself how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit. From then on @ORGANIZATION1 and I became best of friends and the times got better and more fun. Without laughter, life would be incomplete."
298	21087	8	3	"One day it was almost @CAPS1 and my sister, my mom, and I were all in the kitchen making desserts and a bunch of food for @CAPS1 eve dinner. My mom had to leave and go to the store to get more ingredients. Once my mom left my sister and I were still busy working away in the kitchen. I was working on one thing and she was working on another. Finally, she was done with making the cookies and decided to help me with the lemon blossoms (little lemon glazed cakes). The directions called for a fourth of a cup of lemon juice. So I told my sister to get the lemon juice out of the lemons. At this point in time, I am making the little cakes. My sister yells at me and asks ""do I just squeeze @CAPS3?"" and I, thinking she cut @CAPS3, say yes. Well, I was wrong. My sister yells at me again and says ""@CAPS3 isn't working."" So I turn around to find her squeezing an un - cut lemon trying to get the lemon juice out of it. I just looked at her, told her she needed to cut it, and started laughing. I don't think I have ever laughed that hard. As I am on the floor crying because I am laughing so hard, my mom comes into the kitchen with a bag full of groceries and the first words out of her mouth were ""@CAPS5 did @CAPS6 do."" And if you can believe it, I started laughing even harder. Also, my sister to this day is still called lemons. This is because my family and I thought it was so funny that all of our family and friends should know about this little experience my sister had with lemons. From this experience, I have learned that laughing is important in so many ways. It can bring friends and family closer together; it can make any relationship stronger. This experience in the end made my sister and I a lot closer in many ways and now we always laugh together and I would rather laugh than fight with her. My sister and I since this incident have become so much closer to the point now that we can tell each other anything and everything. I think everyone should laugh because you might not know that laughing over the stupidest thing could make any relationship better and make the two people closer. So live life to the fullest and laugh as much as you can because you never know when a good laugh could help you become friends with someone or bring you and someone closer than ever."
299	21089	8	3	After a long day at the @ORGANIZATION1, mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We got @CAPS6 legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp. After the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason it sent us into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard, we started to cry. We had just finished going clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION1 and mom said that I could pick where we went out to eat. My brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 which is what my brother said he would have picked anyway. I picked that restaurant for two reasons. First, because it was close to the @ORGANIZATION1, and second, because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money so she said we should all share a few things instead of everybody getting their own. We bought two pounds of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 legs, and an order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp (mainly for herself). I'm kind of glad we all shared because it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take home boxes. We never eat leftovers anyway. After our dinner my brother and I begged our mother to buy a dessert. After much thought and convincing she said alright and ordered two slices of the best cake I've ever tasted in my entire life! It was so rich my mom and I could barely finish our slice. My brother gulped his down with ease. After we were done the waiter came by and replaced our plates with the tab. We all glanced at it and decided not to get dessert again (which never actually happened). Then mom got a bad case of the giggles. Shortly after my brother and I caught the giggles like a disease. Giggles turned into laughter and the laughter became hysterical. We couldn't seem to figure out what was so funny or how it happened. People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Pretty soon our eyes started to water and then there were tears. Tears of joy I'd assume but I knew one thing for sure, we had to get out of there. Mom managed to pay the tab just fine, but as soon as she got in the car and heard me and my brother laughing, she started busting up again! She was absolutely convinced it was the cake. She said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh about nothing. Now I believe that statement because we've tried every other dessert and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh. I guess it's not just the seafood that I like. I rather enjoy the cake too. We call it the double chocolate laugh cake.
300	21090	8	3	The @CAPS1 of Laughter. My friends and I always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. My friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that shows otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. My other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue. One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, my girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full - cushion couch, that comforted every part of my body. Two hours flew by and the girls got it. They both had each leg step and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back - up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button. The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us looked at each other and started dying from laughter. @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1 got up, crying from laughing and apologized to each other. All of this happened while I was recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video. Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for my friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is.
301	21091	8	3	"Can you imagine life without laughter? Life without laughter is plain, dull, and utterly boring. Laughter is an incredibly important part in life. There would truly be nothing to look forward to if laughing didn't exist. Laughter creates precious memories, strong relationships, and it fills in the awkward silence that might occur between two people.   Some people don't realize how truly important laughing is. Life without laughter is like life without water, a vital element that sustains and enriches. I think that's how important laughter really is. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is true, but laughing is more than just an element. It's way more important than that. Well, I guess we could all technically live without laughter, but who in their right mind would want to?   No laughter means no fun times like: swimming on a sunny day, enjoying the thrills at water parks, gliding gracefully on ice while ice skating, or dancing with abandon. Those fun things can lead to hearty laughter. Without anything fun to do, no one would look forward to tomorrow. Everyday would be a waste, if there wasn't any laughter in the world.   Some people might just think that laughing is just an element. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example, water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It stands for the vast ocean. Laughter doesn't fit in that category. Laughing has such a huge impact on our lives. Laughing makes everything ten times better. Laughing creates memories, and memories create relationships. That's why laughter is an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing, like a simple laugh, can make such a big difference in our lives. In conclusion, laughter is a precious gift that enriches our lives in countless ways, and we should cherish and embrace it every day."
302	21092	8	3	"The Power of Laughter. Laughing is a huge part of most people's everyday life. It is a very common emotion that I see hundreds of times a day. Whether it be from something as simple as a funny face made during a casual conversation, a well - told joke, a hilarious picture, and even little things people do or say can bring laughter to even the most serious of individuals. My friends and I laugh constantly. We can make something funny out of pretty much anything, be it a mundane task or a passing comment.  I think being able to laugh, and joke around are very good traits to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and optimistic. I can't even count the number of times I have been in a complete laughing fit because of my friend Sarah. She is by far one of the funniest people I have ever met in my entire life.   Though she is extremely funny, she is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box. She asks questions after people already tell her the answer, she says exactly what I say after I say it without even noticing that I had already said it before her, and sometimes she even trips on the concrete while racing someone to her car after practice. The things she does may not be super intelligent sometimes, but they sure can give anyone a good laugh.  I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with Sarah on the way to volleyball practice, and she just belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to. What made it even more funny was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong she kept singing like she knew every word. At the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried. By the time we got to practice her and I had been laughing for about ten minutes straight.  During practice our coach had been explaining directions to one of the drills. She told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five diagonally. Sarah, not fully understanding the directions, decided she should ask and make sure it was all clear to her. So she put her hand up and asked, ""Coach, so do we diagonally serve to spots one and five?"" My whole team broke out into hysterical laughter. Sarah, who didn't understand, stood there looking confused, but when she finally understood why we were all laughing she joined in. That happened about three more times throughout our two and a half - hour practice. She even got put in front row which made us all laugh because she is very short and looked really funny next to the six - foot - one girls standing right next to her.  By the time practice was over I think we had gotten a better workout from laughing than from playing volleyball. On our way out to the car, Sarah decided she wanted to race a girl on our team to her car. The girl agreed and they took off in a dead sprint. You could see the determination to win in Sarah's face, and all of a sudden they were nowhere to be found. I ran up the stairs to see who had won, only to find Sarah face down on the ground with the girl sitting next to her laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help but to laugh. We sat there laughing for a good fifteen minutes, and we laughed about it all the way home. That was the icing on the cake to one of the funniest days I have ever had.   In conclusion, laughter like this with friends not only makes our days more enjoyable but also strengthens our bonds, and these memories will stay with us for a long time."
303	21093	8	3	"The Humor of Laughter. Many people think that my school is just like any other. These people are very wrong. My school is very different than most. For you see, it is filled with humorous people. These people make up a lot of the bright side of my school. Where these people are you might ask? Why, they are everywhere. The best place to look is in the hallways, especially on Fridays at my school, during lunch, or after school.  Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit - chat, let's get to it shall we?  I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a southern accent. She is also very enthusiastic, and I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, ""Let's we go!"". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this school, as well as many others.  There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is Tom. Tom is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them and laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly and really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny Tom.  There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes off, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named Jake and Mark, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a Hoberman sphere? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, and drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, Jake and Mark love playing with the Hoberman sphere, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the Hoberman sphere got very worn out and tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but Jake and Mark wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. Lately, though, I haven't seen them playing with it lately.  We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering through the hallways with Lisa, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! Lisa gets distracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around and rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wanders off the trail. Never the less, Lisa is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely off - guard and just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. Grace, on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats and pets do when she tells us about them. Together, Grace and I are very funny.  In the finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other and random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic, it was a very ugly man who was telling his friends that they were going to a night club, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During finals, there was also a guy pulling his friend through the hallways by the arm. The friend said that it was very comfy. Then, they told a teacher about it! Ha ha ha!  So you see, my school is much more than an ordinary school. You could probably call it a clown school if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never truly know just how many ha - ha's I say a day until you visit, so come on over. We will let you join the fun, and you'll see that humor can make school a much more enjoyable place."
304	21094	8	3	Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically, and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four: a mother, a father, and two daughters in a car. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired, after driving all night. The mother just woke up, yawning, and is wondering how much further until the destination. The sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee to perk them up, and loud music playing, the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull.  What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment. As a young child, I was always on the road. Moving from place to place, because of my father's work. At the time, we were living in a state known for its snow, Minnesota. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views, and beautiful landscapes, untouched by man. During the long winter months, the snow covered the ground, like a thick blanket on a bed. You could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold, isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist to someone unfamiliar with Minnesota's weather.  This was around a decade ago, so the environment might've changed, but nevertheless, it is still a breathtaking, beautiful state. After coming home from school on a cool autumn day, my mother told me to start packing my room. I knew we were due to leave that autumn, but I was still hesitant on leaving my friends. Every time that we moved, I had to say a heart - breaking goodbye to the friends I knew for the few years I lived there.  I went to my room and started to pack for a long, long trip. My father came to me and told me we are moving by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could pick up the uHaul. We went to check out the sizes, and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best of condition for moving over a long distance, but it's better than nothing. My father drove it back home, with my sister and I, and my father started to put the packed boxes in the truck. My mother, my sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuable, and mandatory items were stuffed in my mom's car, along with our cats in their cages.  After getting everything packed, and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul away to our new destination, Texas. Everyone had mixed emotions about leaving. My mother loved her neighbours, my father had some amazing coworkers, my sister and I made some spectacular friends, but we had to say our goodbyes to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it still hurts. The times we spent together, will always be in our memories!  Off we go! To our new temporary home. Driving from Minnesota to Texas. The only thing that I didn't like, was that we had to be in Texas in less than a week. A week to drive that long way? Less stops, more driving, and no fun, or sight - seeing... a total drag!!  It was really chatty and energetic in the beginning, but everyone soon got sick of being on the road. My sister's body didn't handle it well in the beginning, and neither did mine. Half way to Texas, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere started to fade, and so did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small area.  I wanted to try to make the rest of the drive fun, so
305	21095	8	3	"Laughter can not only be a benefit to ourselves but to others as well. We only seem to use it whenever you feel the need to become happy, but in reality it shouldn't be the only reason why. Laughter is not only being able to feel better but to let out what you need to let out. Being able to enjoy yourself is pride and you should feel better about yourself. Whenever you laugh, how do you feel? Do you feel like the world is lifted off of your shoulders and you feel better about yourself? I don't mean you have to laugh so loud and so much that you fall off your chair and roll around but a simple chuckle would do the trick. Watch your favorite movie or go have fun with friends, as long as you are laughing you will and should feel better about yourself. That brings us to what happens around @CAPS2 family.  When I was younger I would go on trips with @CAPS2 family up to @LOCATION2. At the time I lived in @LOCATION1. Every @DATE1 we would cram anywhere from five to nine people in a van and be on our way. Having hardly any space of your own you would think it wouldn't be any fun. All in all we would have some fights about where to stop on the way from food or when to turn but nothing too serious. Being younger then everybody I was wildly bored. So to fix the problem I would make @CAPS2 family tell jokes, make funny faces, do something. Right when somebody would let out a joke or made a face, I would crack up laughing. Pure bliss and pure innocent. It didn't mean that they were funny or that they were even trying but to let up the intense shoulders, I would laugh. When we would get to where we were staying on @CAPS2 great grandparents land, we would cram yet another time, in a small area for our sleeping. Everybody would get a cot and would have to endure the warm daylight and the harsh cold bitter @TIME1. The cold nights were the ones that got to all of us the most, because @CAPS2 great grandparents had land meant that the place we were to stay at wasn't filtering heat. Sleeping bag and the clothes on your back were the only thing that we were able to get. So when the sun slipped slowly from shinning its bright light among us, we'd bundle up. Knowing me I did not listen to what @CAPS2 family sad and I would drink tons of water before I rest @CAPS2 head against the cot.  If you have common sense, which when I was younger did not. You would know that if you drink a lot before you go to bed and having the cold surround your body, you would have to use the restroom at some point during the @TIME1. Because @CAPS2 aunt was only @NUM1 years older then me, should would be the one that would have to wake up to walk me outside, down the driveway, to the porter potty, wait for me, then go back to sleep while trying to shake off the shivers that controlled her like the puppet master. Knowing @TIME1, she was not happy with @TIME1 situations, I'm sure nobody would be. The last time she took me, she made sure it was the last time she would get up to take me to the restroom.  The @TIME1 came that she had to take me. We started walking down the driveway. The wind was not like other nights, ripping every which way and piercing through @CAPS2 skin. Another odd thing about @TIME1 was instead of the dull tired face @CAPS2 aunt usually would have, she was awake, more the awake, she seemed to have a slight grin on her face. Since it was pitch dark she had the flash light with her. She opened the door to let me in and shinned the light down in the cracks so I would be able to see more clearly. Once I was done, I felt the shaking of the porter potty and heard in the voice of a monster the ""@CAPS1 y was coming to get me, run, run run!"" @CAPS2 blood rushed all over, warmth is what I remember feeling. Pushing the door open, screaming, running for @CAPS2 ""safety"" is what went through @CAPS2 mind. As I realized @CAPS2 aunt wasn't with me, I looked back. Only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened. The meaning behind @TIME1 would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem. You can turn it into a laughing matter instead of a dreaded time. @CAPS2 aunt making me do something she would think was funny would be a better sense for her and relieve her from whatever she thought she felt. Its a cause and effect placement. Causing me to panic effected her to be at more of an ease."
306	21096	8	3	Have you ever felt an incredible sense of well - being after you laughed heartily? Well, numerous studies have shown that after a good laugh, you not only experience an uplifted mood but it's also an effective way to burn some calories. One instance when I was feeling utterly down, my cousin came over and managed to make me laugh out loud. This shared laughter was a truly vital part of our relationship. She not only made that day brighter but also infused it with a burst of energy. When people don't laugh, how can they possibly have as much fun? Studies have clearly indicated that laughing does wonders for your health. It enhances a specific blood flow in your brain, which in turn helps a person to be more energetic and cheerful. It has also been shown that regular laughter can lead to a longer life span. Moreover, every time a person laughs, it aids in burning a small number of calories. If it's beneficial for you, why not laugh more often? Just think, if nobody laughed, what kind of world would this be? It would be a dull place filled with unhappy individuals, just like that time when my cousin came to visit me. One day, I was feeling extremely low and depressed. Nothing was going according to plan, and it seemed like it was going to be a terrible day. Then, all of a sudden, my cousin showed up at @ORGANIZATION1 and surprised me. I was in @ORGANIZATION1 after school, looking at some random things when she quietly entered @ORGANIZATION1 and sneaked up behind me, giving me a good scare. We both started laughing so hard that our stomachs ached. She transformed a bad day into a really fun one. We had a movie night where we ate delicious candy and pickles all through the night. We even made up silly songs and sang them at the top of our voices. We had the most amazing time of our lives. The whole night was like one big party. I can't even imagine what would happen to everyone if none of us ever laughed. If we didn't laugh, our relationship definitely wouldn't be as strong as it is. It would seem as if we were sad or depressed all the time. If there was no laughter, I wouldn't look forward to seeing her as much as I do now. Laughing is a huge part of having fun in any relationship. It shows that you're comfortable with the person and that you're truly enjoying their company. If you've ever been in a slump and wanted to give up, you know how unfun it can be. But whether you watch a hilarious movie or have a chat with a friend that makes you laugh, you'll know the joy it brings to your life. So, laughing must be an important aspect of your life or in any relationship you have. Overall, laughing for me is one of the most crucial things a person can do to make another person feel welcome and at ease around them. It's also a great way to have fun and shed a few calories simultaneously. If you need a dose of happiness in your life, then watch a funny movie or hang out with people who can make you laugh. Laughter truly is the best medicine that can brighten up any situation.
307	21097	8	3	"Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 individuals often think of laughter as a means of expressing one's emotions, almost like a distinct emotion itself. However, I perceive laughter in a different light. Laughter is a powerful form of communication. Sure, you might @MONTH1 laugh when something is genuinely funny, but the truth is that you have some control over it. So, @CAPS5 do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; essentially, they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them. Over time, laughter can build strong relationships or even initiate them, because when someone laughs at you or with you, you are sharing a common experience. I know that laughter is an important part of my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I started sixth grade, I was extremely scared. I was terrified that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day, longing to have someone to share their greasy pizza with. Of course, I was overreacting, but the thought constantly lingered in my mind during the first few days. Soon, I even noticed that my friends were finding new people to hang out with, and I began to feel like I was becoming the outcast I had feared. Then I met him. He was a skater kid with dark hair that fell past his eyes and pale, almost white skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS3, when I saw him riding his skateboard near the front of the school. I didn't think much of him at first, except that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen. I was actually quite surprised when @CAPS3 walked up and started chatting with him as if they had been friends for ages. I followed @CAPS3 to avoid looking like an even bigger outcast. As soon as we stood in front of him, he said something that sounded like an insult. Usually, I would have just ignored it, but this time, for some reason, it really angered me. I retorted, and before I knew it, we were engaged in a heated verbal argument. In the end, I was certain of one thing: I despised that kid, and he clearly hated me too. Towards the middle of the year, our school organized a dance. It was the first dance I had ever attended, and I was extremely nervous, with butterflies fluttering in my stomach. I got a ride with one of my old friends, @DATE1. I liked @DATE1 because he was always friendly and non - judgmental. When we were in the car on our way to the middle school, he told me that he had to pick someone else up. It didn't bother me until we reached the house. The house wasn't very impressive; it looked rather shabby. When I saw the kid's left foot step out of the house, I immediately recognized his shoe. As he got into the car, I tried to pretend I hadn't seen him, but I failed miserably. The entire car ride was incredibly awkward. When we arrived at the dance, I walked on the right side of @DATE1 to avoid any confrontation. @DATE1 sensed the tension and stopped walking. What he said next really surprised me. ""@CAPS5 don't you guys just get along?"" We both stood there, staring at each other, when the skater kid made another one of his ""nice comments"". I thought it was going to be another round of our feud, but unexpectedly, I burst out laughing. He laughed too. It was as if, for the first time, we were on the same page and could be friends. The whole night, we danced and had a great time together. From that moment on, we became friends. During the rest of the year, our friendship grew stronger. We visited each other's houses and hung out at school. Eventually, I realized that he had become my best friend. Even now, in ninth grade, we are still inseparable. It's amazing how a simple laugh can transform a relationship. Laughter truly has the power to break down barriers and bring people together."
308	21098	8	3	"Entering the classroom, I felt a shiver of anxiety run through me. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school. My mind was filled with countless questions as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I could actually feel my bones trembling due to my nerves. To my surprise, no one approached me when I entered. Everyone was gathered around this @CAPS4 - go - lucky brunette. I just stood there, unnoticed, until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked over at the brunette. She smiled at me, and I stared blankly at her for a few seconds, not knowing what to do. When someone told me that she was also a new student in the class, I understood why everyone was so interested in her. I soon became extremely envious of her because of all the attention she received. I was a rather jealous child, and as I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend while I was somewhat ignored, my stomach twisted into knots more and more each day. I started to develop feelings of suspicion and dislike towards her. Even her name, @PERSON1, sounded strange to me. I had never heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Fortunately, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom from her. Even after a month had passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday was approaching after my first month at @LOCATION1. I was starting to figure out which classmates I wanted to be friends with and which ones to avoid. Unfortunately, I had to invite everyone in the class to my birthday party because it was a class - wide event. I didn't want anyone to feel left out, and since there were only thirty students in the class, I knew that word about the party would spread. I was aware that I hadn't yet established a good reputation for people to know me well. As I was putting invitations into everyone's beige, square cubbies, I hesitated when I came to ""#@NUM2"". This was her cubby number. The number of that girl with the strange name whom I had an unjustified grudge against. I silently cursed myself after I put the invitation into her cubby. When the day of the party finally arrived, I had everything set up exactly as I had imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake for myself. The guests started arriving, knocking on the glass door and leaving small, dirty knuckle prints on it. @PERSON1 came alone. When I opened the door, she shyly and quickly pushed a gift into my hands and softly murmured ""@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5"". I welcomed her like I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party went in all sorts of directions until my mom gathered everyone around so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused look on my face, my mom leaned down and whispered that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and that we would blow out the candles together. I was shocked. The person I had been avoiding and disliking was the one I had to share my birthday with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left as the party ended, and I pouted silently, annoyed at having to share my special day. After the party, I went into the house and found @PERSON1 sitting on the steps. Her mom couldn't pick her up for another hour. I walked over to her and started making small talk. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a big glob of frosting in his hand. He shouted @CAPS4 birthday and threw the frosting at my face. I was stunned and just stood there with my mouth open. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. Without thinking, I started laughing too. We couldn't stop laughing. At that moment, I realized that I had been wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and having a great time. By the time her mom came to pick her up, we were already begging my mom to let her have a sleepover. Although we didn't get to have the sleepover, I knew that @PERSON1 was someone I wanted to be friends with. Since then, @PERSON1 has become my best and closest friend, and that first shared laugh was the start of our wonderful friendship."
309	21099	8	3	"My best friend @PERSON2 and I have a unique tradition that we came up with. Every time she comes over to my house, we always slide down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We came up with this idea @TIME1 when she was spending the @TIME1 at my place. We were sitting on the staircase, bored, when it suddenly occurred to me. I turned to @PERSON2 and said, ""@CAPS1 could two little girls possibly do to have fun in the middle of the @TIME1, @CAPS4 all they have to work with is a long staircase that has been right in front of them the whole time?"" And she replied, ""I'm listening."" @CAPS2 we were both getting really excited because we finally found something fun to do. I said, ""I'll show you. We just need to gather all the pillows we can find."" The two of us scurried around the house, searching every room, and brought back as many pillows as we could. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS1 do we need all these pillows for?"" @PERSON2 asked, looking a bit surprised. When I said, ""for padding,"" she was even more curious. After the pillows were arranged at the foot of the stairs, I revealed my brilliant plan to her. She loved it immediately! We were so eager to start. ""@CAPS5 purple sleeping bag will be perfect for @TIME1"" said @PERSON2. I dashed down the hallway to my room, grabbed my sleeping bag, and ran back to the staircase as fast as I could. My purple sleeping bag is extremely slippery, which was exactly what we needed to glide smoothly down the stairs. Even though @DATE1, we are fourteen and fifteen @DATE1 old, we still enjoy doing @TIME1. Over the @DATE1, we have made improvements to our activity, making it more thrilling and a lot more fun. @PERSON2 and I have agreed on some safety precautions, which we thought were necessary. Although @CAPS4 we are just using the sleeping bag, we don't really need them at first, but as we added more elements to our game, we decided to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few extra pillows. The helmet scares my mom a bit because it shows that our activity can be a bit dangerous. One @TIME1, when my parents were out, @PERSON2 and I had eaten"
310	21101	8	3	THE @CAPS1  A couple of weekends ago me and my cusin were at my grandmas house. She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling @CAPS2 .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little @CAPS2 problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @CAPS2 running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.                          
311	21102	8	3	"We were all going out into the woods to go ride quads and trikes. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 had quads; I was the only one with the trike. We carefully loaded the trike and quads in the back of the truck and trailer, and then we were off to the woods. When we got there, we unloaded our rides. We got all of them warmed up but the one with a clutch. The only way to get that one started is to pull it with the automatic quad. Wilber says to @PERSON1 that he will get it started, so @PERSON1 should pull him. I got up there and hooked the rope onto each quad. @PERSON1 says he's ready, so @PERSON1 takes off fast, and somehow the hook just comes off and hits him perfectly on his back. He gets up, and it looks like he's dancing. He lifted up his shirt and asked us if there was any mark. Oh man, was there! The hook hit him perfectly; it looked just like a hook was printed on his back. @PERSON1 starts to tear up a little bit while holding his back. I didn't blame him; I would've too. You could hear it snap when it hit him. I look over at @PERSON1, and he's trying not to laugh. @PERSON1 looks over at @PERSON1 and gets off the quad and starts to chase him. I finally got their attention and said, ""We came out here to ride, not to kick some ass."" We finally get the bike going, but @PERSON1 was too scared to pull the quad, so I had to do it. As soon as we get the quad with the clutch to warm up, a cop car comes down by us and then turns his lights on. We knew what we were going to have to do, so as soon as I see @PERSON1 take off, I took off. @PERSON1 and I look back to see if @PERSON1 was behind us, and no, he was not. @PERSON1 told me we should just leave him, but I told him that would be way too messed up. We came back, and the cop told us he was surprised that we came back. We asked @PERSON1 what happened, and he didn't know. After dealing with the cops for the day, we tried to figure out what was wrong with the bike, and we found out someone was messing with the carburetor, and they were totally off. It sucks; we don't get our licenses till we're eighteen, but for @PERSON1, it's twenty - one. That really sucks for him. After that one day, @PERSON1 promised that he would never go with @PERSON1 and me again. This incident in the woods was a wild one, filled with both chaos and a bit of disappointment, but it's definitely a story we'll remember."
312	21103	8	3	My family and I went to our vacation house once in a while to see how things were going. We would spend a couple of days or maybe a week there. It was really nice. We got to hang out with our neighbors, ride quads around the area, feed the rabbits in their little hutch, the horses in the stable, and the cows in the pasture. Sometimes, I'd even put on a bit of make - up just for fun. Sometimes my dad and I would be sitting on the porch, enjoying the gentle breeze. We'd look at the beautiful scenery around us. The sunset painted the sky in warm oranges and pinks, and the trees with their changing colors added to the charm. A crowd of deer was wandering around, their hooves softly stepping on the ground as they picked at the scraps of food. The cows were walking along the fence line, patiently waiting for dinner to come their way. While we were sitting there, we would talk about random things like our dreams or play jokes on each other and just laugh and have a great time. One evening when we were sitting on the porch, my dad asked if I would like to take a walk. I said yes, and so we went into the pasture. Somehow, he had a camera with him. We walked and talked, and he took pictures of the flowers, the birds, and the landscape. I wasn't looking, but suddenly he was taking pictures of me. I looked at him and saw that the camera was facing me and his finger was holding the button and wasn't letting go of it. I ran in circles, laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face and I couldn't stop. He kept going in circles with me, still taking pictures of me, and we were just laughing and laughing. Those moments in the vacation house with my dad are some of the most precious memories I'll always cherish.
313	21105	8	3	Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter. I believe laughter can snatch me out of the awful crater which I hide away in. It creates a warm bubble of joy in the pit of @CAPS1 stomach, and when it finally bursts, it spreads joy throughout me. Laughter feels like a @DATE1 day when you can hear the bugs softly humming with the warm breeze, and you know you're able to float up into the cotton - candy clouds, then not realizing you're laughing at everything you do. Laughter flips @CAPS1 gloomy days upside down, and makes me realize every little reason I have to be happy. Sixth grade is a big milestone in everyone's @CAPS2. You get lockers to store your things, have more freedom to move around the school, and are able to be around older kids, and there's so much more. I always had a dream of laughing with @CAPS1 old best friend and giving boys our numbers, except it all changed when she moved away. No one talked to me or hung out with me at school. @CAPS1 old best friend never left @CAPS1 side no matter what, so it was really uncomfortable walking through the crammed hallways of a huge school with just the air breezing by me. School became unpleasant to go to every day for eight hours. Most sixth graders don't like school because of the homework and would rather socialize with other classmates, but not me. I felt alone when other sixth graders (mainly girls) made mean jokes about @CAPS1 appearance or how I always got good grades in school. They would steal the projects that I made and worked really hard on. They also took books, papers, and supplies like pencils and pens. I learned new formulas and facts, but never did I learn how to socialize with other peers. Three quarters went by of @CAPS1 sixth grade year, and I felt so alone like suddenly the rest of the world shriveled up and died, or moved far far away. At night, @CAPS1 eyes would spew gallons of salt - water tears down @CAPS1 face, splashing @CAPS1 pillows. @PERSON1 was @CAPS1 other best friend and never teased me or talked behind @CAPS1 back, but she stuck to the people who did. It overwhelmed me walking near the group of girls who would put other people down, but hid it with their certain acts around specific people. They would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how gross and weird they were. I didn't want them telling people rude comments about me, so I ignored them the best I could by doing activities on @CAPS1 own. A girl from the other elementary school noticed @CAPS1 loneliness at school and decided to talk to me. I was shy and felt @CAPS1 stomach starting to do flips, which was never a good sign. All I could do before I looked like a scared kitten was smile and nod. She told me that next lunch I should come hang out with her and her friends, but those girls were the girls who teased me. The next lunch I went with her, feeling sweaty - hand nervous the entire time. Once I started talking to them about myself, they just smiled and said I was adorable and a really awesome person, which made me smile from cheek to cheek. It felt good to smile for the first time in a long time. A couple of days later, the girls told other sixth graders I was a goody - two - shoes that is so dreadfully boring. @CAPS1 smile faded quickly once I heard those rumors that spread through @CAPS1 class like a disease. @PERSON1 left the group of girls one day at lunch to talk to me about what had happened. I told her how I felt about what those girls did to me and how it felt like the world always would agree with whatever they said. She confessed to me that she truly didn't know why she was hanging out with them in the first place. I was relieved to hear her say those words and for her to not agree with what that group was saying about me. The girls who talked bad about me behind @CAPS1 back were left to do whatever they desired, while @PERSON1 filled the breezy air by @CAPS1 side with laughter. Together we laughed at everything that amused us. Sometimes we would even laugh at each other during boring assemblies or at a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they cannot do. When she had a bump in the road in @CAPS2, I supported her and did what a true friend would and just laughed at how dumb the other person was being just to make her laugh at the situation. In other words, laughter pulled me out of @CAPS1 awful pit I hid away in and made me find @CAPS1 true friends in @CAPS2. Laughing has made me forget bad times and people, and has made me realize when they bring me down, I have a million reasons to laugh until I have to gasp for a sip of air. Laughter has been a huge part of any relationship for me because it allows me to have an enjoyable time, and I hope to always have laughter in my life.
314	21106	8	3	We often think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality, it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up when they're sad or to get out of trouble when we've done something wrong. People do stupid things like telling silly jokes or making funny faces just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that everyone needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make everyone laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in a bit of pain, like getting a scolding from an adult, just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child, my friend would always be picked on at school, for no good reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food, crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning, and I took @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, a thick smoothie, egg yolks, and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me, I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them, and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friend's face; she was in awe - shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it, and it got in a girl's hair. Her scream was so loud it was earsplitting. The smoothie - filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield), but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all huddled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out, it was too late. I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them, and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them, and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about. I could see every one of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me. They started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears, but this time they were tears of happiness. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then, and I still talk to my friend. She even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter, in a way, is the source of all joy in our lives, and it helps people become closer than ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately, I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did. Laughter and a bit of courage can really make a difference in someone's life.
315	21107	8	3	Laughter is an essential component to any relationship, as it can erase any previous uneasy feelings and has a strong tendency to bring two people together. This phenomenon stays true whether the individuals involved are in
316	21109	8	3	Laughter is an important part of my life. The best way to pass the time is laughing whole - heartedly with friends and family. Think back on all the fun times you've had. If you do, you'll find that in most of them, you were laughing out loud. That's because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone likes to have fun; therefore, everyone likes to laugh. Laughing is good for you in many ways. It keeps you genuinely happy, helps maintain truly healthy relationships with others, and it effectively relieves stress. Also, a lot of people laugh when they're nervous, and I'm one of these people. Especially when you're put in an awkward situation, like when you have to do a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school; it's one of the scariest things I've ever done. It was my sophomore year, and I slouched down in my chair and tried to get as low as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye - contact with her either. I put my back - pack in front of me in order to block her view. Every time she'd look around the room to pick another person to go, I'd hold my breath and hope it wasn't me. Every time it wasn't me, I would breathe out in relief. Finally, it was getting down to a few people, and I knew my doom would soon await me. I decided to take a chance and peek over my back - pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was her eyes meet mine. I tried to hide behind my back - pack again, but it was too late. She had already started to call my name out. What should I do? I thought to myself. Should I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans. Then I stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room. I could feel a nervous knot building up in my stomach. With note - card in hand, I began to speak. My words were quiet and shaky. My speech was about uniforms in school and if I agreed with them or not. As I went on, I could feel myself start to trip over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear other people in the room start to snicker. I smiled and looked down at my note - card and continued my speech. Afterward, I felt a big relief to get it over with. It wasn't perfect, but laughing at myself when I messed up helped me get through it without falling apart from my nervousness. Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations. But always be careful not to laugh in situations where it's not appropriate. It's not good for you to have constant stress. Finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get an A on your speech, but it did help me keep it together to make it through. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a great way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh, you're sure to have a fun and happy life. I know I do.
317	21110	8	3	"Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the natural ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the very beginning, so we don't really think about how incredibly important laughing can be. It gives us a deep sense of relief, a pure feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like different backgrounds or languages. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them closer. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can smoothly break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2 who I hadn't seen since I was two years old. My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel truly comfortable or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS1, I'm not fully fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me, and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS1 very well at all. While on the plane, I carefully contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepared answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere. Finally, it was time to arrive in @LOCATION2. We landed in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS3 waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time, we exchanged warm hugs and kind phrases like ""I'm happy to meet you."" @CAPS3 were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my real family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag. The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION1. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS4 was a lot harder than I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning, our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with but never really known. At last, it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION1 and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS3 were younger, in @CAPS3're mid - twenties, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner, there was laughter and smiles. At that time, I really began to feel like @CAPS3 were my family. I was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because without all the laughing, I don't think we would have bonded so quickly. Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations. But always be careful not to laugh in situations where it's not appropriate. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh, you're sure to have a fun and happy life."
318	21111	8	3	"Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr., there's always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you don't experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2. Of course, she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to each other that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for each other. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning. We were all a little tired, but for the most part, we were all hungry for sure. That is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2. Pepper. That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross - country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan, you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2. Pepper! Oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea. We were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper and drink it! Ok, maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to unpack our stuff so that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2. Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things. We didn't want him to do that because he would then realize that we had taken his pop. So we immediately ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to experiencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't until the night - time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2. Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! It was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls were tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Time passed and we were all still awake. We were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We stared them down as if they were some prized possession or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave. Therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut - eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second - biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place. And when the morning came, we were still in bed! Of course, @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock. We figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and the big old bald man was standing there and said ""I'm only going to say this once. I need my @CAPS2. Pepper."" It was so funny; we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because the old bald man was turning beet - red. Apparently, he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card. We were terrified for our lives, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious. Then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2. Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day: ""messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig; you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it."" Laughter and these kinds of pranks, though they might get us in trouble sometimes, are a part of the fun and memories we share."
319	21112	8	3	"Laughter plays a huge part in my life. My family loves to laugh. We are always making each other and people around us laugh heartily. @CAPS8 you put two or more @CAPS1's together, someone is going to start cracking up. Sometimes the kids in my family have games to make each other start @CAPS4. There is this one @CAPS2 that a couple of us play. No one ever officially gave it a name, so we just call it the Laughing @CAPS2. The @CAPS2 starts out with one person standing in front of everyone else who's playing. The goal of the @CAPS2 is to try to get one of the other people to start @CAPS4, and the first one to laugh has to trade places with them to do the same thing. We really don't play that often, just @CAPS8 there's nothing else to do. One night, my two nephews and I were just sitting around looking for something to do @CAPS8 my little nephew @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 play the @CAPS4 @CAPS2"". His older"
320	21113	8	3	"@CAPS1 do @CAPS2 know were my wax for my skin board is? I yelled to my @CAPS1 as i walked out of my room.I think it is on @CAPS8 book shelve but why do @CAPS2 need it?"" my father replied.It's for @PERSON1's birthday present, I don't @CAPS4 any money for him and i promised him something amazing this year so i am going to take him to @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and we are going to ride are canoe down the giant sand dune.why cant @CAPS2 just get money from us or something and then buy him a card at the dollar tree? my @CAPS1 responded to me with a look on his face as if he were saying @CAPS8 the stupidest kid i know.@CAPS2 know i don't take handouts @CAPS1 i would @CAPS4 to work for that money and i don't @CAPS4 enough time to work for it and hangout with @PERSON1 all day, I mean it is his birthday after all and besides this is more fun I said with a mischievous grin on my face.Well alright the canoe is already hooked up to the truck, my @CAPS1 replied.That's fine with me pops, but can @CAPS2 give us a ride out there and back? I asked him trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants.Only if @CAPS2 stop making that weird face at me, do @CAPS2 want to drive? He asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON1.Yes please, I said as he flipped me the keys.Pulling into @PERSON1's drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into @PERSON1's house. Walking into it i knocked on the wall and two heads turned to look up at me. One my best friend @PERSON3 a sandy short hair boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @PERSON1 who much like @PERSON3 had the same hair color but had pink rose cheeks. I thought i would fine @CAPS2 here i said . What's this adventure @CAPS8 taking me on today he asked? @CAPS2 will see soon enough i replied now throw on some shorts and get a crappy pair of shows I will be out in @CAPS8 living room watching the @ORGANIZATION1 win there game when @CAPS8 done. So leaving @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 to change I waited outside @PERSON1's room. Alright, said @PERSON3 we're ready now tell us. Not yet I replied with a mischievous grin on my face. @PERSON1 yelled goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we headed for the truck were my @CAPS1 was still waiting. So @PERSON1 said to my @CAPS1 as he got into the back seat do @CAPS2 know what @CAPS8 son is going to make us do today? Yes but @CAPS2 will probably want this one to be a surprise. Well why is there a canoe on top of the truck, are @CAPS2 going fishing @PERSON1? @PERSON3 asked as he climbed in next to @PERSON1. HA I wished laughed my pa as I started up his truck. Pulling out of @PERSON1's driveway I headed off towards the bridge and out of town, going straight towards @PERSON2. Turning into @PERSON2 I found a parking spot on the other side of an old car and shut off the truck, I tossed the keys to my @CAPS1 saying I don't think @CAPS2 will want me to @CAPS4 these in my pockets I said to my pa. There was only one other person there a drunk man waving a beer bottle around and sitting on a log. Putting the canoe into the water i tossed each person a paddle and said row to the other bank. As we reached the other bank we all jumped out and i pulled the canoe up onto the sand at the bottom of a massive sand duneWe are going to push this up the dune then wax the bottom and ride down the hill in it i said smiling madly at them bothYour stupid the commented together but were down they sad starting to push the canoe up the hill. As we reached the top we flipped the canoe over and started hurriedly waxed the bottom, then pushed it to a likely spot to slide down and all jumped in we slide forward a little but stoped. Without another word me and @PERSON3 jumped out and pushed with while running then jumping in we flew on down the sand dune and hit the water with a thud snapping the canoe in two as it flipped me out to a log ten yards away as i saw @PERSON3 fly out and hit the water with a cannon ball as @PERSON1 just fell out the side into the shallows. When i emerged i heard the drunk man yell from the other side of the bank.""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 THE @CAPS5 @CAPS6 IN THE @CAPS7 OF @CAPS8 @CAPS9' "
321	21114	8	3	"Have you ever found yourself laughing heartily at something someone said, and then, as the laughter continued, you began laughing even harder, not at the joke itself, but at a person whose laugh was so unique and almost more humorous than the joke? Then, after this hilarious laughing episode, did you notice that your mood, which could have been the worst in the world just moments before, suddenly lifted? Laughter truly is the cure for a multitude of things, from being in a bad mood to crying due to sadness. It has the power to brighten the mood in a room and can effortlessly make any awkward moment vanish.  One bright @DATE1 day, @PERSON1 called me and sweetly asked if I wanted to long - board down to @PERSON2's and enjoy some lunch with her. Of course, I jumped at the chance because I'm always eager for my typical @PERSON2's order of a rich chocolate malt milkshake, along with some crispy croutons and creamy ranch dressing. I quickly jogged to her house just down the block, and then we long - boarded all the way to @PERSON2's in downtown @CAPS1.  On the way, I shared with @PERSON1 how my day had been going terribly so far and how desperately I needed to be cheered up. She confided that she was feeling the same way. When we finally arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's, we were both excited to get seated so we could catch up on each other's lives and dig into our meals. As we walked inside, we noticed how unusually crowded it was that day as we patiently waited for a table.  After getting settled, we observed an older couple sitting in the booth behind us, some kids from our school in the booth in front of us, and a man and a woman across the aisle. @PERSON1 ordered a delicious strawberry milkshake and a juicy burger with crispy fries, while I stuck to my usual order. After the friendly lady took our order and left, @PERSON1 and I started opening up about the reasons for our bad moods. She was in a funk because her friend @PERSON3 was not treating her right. I was down because my friend @CAPS2 was mad at me for something that never actually happened. We were both quite upset, and frankly, we were in no mood for laughter.  But then, all of a sudden, we heard what sounded like a strange mixture of a goose's honking and a donkey's braying. We turned around in surprise to find that it was a lady's laughter. I looked at @LOCATION1, and she looked at me, and we just started busting up laughing uncontrollably. This laughter went on for about @NUM1 minutes straight. We were both in disbelief that such a sound could come out of any human being's mouth, and it was probably the loudest laugh I've ever heard. We also found it incredibly funny that all of this was happening in a public place full of people, and the lady was unknowingly setting herself up to be the center of our amusement.  @PERSON1 and I continued to laugh at the lady's unique laugh, and somehow, it started to melt away our bad moods. @PERSON1 started smiling a little more, and as for me, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing. Laughter has an amazing and unusual way of putting people in a good mood or relieving them of their bad moods. Whether it's a normal little chuckle or an unnatural sound like the one we heard that day, laughter brings people together and is a great way to turn an awkward moment into a memorable one. Someone once wisely said, ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and that person truly knew what they were talking about."
322	21115	8	3	There are numerous reasons why laughter is an indispensable part of any relationship. In my view, one simply cannot be serious about everything all the time. Laughing is a wonderful way to let loose and relieve the stress that builds up in our daily lives. It also has the magical ability to lighten the mood and make people feel more at ease around each other. And the benefits of laughter extend far beyond just these aspects.  Being overly serious about every single thing is not always a good approach. We all need to have fun in our lives to stay happy. Surrounding ourselves with people who have the knack of making us laugh is always a surefire way to put ourselves in a good mood. Laughing is an excellent way to take the pressure off and not feel embarrassed about our actions or words. Having a relationship where one can freely laugh at things when they are funny is an absolute necessity.  For me, I've noticed that when I'm around people who can't laugh things off, I always feel like I have to be extremely cautious about what I say. It creates an uncomfortable and tense atmosphere. On the contrary, laughing is one of the best ways to just relax and be ourselves. Laughter also serves to lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If I don't feel like I can joke around and laugh with the people I'm with, I usually don't feel like I can truly be myself.  However, if one isn't initially comfortable with the people they are with, it might be a bit more challenging to start joking around. But eventually, if one lets themselves go and starts laughing, they will feel a closer connection to those people. Being happy and laughing with others creates a really strong bond between individuals. Making things into a joke is a common way many people use to keep themselves from getting embarrassed.  Usually, if you do something that others find funny but you don't, and they start laughing, you might feel uncomfortable. But if you start laughing along with them, it takes the pressure off you, and they are no longer laughing at you but rather laughing with you. In conclusion, there are countless things that laughing can do for us. It allows us to not have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off, and it relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things people can do together to form a deep and meaningful connection. No matter what the situation, laughing can always put someone in a better frame of mind.
323	21116	8	3	What is one of the most crucial aspects of a relationship? In my mind, laughter would undoubtedly be one of the most important parts. Take my relationship with @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1, for example. We are constantly laughing; almost every moment we are together, someone is cracking a joke.  One memorable instance was when our varsity cheer squad went to @LOCATION2. We had a series of hilarious and chaotic events that night. First, when we arrived at the venue, our coach made a blunder and left the keys on the bus after we locked it up. One of the girls noticed this when she went out to retrieve her iPod. We all started brainstorming ways to solve this problem. Our first idea was to try to squeeze @PERSON1 through the window, but unfortunately, none of the windows would open. So, our coach had to call someone to bring us another set of keys.  After the exciting game, our cheer squad headed to @ORGANIZATION2. Before the game, our coach had promised us that we could go there to get some delicious cookie dough if we behaved well and didn't complain about having to sit on the stands and cheer. When we pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1 and I were so excited that we ran out of the bus, screaming at the top of our lungs. One of the staff members at @ORGANIZATION2 quickly informed us that running in the building was not allowed. So, being the creative ones, we started doing cartwheels and round - offs down the halls instead. But we were stopped again, as it turned out that those weren't allowed either.  As we were wandering around looking for the music box, we stumbled upon a baby stroller. Naturally, we couldn't resist the temptation and took turns pushing each other in it. But that too was against the rules at @ORGANIZATION2, and we were sent back to our coach. To make matters more interesting, we then came across a clothing rack with short little dresses. @PERSON1 and I decided to put them over our cheer uniforms. Just as @PERSON1 was about to take a picture, a girl who worked there sneaked up behind us. The ever - mischievous @PERSON1 ran off without warning us. Instead, she decided to take the picture. Once the lady saw what we were up to, we got kicked out.  The last crazy event of the night was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. For those of you who aren't familiar, it's when a bus stops at a stop light, and everyone (except the driver, of course) gets out and runs around the bus like wild people. We were just about to leave @LOCATION1 when the light turned red. I was standing by the door, eagerly waiting for this moment. I had to practically beg our coach to let us out. As soon as she opened the door, I bolted out as fast as I could. Unfortunately, the road was all muddy, and I ended up falling flat on my butt. Two other girls behind me quickly helped me up, and then we continued running around the bus. But the light turned green just as I rounded the corner. The cars passing by honked at us, and not in a friendly way. But honestly, we didn't care at all. We were having so much fun that we didn't even think about the other people.  In conclusion, laughter is an essential part of a relationship. Without it, our squad wouldn't have half the funny and unforgettable memories we do. That night, with all its crazy events like getting locked out of the bus, getting kicked out of @ORGANIZATION2, and the wild @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, will forever be etched in our minds.
324	21118	8	3	"From the moment of birth until young adulthood, kids are nurtured and guided by their guardians or parents. It is the solemn responsibility of parents to instill good morals, impart life skills, and teach their children how to cope and thrive in society. @CAPS24 parenting children involves being firm and strictly enforcing rules. The positive outcome of this approach is that the child grows up well - prepared to lead their adult lives outside the home.  Even though I'm still a teenager, I've learned a great deal about raising kids. My knowledge mainly comes from the stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. I find it incredibly enjoyable to be ""in on"" these small yet significant bits of family history. While many facts about the ""good old days"" are fascinating, it's the memories filled with laughter that my family shares that are the most precious to me.  My @CAPS1 grew up in the @DATE1's in a small but typical - sized house with her @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and four brothers and sisters. The stories my @CAPS1 loves to tell about her childhood mainly revolve around the memories made at the dinner table. It was her @CAPS5's (my @CAPS6's) noble goal for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. The @PERSON3 children were expected to practice this by remaining calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun - loving, and not - so - formal @CAPS7 family, this was quite a challenge.  Throughout their childhood, my @CAPS1 and her siblings tried their utmost to behave and follow the rules at the dinner table. The one thing that particularly annoyed my @CAPS6 was when someone spilled their milk. This seemed to happen almost every single night. The milk spills were either the result of a child being playful or reaching too far to grab the butter dish. Whatever the cause, it was always hysterically funny when it occurred. The catch was that laughing at the table was frowned upon as it disrupted the formal atmosphere the family aimed for during the evening meal. Both laughing and spilling milk were actions that were not encouraged at the dinner table.  As the children grew older, milk spills didn't happen as frequently, but they didn't completely disappear from the dinner - table scene. One memorable night, it wasn't my @CAPS1 or any of her siblings who spilled their milk. Instead, it was my @CAPS6. When the incident first happened, the whole family was in a state of shock. Everyone quickly donated their napkins to clean up the mess, while their @CAPS3 maintained a composed but slightly annoyed expression. After the mess was cleaned up, the family resumed their meal, and on my @CAPS6's face, there was a subtle yet noticeable grin.  Years later, my @CAPS1 (@PERSON4), @PERSON1, @CAPS15 @CAPS16, @PERSON2, and @PERSON2 @CAPS17 grew up, got married, and some even started their own families. Most of my @CAPS1's family lives in @LOCATION2, so they love coming up to visit their @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 (my @CAPS21 and @CAPS6) during the holidays or whenever they can. When the entire family gets together in @LOCATION1, there are hardly any somber or serious moments at the dinner table. As my @CAPS3 would say, ""@CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs."" I believe that the fun we have together is due to the strong bond of love that connects us all, and this bond would not be as strong without the element of laughter. My @CAPS6, who is now in heaven with @CAPS21, successfully achieved his goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can relax, enjoy each other's company, and freely burst into laughter, even if there's a small risk of someone spilling their milk again."
325	21119	8	3	Laughter is the gateway to happiness, and happiness is the key to a fulfilling life. When you laugh, it's like a warm, comforting embrace from within
326	21120	8	3	"When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. Although the memories are foggy, I can still recall the times where I whole - heartedly believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the summer when I was twelve, I remember those wild adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free - spirited and lacking a sense of reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I wasn't alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I found a trustworthy opponent. Her name was Lily and she was my best friend. Lily lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in vast acres. Through thick forests and gurgling streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called it our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a rickety bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical sunny afternoon in July, I drove up the long dirt road to Lily's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up my spine. Lily came down the stairs and greeted me with a warm hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress that fluttered in the breeze. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with my heart and soul. Next to her, I was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue sky. ""Wow, finally summer has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded, ""Another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. It's the first day of many!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both knew every word of it was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. Lily grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood. I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its prey. When I stopped for breath, I encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to find Lily. As I turned towards my destination again, a branch met my vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down my chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, Lily sprang to my side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom. Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent - looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was sharp and made me cry; it was my appearance that had me down. People would ask for days ""What's on your face"" and ""Oh no! How did that happen?"" Lily came to my side and squeaked, ""Hey, how are you?"" My face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to Lily and in one fluid breath I burst out, ""Terrible! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are Lily. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you seems extremely, perfect!"" My friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, Lily burst out into laughter. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and took hold of my arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. ""Wait,"" she called out to me, ""I'm not agreeing with you in any way. Hey, you just have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of my cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills and with each stitch, I laughed along with Lily to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me every day that laughter gets you through the worst while friendship builds an everlasting bond."
327	21122	8	3	"The wind rose and fell, whipping against the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house making it creak in odd places, like the old floor boards that groaned under the pressure. My aunt, uncle, and cousins sat at the kitchen table contemplating, worrying. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees. The ground was so soft and so saturated by the heavy rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted and there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of County Road 101 including my papa's were well - built, weathered farm houses. Most were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less than 50 acres of land. It's mostly wheat fields, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, and you'll find rows and rows of blueberries so big only 3 can fit on the palm of your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth by either accident or purposely. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in, giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful, laughter - filled summers there. Running barefoot through the fields, playing in the large expansion of lush, green grass. Feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On that fateful day, my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day she never would have let them get in that car. My papa, aunt, and cousin pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car, my aunt volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing its vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once this storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my cousin walked away with not even a scratch on his body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. God's hand had swept down and caused destruction. My aunt was killed instantly, my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my aunt; she was a social butterfly that fluttered from person to person, laughing, talking, sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, rain drops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just to share your grief. It's painful, to lose someone so dear to your heart. My papa cried, he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. He loved her so much, he needed her. Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents' initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, a sign of how my papa and aunt had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that, my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together just not physically, but you will never be truly apart. The day my papa returned home he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my aunt and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room it came. Small at first then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same. I've never seen the saying ""laughter is the best medicine"" put to justice better. My aunt was one person who saw laughter, love, faith, and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor."
328	21123	8	3	"When we were little it was watching cartoons. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister and I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen Sarah, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. There stood Sarah with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shrill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for the door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine - year - old, hair - pulling, all - out beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my mom had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. Mom's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in Sarah's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. Mom was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the past four minutes were just a joke now. ""Stop,"" she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way Mom could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but we couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, Mom's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half - dragged because we were shaking so hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety - degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't know any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e - mail that made you laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out."
329	21126	8	3	"When my friend Lisa and I went to go hang out with our friends from the local park. We knew how we would get there but we didn't know how we were going to get back, but knowing us we didn't care; we just wanted to have fun. We had lots of fun hanging out but then it started getting dark and we needed a ride back home. Later on I decided to call my dad to see if he would come and get us. Knowing my dad, he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck in the park, so he started laughing. After he was still laughing I asked, ""So can you come get us cause it's getting ready to be dark?"" and he said no, because it's not his fault that I was stuck there. So Lisa said, ""Why don't I call my dad to see if he would?"" and so she did but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no. Later on Lisa and I ran out of people to call. So we said to each other, ""Why don't we worry about this later? It's really not that dark and we can all still hang out for a while longer"
330	21127	8	3	It was a normal sunny day in the country hill's of @ORGANIZATION1. The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME1. Laughing is great. It mends the soul. Plus its a great ab work out!!!!
331	21129	8	3	"Laughter In A Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all deeply need, and it keeps us going in the world and with the daily duties we do. This is because we get frustrated a great deal of times. So, one thing that truly helps us is laughter. If someone is upset, the person might watch a comedy movie or read a comic about funny or humorous characters. But many people like talking to someone when they are upset and need an uplift from them.  When I was once upset regarding my school work and about not having a job, I went out for a walk after an argument with my mother. It was about my grades being dropped. My mom got quite angry, and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew I was much more capable than I showed in my grades. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy the things I wanted. They didn't think it appropriate to linger around about having a job so much and not care about my grades. When I was walking along the lakeside, I heard someone playing a guitar, and he played it so beautifully that I wanted to meet that person instantly. I tried to find him but couldn't, and at last, I just sat down and wondered who that person might be. So suddenly, a boy came to me with a guitar and asked me what time it was. I told him the time and asked him where he learned to play the guitar so beautifully. So he told me that he had been interested in playing the guitar for a long time and he wanted to join a band. We both shared our feelings, and we couldn't even understand that the things we never told anyone else, we were telling each other. After that meeting, we became close friends and we met every day. He knew I was quite tense, so he used to play the guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes, and I knew he was doing all this just for me. I sometimes just kept quiet and didn't respond to his jokes. He got more tense that I was not laughing or smiling. But I didn't realize that by doing this, I was really hurting him. But he never lost hope in me and he kept on telling me funny stories and we talked over the phone all night just so that he could make my tensions a bit less and make me laugh. So one day, he took me out for lunch at McDonald's because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going there. He took me to a comedy movie on superheroes, but neither of them were making me laugh. All the time I was just in his arms. But after the movies, he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach. The whole place was decorated by colorful lights, and we were sitting down on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy, and he told me jokes and we read comic books. Surprisingly, I started loving his jokes and the comics we read. Whenever I would meet him, he would do something special for me and make me laugh. He once got dressed up as a clown and tried to juggle balls but he couldn't do it so well, and I laughed at him so badly. I know it was being rude to laugh at him, but I loved spending time with him.  One day, he came to my home and we were talking, and he held my hands and proposed to me. I was really happy to hear that, and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He proposed to me and took me out for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectful manner, not with the intention that he was putting me down. But I had never seen a person like him. He told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. No matter what happens tomorrow, why should we care about it today when we have such a beautiful life waiting for us. We must live the way we want and not force ourselves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took me in his arms and said, ""No matter how much we love each other, but laughter is important in a relationship."" I looked at him and asked him why. So he replied, ""We must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other."" After we had some time there, he dropped me home and told me to live life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment, I realized that he was right, and I looked at life from a different perspective from that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laugh and enjoy."
332	21130	8	3	"I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me deeply. When I was about six, my family decided to take a road trip along a coastal coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together, there were eight kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was Tom. He was only a couple of years older than me. I adored Tom. We explored the beaches, swam in the clear waters, giggled at silly things, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. Tom and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, Tom and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this in the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into their bathing suits before. I thought why not? Tom liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit crabs into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one - piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten - pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road, my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking, and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road. Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood - curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes, dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream, I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by Tom's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"", we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  Tom and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put an animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good - bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter."
333	21131	8	3	"Laughter is a huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" Charlie Chaplin's quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently, our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.  Charlie Chaplin's story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend Jake.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port - o - potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t - shirt to go under a new button - up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t - shirt but kept on the button - up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If you ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, ""When it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all you can do. If you embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people, you need to laugh it off. If you can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" You need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.  There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."
334	21132	8	3	"Laughter is what connects me and my friends. It's a very important aspect in any kind of relationship. I know that almost all the memories I have are of my friends making me laugh. We have been friends for a very long time. One of my favorite funny memories is the time me, Sarah, and two of my friends went to the park. Sarah stopped at Dairy Queen. We sort of had a hard time getting out. Me, Sarah, and my friends went to the park to do a cultural performance at the community center. When we were done, we started heading back home. Sarah kept complaining about needing to use a restroom. Her dad told her to wait until we got to the next town so we could stop somewhere. Sarah and I suggested Dairy Queen. By the time we got to Dairy Queen, Sarah was doing the potty dance. Sarah and I got in line to order ice - cream cones dipped in chocolate. While we were waiting, Sarah was searching for the restroom. After approximately four minutes of searching, Sarah finally asked the lady working behind the counter where the bathroom was. She handed Sarah a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it and told her it was outside behind the building. Sarah took the key and sprinted to what appeared to be double doors. Little did Sarah know that only the left door opens. She ran straight into the right door and fell over. We all started cracking up laughing... Especially Sarah. She laughed so hard that she didn't quite make it to the restroom. Instead, she had an ""accident"" on the floor in Dairy Queen. When you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem funny to other people, such as, wetting yourself in public, it only makes your friendship stronger. Laughing is a huge important benefit in any kind of relationship. It strengthens the relationships you already have and it helps build new ones also."
335	21133	8	3	My special evening was a warm, sunny evening in July, 2005 in Miami, Florida. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person,
336	21134	8	3	I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a tiny baby, I hardly ever shed a tear; I was constantly laughing and giggling in a most adorable way. As I have grown up, I have earnestly tried to keep up my happy - go - lucky spirits. Sometimes, life threw challenges my way, and I couldn't always maintain that cheerfulness, but that is simply the reality of life. There have been numerous times in my life where laughter was the only thing that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always come through, and it has worked wonders for me. I often find myself reflecting that laughter and happiness are truly what life is all about.  When I was first born, I didn't let out a single cry. As a baby, I rarely ever cried. My mom loves to remind me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I was incredibly eager to be a part of everything around me! I was constantly on the lookout for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a single moment! My mom would have to take long drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fall asleep. For if I did, heaven forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I would immediately join in. Sometimes, I had no clue what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I adored the feeling of laughing with other people.  I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kids' baby pictures. In every single baby picture of me, I'm either laughing heartily or there is a wide, beaming smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a contented baby!  As a pre - teen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling brightly. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never experienced that type of emotion before. I was so engrossed in laughter that I never had time to dwell on the negative. Now, unfortunately, I know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I make this effort, I can always find a reason to laugh, and my spirits are quickly brought back up.  My friends are always a great source of comfort and a pick - me - up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me burst into laughter. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now!  Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loudly as our lungs would allow to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling, happy faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was drawn to those who I had the most fun with and who made me laugh the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking still holds true; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious! Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!
337	21135	8	3	"A moment that laughter made everything better was when I was with my cousin @CAPS1, in @LOCATION1. He is going off to the @CAPS2 pretty soon, so spending quality time together was the main goal for both of us. @CAPS1 and I have a very close bond; we talk as often as we can over the phone, sharing our daily stories and dreams. This trip meant a great deal to both @CAPS1 and me, as we have no idea how long it's going to be until we see each other again. Every moment of laughter and every bright smile was something that we will always cherish in our memories.  My parents and I went to @LOCATION1 for @CAPS4. In @LOCATION1, I met up with my cousins, since my parents seemed to be busy all the time with their own activities. Of course, when there is a group of teenagers together, well, it's bound to be loud and full of energy. I remember - on our @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 - my cousins and I got lost in the small town we were staying in. Now, let me emphasize that in that town, there is absolutely no way someone can get lost; it's so minuscule. So when we got lost, we found it incredibly funny and unbelievable. Fortunately, it was during the @DATE1, so it wasn't too scary. My cousins and I firmly believe it wasn't our fault; we blame the taxi driver for not listening to our directions properly. Because it was such a hilarious mess, we didn't stop laughing until we finally reached our destination. In the car, all three of us were arguing about where to go and what turn to take, while the taxi driver just sat there, listening and laughing at our chaos. It was so embarrassing that none of us wanted to see that taxi driver ever again.  @CAPS1 is older and significantly taller than me; he was the tallest person in the entire town. Now, @CAPS1 is always boasting about how he is not afraid of anything and that he is extremely brave. Until one night, all of that bravado was forgotten while @CAPS1 spent the @TIME1 in a state of panic. I shared a room with my two other cousins, and @CAPS1 stayed in the room next to ours with my brother. It was about @TIME1 when we all went to bed. Out of nowhere, we heard a strange noise outside our room. The next thing I heard was @CAPS1 yelling in the other room, desperately wanting to come sleep with us. I was also scared, so my cousins and I decided to let him in. I quickly turned on the light while @CAPS1 and my brother were rushing inside the room. My brother @PERSON3 came in carrying all the blankets and pillows, while @CAPS1 dragged in the airbed. It was such a comical sight that we all burst out laughing. @CAPS1 said, ""I may be big and tall but I get scared easily,"" which made us laugh even harder. The noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street.  I remember this moment so clearly in my head since it concluded our entire vacation with each other as a family. While my parents and grandparents were out on the front lawn chatting with all the guests, my cousins, @PERSON3, and I were in my room - like always, the funny moments happened in my room. We were just bored and had no idea what to do. Slowly, I was starting to doze off on top of a suitcase. All of a sudden, my cousin @PERSON1 came up with this crazy idea of how I could fit inside a suitcase. I thought she was joking at first, but when I looked up and saw everyone's serious faces, I knew they were dead - set on it. So, I started opening the suitcase and taking everything out, while @CAPS1 went to get his camera. The next thing I knew, I was squeezing myself inside the suitcase. I'm no acrobat, nor am I very flexible, so when I realized that I was having no trouble getting inside, I started to freak out. My brother was practically wetting his pants from laughing so hard, and my cousins were just stunned at what they were seeing. When it came to zipping up the suitcase, I told them it was going too far, but they managed to convince me to zip it up so they could roll me around. @CAPS1, @PERSON1, my brother, and my third cousin @PERSON2 all took turns rolling me around. They kept saying that we should go out on the front lawn and surprise my parents. I finally came out of the suitcase - feeling incredibly dizzy - after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor. We laughed and made jokes about how tiny I am and how much fun it had been after I felt a little better. Since then, @CAPS1 calls me ""@CAPS13"".  Saying goodbye to everyone was difficult, but saying goodbye to my cousin @CAPS1 was even more heart - wrenching. Knowing that I won't see him for a long time is almost unbearable. @CAPS1 and I have a strong bond, and I see him like a brother. During our entire trip, neither of us could bring ourselves to talk about him going away; instead, we chose to just have fun and ignore the pain. Laughing made that pain fade away. It made our trip truly worth going."
338	21136	8	3	My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a lovely boat, and since the weather was just right - not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside - @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest friends. I was quite nervous about meeting her school - going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there.  When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 warmly introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I politely greeted them all, and @PERSON2 then suggested we go @CAPS2. I was all set to walk down to the beach, but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed, and I was certain @PERSON2 would say no immediately. But instead, she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, defiantly tore it down, and casually tossed it in the harbor. Her friends burst into laughter, and I laughed too. I'd never witnessed people act in such a rebellious way before. But their disregard for rules and customs was so contagious that I found myself caught up in the moment.  As the day passed, I closely watched the way they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke in a very harsh manner. Everything they said was loud and shocking, and everything they did was meant to be wild and challenge authority. They appeared to be so free, but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly like this or if they were just putting on an act. But I understood that to be part of their group, I had to act like them. It was my very first experience with peer pressure, and I didn't know exactly what to do. But the girls' attitudes were straightforward, so I adapted and started to behave like them.  But it soon became clear to me that in order for there to be a group, there has to be someone who isn't in the group. That someone was @PERSON3. @PERSON2's parents had made her invite @PERSON3, and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 were well - aware of it. They would sit close together so she didn't have much room, and they would look at her with disinterest and not laugh when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong.  We were sitting on the deck of the boat, chatting about movies, and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about a movie that she'd just seen and had now become her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to even crack a smile. @PERSON4 looked off into the distance, lost in her own thoughts. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes at me. Suddenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened in surprise, then she looked down at the ground, clearly disappointed. Without thinking, I laughed and gently reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way her face lit up at that simple act of kindness. She smiled brightly and began to gush about how amazing the movie was with renewed enthusiasm. @PERSON1 continued her story while secretly watching @PERSON3 and me.  Later that day, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I made the decision to move and sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever
339	21137	8	3	My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer.
340	21138	8	3	"Closer @CAPS1 @CAPS2  In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!"
341	21140	8	3	Laughter...What exactly is laughter? Laughter is that magical force that makes the world go round. It's the very essence that makes friendships and relationships truly click. Laughter can even pave the way from romance straight to marriage. Without laughter, people would be constantly sad and deeply depressed. They'd be clumsily stubbing their feet as they walked. People would be under stress all the time, and there would be a lot more wars. Simply put, the world would not be able to survive without laughter. That is the profound truth I know about laughter.
342	21141	8	3	"Laughter, an incredibly important part of life, offers a comforting feeling just by the act of laughing because, in that moment, everything seems okay. Laughing has this amazing ability to bring people together, making them share in the joy of laughter. It's like a unique form of communication. Once you start laughing about something, others around you start to laugh too, and it connects everyone in a shared state of happiness. It's as if you're silently telling everyone to be happy without uttering a single word. That's the power of laughing with others, but when they laugh at you, well, that's a completely different story. I remember one particular day when I was at home doing the dishes. Everyone in my family was feeling frustrated, and I was no exception. I really hate being angry, and I also hate it when others get angry. So, I said something (I can't quite remember what it was), and suddenly, everyone started laughing. It instantly put everyone in a great mood. I like to think of laughing as a fire. One single candle can light many other candles. When you hear people laughing, the first thought that pops into your mind is, ""Something must be really funny."" And you naturally want to go and find out what it is so you can join in the laughter. This is a very common reaction for most people who love laughing. Personally, I absolutely adore laughing because it gives me this wonderful, slightly strange feeling. It's a feeling that makes life more enjoyable and worth living."
343	21142	8	3	"Laughter between two people serves as one of the clearest indicators that you're truly good friends. When you're having a really bad day, the shared laughter between each other can instantly cheer you up. It's the very reason you know you've established a great bond in your relationship. Laughter is the strong bond that ties my two best friends and me together. It's the secret behind our long - standing friendship. One of my best friends is named @PERSON1, and the other is @PERSON3. I've been friends with them for @NUM1 years now. We're all extremely close, and we do absolutely everything together. We hang out regularly, we play soccer as a team, we live in close proximity to each other, and, most importantly, we laugh together all the time. @PERSON1 loves going camping with her family during the @DATE1. For the past @NUM2 years, she's kindly invited @PERSON3 and me to join her. On our last trip, I was texting quite a bit because I was the only one who had service at the campsite. @PERSON1's mom got annoyed and yelled at me for texting so much, which made me a bit angry. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 sided with @PERSON1's mom and also yelled at me. I shouted back because I didn't like the way they were all ganging up on me. I said, ""I know, I'm getting off the phone. Just shut up!"" They were both really taken aback by my outburst and became a bit intimidated. We all fell silent, and the atmosphere was really awkward for a little while. Then, our friend @PERSON2, who was also on the trip, attempted a cartwheel and ended up falling flat on his face. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and I tried hard not to laugh because we were still mad at each other, but it was just too hilarious. So, we couldn't hold it in any longer and burst out laughing. In that moment, we realized that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew that a small fight like that couldn't possibly break our friendship. We all hugged each other and apologized. This is precisely why laughter is such an amazing thing. There's nothing better than having friends who are always there for you and can make you laugh even when you're mad at them. Laughter can strengthen the bond between friends and repair any damage that has occurred in a relationship. In my case, laughter has fixed many such problems and will continue to do so in the future."
344	21143	8	3	Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I can't seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it becomes difficult to find common ground between us. When I reflect on my friendships, it brings back all the wonderful memories filled with joyous laughter over the years and months. The simple things in life that make me happy often trigger laughter. Whenever differences surface in friendships, all it takes is a memory that made us laugh to reignite that friendship. Whenever I'm with my best friend, @PERSON1, things that usually aren't funny at all become hilarious. Another factor is that @PERSON1 and I don't hang out as often as we did when we went to the same school @DATE1 @DATE1. So, the time apart makes us cherish our moments together even more. Three nights ago, I went to dinner with @PERSON1 and her mom at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Throughout the dinner, we had numerous laughing sessions. People around us either think we're really annoying because we can't stop laughing, or they understand what it's like to have a best friend who can brighten your @DATE2 and think we're funny. There has never been a real fight between @PERSON1 and me because we've become so close over the @DATE1 and realized how much alike we are, like twins. So, conflicts rarely arise. However, one of my other close friends, @PERSON2, who goes to my previous school with @PERSON1, has been having issues with @PERSON1. The most important thing to me is that they get along because they're two of the most important people in my life. I'd do anything to make them become friends again, even though I might not have the power to do so. I can get close to both of their hearts and maintain a level of laughter, shared secrets, and wonderful memories. But when they're not on good terms, it's not easy to bring them together. I was with @PERSON2 @TIME1, so I understood how she felt, just as I understood @PERSON1, who I was with at the moment. I tried to briefly bring up the subject, and at first, she refused to talk about it. I knew that @PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and that they'd only had a small, silly argument. The problem is that both of them can be very stubborn. In any argument, neither of them will be the first to say they're sorry because they both think they haven't done anything wrong. In this case, it was just a minor miscommunication. I ended up explaining to @PERSON1 in more detail how @PERSON2 was feeling because I could really relate. Once I got her laughing, she started to see things from @PERSON2's perspective. The key to my friendships is definitely laughter, especially while we're young. I wouldn't have been able to get @PERSON1 to listen to my view on @PERSON2's feelings if I hadn't used things that made her laugh. I told her things that made her giggle and brought back memories of the good times the three of us had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't ready to immediately run up to @PERSON2 and hug her and make peace, she was willing to consider communicating with @PERSON2 again. That was enough to make me feel good. For the rest of the @TIME2, we put aside the drama, relaxed, and had a great time. We played our favorite songs and laughed about the smallest things or the mistakes we made when talking to each other. I know that as I grow older, I'll look back on my two best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, and realize how they made my high school years truly amazing. They helped me become a better person, someone who can fully enjoy life by being in the right company and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be great friends with multiple people, and even if they don't get along, you can find a balance and not leave anyone out. In the end, the most important thing is to be a good friend to everyone and not be selfish. Laughter has led me to understand this important lesson.
345	21144	8	3	Close people to you cherish the moments you've shared with them, and recalling those moments brings laughter for what transpired in that time. Laughter has the power to bring together people you've known for a long time because it evokes the feelings associated with that person and the moment. Laughing at the memories spent with someone and truly enjoying them can strengthen your bond with that person and is crucial for the relationship. In fact, this has happened to me. Laughter filled my heart when I watched a special video from my past. It was from a family party when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and I was three. My cousin was very chubby with straight hair, but that day, she was terribly sick with a fever. I was quite different, with curly hair and a short stature. We both had dresses on, but they were of different styles. Everyone at the party was having a great time, and so were we. The video reached the part where my cousin and I were bouncing up and down, grabbing our dresses, and putting on a little show for everyone. At that time, we were supposed to be dancing. It seemed we were having an absolute blast that day. Then, my youngest brother came over to watch us dance. He was holding a cup of soda. Just then, one of the grown - ups got up from their chair and accidentally bumped into him. He dropped his cup of soda, and it splashed all over my cousin and me. Our dresses were instantly wet, dirty, and sticky from the soda. We stopped dancing, sat down on the ground, and started to cry. My aunt and my mom quickly changed our clothes. Later, when we saw my brother, we were so angry that we ignored him when he tried to talk to us. But as time passed, we started having fun again and eventually forgave him. Finally, the video ended. It's truly important that laughter can bring people closer together because it creates a wonderful shared moment. My cousin and I watched the video and laughed at our past selves. We shared the same feelings and the innocence of that age. We noticed how much we've changed since then, looking back at all the funny times we had. We also realized that it wasn't really my brother's fault that we got splashed. Laughing at those shared moments helped my cousin and me become even more united. Obviously, as we grow older, our reactions change, but laughter, whether in the moment or later, has the power to bring people together. Sometimes, our feelings may vary over time, but laughter remains important because it allows us to share moments of happiness with others. I often remember events from my past with my family, and these memories bring us closer and fill us with laughter for the happy times we've had. Laughter is truly a precious gift that enriches our relationships and makes life more beautiful.
346	21145	8	3	"I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. It's that genuine, warm feeling that bubbles up from deep within. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and, how they feel about you. When that person makes you laugh, you know that they really love you and care about you. When you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person. Laughter is from the heart and soul, a pure expression of connection. When that person tells you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings, those unspoken emotions, are a lot between two people. Joy, that feeling of happiness, is from the soul and down deep within your body. As my mom would say, joy helps clear the mind and body, but what I really think is that when someone makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. You laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone makes you laugh. When it says it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about joy is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and, then if it is funny then you start laughing about it. Here is what my mom used to say to everyone is that ""if you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples' lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, I think laughter is just a feeling that people have. You might tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any sense at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start laughing because one of them decided that it was too quiet and we all needed a laugh. There are sometimes you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell myself almost everyday that if I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. When you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but I'm a teenager what do you think I will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I'm not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally understand the joke. I know I am a bit slow, but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are slow and I also have slow jokes about me and I really do not mind when people tell slow jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got used to it. When I heard my first slow joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they were trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like ""Hey, I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. When you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves, or someone that is related to them. When you laugh is like your showing your feelings and, trust to that person, because if you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they were trying to tell you. I will always tell myself if I need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning. Because for some odd reason I think I am just really funny looking. Most people think that if you look at yourself and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non - stop. The reason I laugh is because I see or hear something really funny or just wanna laugh so much. If I have a good day or a good weekend I laugh a lot. Laughter truly enriches our lives and relationships, making every moment more memorable and meaningful."
347	21146	8	3	"Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It's a powerful tool that can create bonds and leave lasting impressions. It is also a key component to story - telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if you're sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face. As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching an exciting @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movie and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 delicious cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven - year - old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flour out. From now on I will never think of flour in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flour all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day. Let's just say it was a disaster, enough flour to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flour into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flour went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flour, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""Clean this up right now! I was upstairs for an hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world. It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flour for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split - second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That day had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @PERSON1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"". Slowly we climbed the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flour in your hair"". From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story. Laughter truly has the power to turn a messy situation into a cherished memory."
348	21147	8	3	"Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all I wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1 do before his final days. I remember when I was about five years old I loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as I had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, carefully showing me how to create depth, texture, and the overall image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the big smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time I was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but I can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot I wish I got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing by the calm lake, or even camping in the beautiful forest. Yet there is a lot I did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. He painstakingly added colors and details to make it look amazing. Whenever I had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how I did, and for some odd reason I got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, I named him when I was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa, @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpa's favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandma's slippers in the bedroom. When I lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school I would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until I was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework, patiently explaining the difficult concepts, and cook dinner and then afterwards grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When I was young I would go over to their house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent I didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I can't take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and I stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I was younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time I didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but I knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, I was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job I had on the eastern part of the state, I was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had seen him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away. Laughter with my grandparents was a precious part of my life, and those memories will always be cherished."
349	21148	8	3	Laughter. Laughter is a key
350	21149	8	3	"Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong."
351	21150	8	3	A few years ago, me, my mom, and my sister @PERSON1 were at a cozy sub shop for a delicious dinner. While we were patiently in line, waiting for our mouth - watering sandwiches, @PERSON1, who was several inches shorter than me at that time, playfully said that she was taller than me. So, I straightened up and firmly said that I was still taller. Then she stood up on her tip - toes, making her taller than me for a moment, and cheekily said that she was too taller than me and stuck her tongue out at me. In response, I stood up on my tip - toes, making myself taller again, and stuck out my tongue at her. The funny part is that there was this cute guy standing right behind @LOCATION1. So, it looked like I was sticking my tongue out at him! He had this amused look on his face, as if he was looking at some cute little kid. I quickly stuck my tongue back in my mouth and returned to my normal height. I then told my mom that @PERSON1 and I were going to find a place to sit. Once we found a nice spot to sit, I told her about the guy standing behind her, and we both laughed heartily. It was really funny, and we still joke about it! : ).
352	21151	8	3	"Laughter can create this type of strong bond that's extremely hard to sever. I can vividly tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the same silly things. It's an amazing phenomenon when people laugh. It doesn't always make perfect sense or seem that incredibly funny at the moment, but I think it will make anyone feel better no matter what the difficult circumstance is. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by sharing laughter at the same things. Or how laughter can mend a fight that you and a loved one have had. Well, here it goes, my story of a very true and very close - to - home incident that helped me open my mind and gain one of the best and most genuine friends I'll ever have in my life. To tell this story, I have to go back in time to when I was around nine or so. When I was a young girl, my sister, @CAPS1, or as I always affectionately called her @PERSON2, and I despised each other. We never got along well. Maybe that's because of sharing a room with an older sister. I can clearly remember her never wanting to play with me or hang out with me. My oldest sister @PERSON1 had just gone to college, so my sister @PERSON2 and I got the chance to get to know each other a whole lot more. Sure, we still had heated fights and still didn't get along with each other very harmoniously, but we were well on our way to becoming the best friends we are today. Well, one day when my parents went out shopping, my sister @PERSON2 and I stayed home to clean the house. In my family, when cleaning, loud music is blasting, no matter what kind it is. As always, my big sister had to ""order"" me around, or at least that's what it felt like then. And like always, I was a stubborn little sister who never liked taking orders from the big sister. Well, @PERSON2 told me I had to clean the bathrooms, and I really hate to clean bathrooms. I mean, who likes it, right? So I told her that I wouldn't clean them... well, that didn't go over so well with the big sister who was in charge while mom and dad were away. So we started to fight, and oh what a furious fight that was. I mean, it was as loud as it could be. The music couldn't even be heard over the intense yelling and screaming. Like most fighting in my house goes, my sister and I got so fed up with each other that we stormed out of that room and into our own bedrooms. While the music was still loudly playing and could even be heard from all the way upstairs. So as I, and I can only guess my sister was doing the same, was plotting my revenge on my oh - so ""wise"" sister, then the music changed to an upbeat classic song that is one of the most popular songs in my household. This song was ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". Because I loved this song so much, I opened my door to my bedroom. I guess my sister is like me because she did the same. Well, I had started singing and dancing in my room to the music, and guess my sister had heard me because she had come out of her room and into mine. I of course didn't notice her so I kept on singing and dancing. Well, as soon as she started to laugh at me, I stopped and glared at her. @CAPS1 just stood there laughing. I had said something along the lines of well, you couldn't do better than that. So she tried, and it was my turn to laugh. We ended up making fun of each other's dances and laughed all the way downstairs where we hugged and said how sorry and stupid we were for fighting. Then after all that had just happened, we looked around us at the work still left to be done. We then looked at each other and laughed and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home. We finished just in time. As soon as my mom and dad came home, we were just doing the last bit of cleaning. That night after my mom and my dad had gone to bed, my sister and I had a great time watching movies and laughing our heads off. That's it, my story of how sisters, or more like best friends, can fix a rift and start anew with just laughter and having fun together. Now my sister lives in @LOCATION1, so I don't see her a lot, but whenever I can, I web - chat with her or call her. We spend hours laughing. It doesn't even matter what we are laughing about. That's what laughter does. It creates this deep bond, a strong connection. My sister and I have had our fights in the past... and will likely have them in the future, but we have laughter that always helps us stay close no matter what happens in life."
353	21153	8	3	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I firmly think that laughter is truly important in any aspect, in any kind of relationship. When people laugh, they get to understand each other better. Usually, people think that you are a cool person when you say something funny and laugh with them when they say funny stuff. It's much more fun to be with people who are laughing with you or make you laugh. There were many times throughout my life when numerous problems were solved by just telling a witty joke, saying something humorous, or even recalling fun memories from the past. I have many friends that I love dearly, but of course, like in any other friendship, we've had minor disagreements between us. I remember one time when my friends and I went to hang out at the bustling mall. Two of my friends got into a huge conflict because of something really strange, which later escalated into a heated argument. Of course, we always had small conflicts, but this time I guess the two girls were really serious and mad at each other! My other friend @PERSON1 and I were looking at them and didn't know what to do. And my friend @PERSON1 was kind of scared that they might hurt each other. I told them, ""Hey, you guys! Don't be like that!"" They looked at me and stopped. So we started to walk. Then I remembered something funny and crazy that those two girls and us did at a camp the week before this incident happened. After that camp, I remember how they were saying how we are going to be ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 For @CAPS5"" for our whole lives and that they wouldn't forget how much fun we had. I started to laugh, recalling what we did at that camp, and they looked at me like I was weird or something. So I reminded them about all that fun stuff we did, and they looked at each other and started to laugh really hard! Because their conflict had something little to do with that camp, which they had forgotten! After that, they started to talk to each other and forgot about that conflict that they had. Sometimes I remind them about the conflict, but they just laugh and say ""We were so dumb to make that conflict!"" And we all laugh at them. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" This is why I think that laughter is really important in any friendship. And I think that this problem was solved by just sharing some funny memories so they could laugh! And by reminding someone of a thing that they had forgotten."
354	21154	8	3	"Laughter is of key importance in life, within the family, and in relationships. It gets people through tough times and those moments when you just need a friend by your side. Laughing is a significant part in my life. I love joking around and having a great time. When something unpleasant happens, I try to cover it up with laughter. Some people sometimes say that I laugh too much in certain situations, but it gets a lot of people through tough spells. If there was no laughter in the world, it would be dull, and I feel that people would miss out on really experiencing the joy of laughing and making jokes. Making other people laugh gives me a wonderful feeling, even if it is a rather lame joke. I think that's because it gives me a good sense of self - worth, as it's one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type. We love messing around and just laughing about everything. There have been a lot of wonderful memories with my family and me, filled with jokes and such. We cherish every little laughing moment because it's something we all treasure, and it's a bond that we don't want to break. One moment in my life where laughter was really beneficial was in awkward situations with people. On my sports team, we tend to get down on ourselves very quickly during games, and we start to blame other people, which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in such situations. This causes so many errors, and my teammates and I are just not paying attention to one another and not acting like a team. After losing so many games, you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always tries to comfort us by saying we did well or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously, while others don't care and act as if nothing ever happened. Those people start to shut others out and only care for their close friends on the team. One morning before we even started, the atmosphere was tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members were talking about her, and she confronted them, saying ""If you're going to talk about me behind my back, just say it to my face."" They were in complete shock, and no one knew what to say. So I stated, ""Well, this is just awkward."" The whole team just started to laugh because it relaxed the situation. Even though it didn't totally solve things, it just made the situation a little more bearable. Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being stuck in the car with my family while going somewhere and on the way back is a great bonding time. You start to talk in a crazy way, not making any sense, and not being your usual self. Then it brings out the fun of messing around, and when you say or do something, it becomes really funny, and it's a moment that you don't want to lose. An example that happened to me on this experience was when we were going to @LOCATION1 and we made up a lot of inside jokes about the things we saw or heard. Moments like these I always want to cherish because these people in your life right now won't always be there. To create memories, just do the simple thing and laugh with your family and friends."
355	21155	8	3	"The @CAPS1 Of @DATE2 The warm @DATE2 sun shone brightly, the inviting pools were there to cool down excited children, parents were joyfully joining with friends and family to have delicious picnics and potlucks, and there were late - night slumber parties filled with fun. Then there's my @DATE2 @CAPS1. The sunshine came in brightly through the window, illuminating the whole room. I woke up to see the brilliant light of the sun. I excitedly ran into my brother @PERSON2's room to make sure he was up and ready to start the exciting day with me. He clearly was; he was always the early riser. We left his room and started to smell the sweet aroma of freshly - baked chocolate chip cookies. We quickly rushed down the hall into the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there, mom turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my soon - to - be baby brother. We asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed at her answer, she had nothing planned. My brother and I were bummed, but we quickly got dressed and went to the backyard where we were pitching the ball to each other. The ball hit softly on my nice leather glove, while on my brother's it made a sharp slap. My mom came outside and yelled to @PERSON2 to go over to the sliding glass door. For a second, I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard to @PERSON2, but luckily that wasn't the case. My mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over. My first thought was ""Great, @ORGANIZATION2's coming over!"" Then I started to think, my cousin @ORGANIZATION2 is so weird... she is always making up lies, telling unfunny jokes, playing with @PERSON1 @CAPS2 cards, and playing weird, stupid video games. I quickly asked my mom when she is coming so I can prepare myself for whatever I am going to have to put up with. My mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly run past her into my room where my phone is and call my"
356	21156	8	3	"It was a cloudy @DATE1, a day with a soft, overcast sky that cast a gentle gray hue over everything. But nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, enjoying each other's company, sharing laughter and stories. And now, they were heading home. I was among this group as a young @CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, always keeping to myself, but something changed that. The group was called @ORGANIZATION2. This @ORGANIZATION2 was for teenagers and even some college students. There were very few of us though, just a small, close - knit bunch. It was our last year as @ORGANIZATION2, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be our best and last @ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At first, @CAPS2 the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @CAPS6 in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know @PERSON3 the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys.  After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the @DATE1 before @DATE1, so our @ORGANIZATION2 leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 candy hearts that said, ""@CAPS1"". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @PERSON1 that said, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"".  Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart @CAPS2, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON4 saying it was from @PERSON2 that said, ""@CAPS7 @NUM1 @CAPS4"". Whenever we had one that said, ""@CAPS9"", then we would give it to @PERSON1 saying it was from @LOCATION1. Earlier she had said to him, ""I thought you were @CAPS10 for a moment there"", but numerous people thought she said, ""I thought you were @CAPS9 for a moment there."" So, we try to make it up to @PERSON1 for @PERSON2 by giving him ""@CAPS9"" candy hearts.  We ended that @DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person @CAPS11, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer.  In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who you're laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter."
357	21157	8	3	"Sound @CAPS1, usually a sign of playfulness, @CAPS2 someone hears something funny, said person begins to laugh. @CAPS2 the funny thing being heard was someone else laughing, the whole room begins to engage in laughter. This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was @CAPS2 I began making strange noises. I normally make sound @CAPS1 and such @CAPS2 I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @DATE1, it was my birthday, so I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON4 and @PERSON3, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no - brainer.  Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over - sized @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3. It was a large funnel with flashing red and @CAPS15 lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we'd leap from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, @CAPS2 we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON4 asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn't help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, ""@CAPS4 want me to ride down with @CAPS4 ladies?"" @CAPS2 he said that, @PERSON3 was the first to break. Then me. Then @PERSON4. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me.  ""That dude looks like @PERSON1 @PERSON1!!"" I screamed to @PERSON3. @CAPS2 the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he @CAPS8 look like @PERSON1. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had its tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. @CAPS6 just happened? @CAPS8 I seriously just...just...@CAPS9?! Note: A best friend will always be there for @CAPS4, especially @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @CAPS8 something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at one's strangeness.   So of course, @PERSON4 was the first to say, ""@CAPS6 the heck was that?""  @CAPS7 followed by @PERSON3's expression of, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4 just @CAPS9?"" That's @CAPS2 we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel @CAPS2 we got off the inter tube.  Later after we had our fill of the @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3, @PERSON4 decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, @PERSON3 and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song ""@CAPS11"" by @PERSON2. @PERSON3 is my go - to - gal @CAPS2 it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But @CAPS2 it got to the chorus, ""I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..."" we all said, ""I throw my banana in the air sometimes...""  ""@CAPS12 my @CAPS13, we should totally make a song of our own."" @PERSON4 said.  We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly @CAPS6 to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terrible noise arrived again. @PERSON4 began to laugh, then @PERSON3 and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my @CAPS9. @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 continued to laugh at my sound @CAPS1. I joined in with them, laughing at myself.  That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15"" out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound @CAPS1."
358	21158	8	3	"How @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only took one @DATE3 to change the whole purpose of my @CAPS1. Two things that made my @CAPS1 more than I ever thought @CAPS3 could be; @CAPS4 and one girl. I realized over just one @DATE3 that there is more to @CAPS1 than what we see or hear. Emotions that you can't describe. Something that you have to live out for yourself. Looking back on three months of @CAPS1 - changing events, I laugh at how fast my @CAPS1 turned and started heading the right way. Also how one girl can bring me to church and how @CAPS4 can keep a relationship moving strongly. We're part of a movement that will last forever. Her and I moving on the perfect path to eternity with each other. Have you ever had a person in your @CAPS1 that made you so overwhelmingly happy that @CAPS3 caused you to change your @CAPS1 plan forever? I have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I ever saw this girl. @CAPS3 was like an instant shock through my body. @CAPS3 felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear, ""go get her."" One day talking to my friend about this girl I couldn't get out of my head. I told him how I was going to talk to her @DATE4 and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @CAPS6 said, ""I have a class with her.""  @CAPS6 thought about her and I together; like in a relationship. In an intense thought @CAPS6 looked up at me and said, ""actually I think you guys would be perfect together."" @CAPS7 that @CAPS6 said that I said, ""sweet."" I talked to her that day. She was better than I expected. I needed back - up though. I had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk over. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, ""what a great friend."" @CAPS3 was me alone with seven other girls. Trying to look the best I could look. What @CAPS7 me is I actually pulled @CAPS3 off. She actually thought I was attractive. Was @CAPS3 love at first sight? I don't know you tell me. Getting close to @DATE3. I got my license. Looking forward to what my @DATE3 was going to look like. All was looking really good. Until I found a job at an ice - cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME1 wasn't the best way to start out my @DATE3. I still wanted to impress her and be with her all @DATE3. I met a guy named @PERSON1. @CAPS6 asked if I wanted to study the bible with him. I knew that @PERSON2 went to the same church. So I wanted to do @CAPS3.  About two months @DATE2 they went to a church thing over in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 was baptized there. Then @DATE2; after they got back. I was baptized. We both had @CAPS4 with us. Love was building up between us. What better to do than date? We started dating on @DATE1. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like fire burning in her eyes with love. Going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  Still with love burning inside of us. I went to her house. Lost track of time and noticed"
359	21159	8	3	"My cousin @PERSON1 and her boyfriend, @PERSON2, had been dating for three years and they had planned a special date for their anniversary. They made reservations at the @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1 and then take a walk on the beach after-wards. For @PERSON1 this was a small step up from an ordinary date but for @PERSON2 this was the biggest day of his life. This late @DATE2 evening was the day he would ask @PERSON1 to be his wife! @PERSON2 pulled up to @PERSON1's house at precisely five-o'clock pm. In his hands he held a bouquet of roses which were handed to the most beautiful girl on the @ORGANIZATION1. She was dressed in a white and pink dress with matching pink heels and her hair was all done up fancy. @PERSON2 was speechless as he handed her the bouquet. After the roses were placed in some water, he escorted her down the steps to his car, @CAPS1 number one. @PERSON2 couldn't start his car. In utter embarrassment @PERSON2 asked @PERSON1 to drive her car to dinner. She giggled and assured him that she didn't mind. When they arrived at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 they were sad to find that their reservation had been double booked and the other couple had arrived only moments before them. In despair, they set off in search of something else. Everything else that @DATE1 @TIME1 seemed to be full so @PERSON1 decided on @CAPS2's, her favorite restaurant. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting to be seated they were lucky enough to get a window seat. @PERSON2 ordered a burger and fries because he is not a seafood fan. In contrary, @PERSON1 loves seafood so she had a bowl of @CAPS2's world famous clam chowder. When dinner was finished @PERSON2 excused himself to use the restroom before they left but as he was getting up, he knocked over his @ORGANIZATION3 and it spilled all over @PERSON1's new dress, creating a brown, sticky mess. @PERSON1 cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use. So far so bad, but the worst was still yet to come. When they came to pay the bill @PERSON2 began panicking. He realized that he had left his wallet in his car! @PERSON2's face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill. Good thing we didn't go to the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2! he thought. @PERSON1 was ready to go home but @PERSON2 was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set. She agreed. With @CAPS6 step, @PERSON2's heart began to beat faster, his throat dry, his hands sweat, and his body shake. They sat on the warm sand and talked for ten minutes. Finally @PERSON1 was really ready to go so this was his last chance. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the lone ring. As he got on one knee, the ring fell into the sand. It was getting dark so after a minute or two of frantic searching, he gave up and began to cry. @PERSON1 was so confused and thought he was crying because she wanted to leave but as soon as @PERSON2 calmed himself he told his story and how this was supposed to be the perfect proposal for the perfect girl but it turned out the be the worst @TIME1 of his life. @PERSON1 just laughed which made @PERSON2 think she was mocking him but he continued anyway. ""@PERSON1, will you be my wife?"" @CAPS4 tears of joy she said, ""@CAPS5! As long as @CAPS6 day can be an adventure like tonight."" @CAPS6 time they mention this story they bust out laughing even though it wasn't funny at the time. Ever since then they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now."

As soon as we we walked the three mile walk to get to @PERSON1's house @LOCATION1 realizes that he forgot his phone charger at my house. We didn't want to walk all the way back to my house and we had no ride either because none of us have our license yet and and @PERSON1's parents aren't home. So @PERSON1 and i start brainstorm on how to get back to my house to retrieve @LOCATION1's cell phone charger, when suddenly...We heard a loud bang come from the backyard from the old rugged y shed in the back dark corner of the yard; @LOCATION1 and I go to check it out to see what the noise was. we open the shed and one of @PERSON1's dirt bikes had fallen over. @PERSON1 and I pull the dirt bike out of the old spider-web infested shed. @PERSON1 and i both got a light-bulb above our heads and suddenly looked up at each other with the same idea. not being so smart we figure @LOCATION1 can just ride the dirt bike the three mils back to my house on main roads and he will be fine. @PERSON1 tells @PERSON1 about are idea and @PERSON1 says its a bad idea because he mom is not home and he doesn't want us getting in trouble for a phone charger. @PERSON1 repeatedly tells us to put the dirt bikes back, but next thing you know @LOCATION1 has the bike out front testing it out around the neighbor hood. I tell @LOCATION1 ""since there is only one dirt bike you take it and ill follow on the @CAPS1 bike!"" next thing you know me and @PERSON1 are side by side riding a dirt bike and a @CAPS1 bike down the busiest road in town and its pitch black outside. ""@PERSON1 you go and ill meet you there!"" i yell. @PERSON1 takes off down the road at about @NUM1 mph and im about @NUM1 yards behind him. suddenly I see a white figure start to creep out from a driveway, i cant quite make out what it is... When suddenly i see flashing red and blue lights! i try to warn @LOCATION1 and shout ""@PERSON1 @NUM3!!!"" yet he is to far away to hear me but since its pitch black outside the lights light up the whole street, @LOCATION1 tries to loose him by going down a side road but its no match for a charger cop car. It's out of my hands now so I bike back to jeremys house and get him and we run the the scene of the crime to see whats happening. we keep are distance and act like we don't know him. the cop has @PERSON1 in cuffs standing behind the cop car and the cop goes back to his car to write @PERSON1 a ticket and I see @LOCATION1 shadows under the street light throw something into the bush's.. Since it wasn't his dirt bike and he couldn't ride it him the cop calls a tow truck and has him take the bike and the cop gives @LOCATION1 a ride home with @MONEY1 in tickets.. As soon as they leave the scene I go check to see what @LOCATION1 threw in the bush's and it was a can of chew because he is a minor.. so i grab it. the next day @LOCATION1 is home and his parents are at work so I bring him his chew, and he starts to tel us what his mom punished him with when suddenly we heard the garage door start to open; his mom was home from work so i hand him his chew and I run out the backyard and over the fence. he tells me to not tell to many people because he doesn't want everyone knowing but its already the talk of the town..."
361	21161	8	3	"It was a day like any other. I was going to the well - known chess club with a determined heart to challenge the board one holder. I had never actually met him before as I was a new face in the club. But I knew clearly that if I didn't play at my absolute best, I would surely lose. I entered the room with a secret hope that the holder was not there, but alas, he was. He, @CAPS2, had on a vivid blue baseball cap, a simple blue t - shirt, a pair of well - worn blue jeans, and a pair of sturdy black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if he had not brushed it in ages. His skin was extremely pale, and I couldn't help but wonder how he could go out in the sun without any form of sun protection. The board was neatly set up and ready for battle, and @CAPS1 was the time - keeper, the clock. The clock had an hour allotted on each side. I walked up to him. @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, "" @CAPS1 @CAPS12 gonna beat me fast. I know I'm gonna lose."" @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me as if I had deeply insulted him. "" @CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 scoffed, ""you're the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would matter, but I was playing him, and I was absolutely certain that it was or was going to matter very soon. ""@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS1."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to move like lightning, I moved my piece. It was a bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not my turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons. @CAPS2 didn't even look like he cared about the game and whether a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down, the clock showed fifty to fifty - five. I was already down on time, and the game hadn't even really begun. @CAPS8 picked up the king's bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was weird; he moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for what felt like a very long time. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible. I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and hadn't even moved one lousy piece. I picked up my king's pawn and moved it up two squares, hoping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt me in this game. I hit my clock. We sat there for what must have been half an hour. I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back, I checked on how the other players were doing. Only one game was done; it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, and it was the kid I didn't know. As odd as that was, I had to get back to my game. @CAPS2 still hadn't moved. For a minute, I thought he was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird; he just did a fool's move. I didn't think for a minute. I picked up my queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10."" in a loud voice. @CAPS2 started to laugh. At first, I was confused as I thought I had beaten him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""I do this with everyone I play for the first time, this opening."" @CAPS2 started to laugh again. This time, I joined him, and we both were laughing because I had beaten him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me. I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really he had been giving people games, and they didn't know it. We started to laugh again. The coach came over and saw that I won. @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, ""This is the start of a new beginning. I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me."" @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that he wanted me on board one. Now, I'm on board one, and my new friend, @CAPS8, is there with me on board two."
362	21163	8	3	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many people firmly say that laughter is the key to a fulfilling life. If you can't laugh, then you are not likely to be a fun person to be around. Many other people strongly believe that laughter is a very important part of the relationships they are in. In my opinion, I whole - heartedly think that laughter is very important too. It lightens the mood in those truly awkward situations, and laughter also simply makes you and other people genuinely happy. And I personally, would much rather be around a happy person than one that isn't. A few days ago, my mom, sister, and I decided to go to the well - known bowling alley in @LOCATION1. We were all three cordially invited to go, along with about @NUM1 other women from the @ORGANIZATION1 we regularly attend. We attend the @ORGANIZATION1 with enthusiasm. We had all made careful reservations at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 at @NUM2 @CAPS3. We arrived first and sat there patiently and waited for about @NUM3 minutes. Then finally we saw some of our friends walking in. We ran over there excitedly to greet them and to show them where we were sitting. Our friends started getting their bowling shoes from the counter and then they slowly ventured over towards us. Once all our friends got there, we began to bowl. We had a total of three @CAPS2 for everyone. My mom, sister, and I were all three at one lane, and with us were two other friends. The first game we bowled a normal, straightforward game. As usual, everyone was getting strikes except for me. I was getting pretty discouraged. So when our second game came around, we all decided to change the rules up a little bit. This round we could not bowl like we normally do. Each time it was our turn, we had to come up with a new way and a new position of sending the ball down the lane. After a while, everyone was running out of things to try, so people started laying and sitting on bowling balls and then sending a different ball down the lane. That was really, really hard. Towards the end of the second game, everyone was exhausted. Their arms hurt and so did their fingers. My last frame, I got up and picked the ball I wanted to use. I waited for the people in the @CAPS2 next to me to get done with their turn and then I went up to bowl. I got ready, and brought my arm back before I flung the ball down the lane. Just as I did that, my fingers let go of the ball and I dropped it. The whole side of the bowling alley I was on just burst out laughing. I was so embarrassed. My face was beet red. It was horrible. Then on my next turn, I brought the ball back, and then brought it forward and I literally threw it into the other lane. I fell to the floor laughing my head off. It was so funny. That night by far, was the best night I have had in quite a long while."
363	21164	8	3	"The @CAPS1 We @CAPS2 in @CAPS3. Laughter is a commonly used expression in many different ways, such as to release built - up tension, to appreciate a really funny joke, or maybe just to express a light - hearted, giggly mood. I find that laughter is the key to having a close and meaningful relationship with people. It could be because each person's laugh is unique and personal. Every time someone laughs, they aren't thinking about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence. Their guard is completely down for just an instant. Growing up with my father has clearly proven this fact to me. Our relationship is based on laughing our problems or difficulties with one another away. Although I have a good relationship with my @CAPS4, the relationship with my @CAPS7 has always been a silent and guarded one because we have been unsuccessful in bringing humor to the relationship. Which proves to me the point that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a strong bond between two people. Ever since I was a young girl, my father and I have always been very close, and I have begun to realize that whenever I speak of him to an adult or anyone really, they will know him. Everyone always seems to know my @CAPS4. It might be because of his sharp humor, or maybe because older women find him attractive, or maybe because he's genuinely nice. Either way, he's been popular his whole life. Also, ever since I've known my @CAPS4, he has never been much of a serious type of guy. He will make some sort of humorous comment or joke no matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter if I'm sad, or enraged under the spell of my adolescence and hormones. My mood will completely change, and because of this, it has shown me the power of laughter. The relationship between my @CAPS7 and I, however, has always been a rocky one. For several reasons, I'm sure, but one of them I believe is that we were never capable of laughing together or enjoying ourselves. See, she comes from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and in @LOCATION3, things are done a bit differently. Laughing or fooling around, for instance, is considered being disrespectful or immature. Everyone is expected to act properly, and children are to respect their elders. So when my @CAPS4 married her, I introduced her to sarcasm and jokes. I never got the reaction I was looking for, and since there was never that connection through laughs and humor, I felt guarded around her. I have never been able to feel like I can fully express myself around her. I constantly feel judged and awkward, and this has allowed me to see the effects of the absence of laughter. A human being's laughter is emotional and personal, like crying. It immediately allows you to feel happy, sort of like a drug. Once you get someone to laugh, you are allowing them to open up to you in a small way. And not only are they opening up to you, but by the good reaction you received, you begin to create a connection with them. If there is no laughter in a relationship between two people, it tends to get awkward, and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other. Since I am my @CAPS9 daughter, I tend to apply jokes in the same way he does. When there's tension, when someone's upset and I want to immediately solve the problem, I make them laugh. Someone once said that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". How I interpret this quote is that laughter is the one @CAPS1 everyone enjoys doing. It can either build or keep relationships going. It's the one @CAPS1 we will always @CAPS2 in @CAPS3. So c'mon guys, laugh a little."
364	21166	8	3	"The day was not a fun one at all. We all just heard really bad news. None of us were even close to smiling. Not a single one of us. Even the people that you always see with a smile on their face, they had the most serious look on their face. It was just a truly bad day. But then one of our friends, @PERSON1, had a great and brilliant idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was an amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer, just sitting there intently looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about. We were trying our best to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @LOCATION1's house. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching @LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! What a great turn of events. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor, but it fit all three of us perfectly, especially @PERSON1. We were all laughing and having a really good time. @PERSON1 was still laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minutes he was laughing non - stop. When he finally stopped, we asked again. What was so darn funny. Then he told us. "" I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird. "" That's when we all started laughing. How could he be laughing at his own laugh. We soon realized how hard it was to stop. It turned out to be an okay day after all of what had happened. Now, whenever we are having a bad day, we just bring up that day where we laughed at ourselves for ten minutes. And the day is all better."
365	21167	8	3	Recently over the @DATE2 of @DATE1, I was extremely fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom I have never consciously met
366	21168	8	3	I was late, just like usual, for the bus. I barely had any time to sit down before it started moving. As I stepped onto the bus, I saw my friends sitting in seats directly behind one another. I stopped and said to them, “Guys, you all make it so hard to choose.” I forced a sarcastic smile. @PERSON1, who was sitting behind @CAPS3, motioned for me to sit with her. I quickly gave @PERSON1 a smile and told her that @CAPS3 and I would turn around and talk with her. @PERSON1 smiled as @CAPS21 leaned her head against my seat. @CAPS3 and I gave @PERSON1 about five minutes of quiet, then we started chatting with her. By the time we arrived at the middle school, we were all having a great time. Everything was fine until the bus left the middle school. Then, we were in an uproar of laughter! Everything @CAPS21 said made me burst out laughing, and everything I said made her laugh too. After we left the middle school, this little sixth - grader came to sit in front of us. He was incredibly annoying! He kept turning around, giving @CAPS3 and me these weird stares and asking us how many joints we had smoked. Of course, that made @CAPS3 and me crack up even more. I was blabbing about how I had stuff in my biology book, but I was just talking about notes. The boy obviously thought I meant joints. I thought it was absolutely hilarious that he had such a wrong idea. @CAPS3, who was sitting to the left of me, had her head on the seat, crying because she was laughing so hard. Seeing this, I laughed even louder. The sounds coming out of both of us were those silent and deadly laughs. The boy still turned around with those strange stares and raised eyebrows. As soon as we passed the fruit packing company, he started talking to us in @CAPS8. I was trying to learn @CAPS8, but I had no idea what he was saying. Neither did @CAPS3. Of course, he didn't know what he was talking about either. He was leaning over in the aisle to talk to these native @CAPS8 speakers who were also watching us with huge smiles on their faces. Being a bit of a comedian, I decided to start talking about how he couldn't know more @CAPS8 than me when he was only in sixth grade. He quieted right down, but the @CAPS8 speakers were howling with laughter. I was shedding tears by the time @CAPS3 got off the bus. After @CAPS21 got off, I decided to check on ol' @PERSON1. @CAPS21 looked like she was trying to sleep, so I gently nudged her and she looked up at me. I had personally forgotten about @PERSON1 in the back until @CAPS3 got off at her stop. “Are you okay? Do you need a doctor?” @PERSON1 asked with a confused grin on her face. I tried to talk, but I was laughing in between all of my words, so it came out as a jumbled mess. “Now you really scare me!” @PERSON1 retorted with a serious face. “Come on @PERSON1! I'm supposed to scare you! The freshman scare sophomores, sophomores - juniors, and juniors scare the seniors,” I explained, still laughing in between my words. My words still sounded like a jumbled mess. “But you still scare me personally. Don't do that!” @CAPS21 belted out, laughing. I put my face over the seat, then lowered my head so that all @CAPS21 could see were my eyes. I then did my signature wiggling - eyebrow thing where I move my eyebrows from one side of my forehead to the other in a wave motion. I thought I was making her laugh, and I was, but the outburst made even more people look at us. The attention was okay, but the boy still kept interrupting @PERSON1 and me. He would just blurt out, “@CAPS24 bueno? @CAPS24 bueno?” @PERSON1 and I would just look at him. He was soaking up all the attention. Then, I think he insulted my mother, which @PERSON1 pointed out. But I didn't care at that point because I was in such a happy mood. I wasn't going to let someone I didn't even know ruin it. Both @PERSON1 and I looked up to see her stop coming up. It was really something to think back to all we had done together on the bus. The famous disappearing bus driver ride was a hilarious day, and this was the proof - reading my @CAPS19 paper bus ride. Good times. I told her this as @CAPS21 was getting off the bus. She laughed, and so did I. Finally, when the bus reached my stop, I crossed over the road and headed home. For fun, I decided to look back at the bus. I did and saw the boy staring at me. I lost it then and continued laughing all the way home.
367	21170	8	3	I met my best friend @PERSON2 when we were in kindergarten. At that time, we were both shy little kids, and we looked to one another for comfort. Little did we know that the simple acquaintance we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of amazing memories and plenty of laughter. Last @DATE1, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the @DATE2. So, while they were home in @LOCATION4, my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college, so my parents invited @PERSON2 to come along. We were incredibly excited because this was our first time going to @LOCATION3 together. @PERSON2 and I had many activities planned, and I couldn't wait to show her around @ORGANIZATION1 (@LOCATION1 @PERSON1). The only drawback of the trip was that we would be driving, and we would be in the car for about @NUM1 hours. I had known this since we used to go to @ORGANIZATION1 a lot when I was little. So, I brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION1, that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that @PERSON2 and I had quoted each other for. @PERSON2 and I have a really odd sense of humor. We think everything is funny when we're together. It could be the most ridiculous thing, and we would burst out laughing, and no one else would know why. Finally, after a long @NUM1 hours, we arrived in @LOCATION2. It was late, though, and we had to unpack. So, I wouldn't be showing @PERSON2 around until the next day. That didn't mean our night wasn't exciting. In the backyard of the house, there is a pool house. To keep someone at the home when no one is there, my grandparents rent out the pool house. My parents had known that a man named @CAPS1 lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in @ORGANIZATION1. That night, my mom asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready. It was dark outside, so I made @PERSON2 come with me. When we got outside, we saw my dad had introduced himself to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 looked exactly how I had imagined him. He had on red shorts, no shoes, and a peach - colored t - shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy, looking like a big beach bum. @CAPS1 quickly made his way over to me and @PERSON2 and introduced himself. He was really nice and very goofy. Throughout our whole conversation, @PERSON2 and I couldn't keep straight faces. @CAPS1 said that he had to go, so he wanted to teach us a handshake that he made up. He stuck his hand out and curled his index, ring, and middle fingers so that they were in towards his palm, and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb. He gestured us to do the same thing. We all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the center of where we were standing. Then he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs, said good evening, and ran back to the pool house. It was very odd but so funny that my dad, @PERSON2, and I still do this handshake on occasion. The next day, I took @PERSON2 downtown and showed her around. When we were on our way back, we stopped inside a craft store that neither I nor @PERSON2 had ever been in. When we walked in, it looked like any other average craft store. But as we explored a little more, we noticed there was a huge section of armor and helmets that @CAPS3 soldiers wore. Being the big dorks that we are, we decided that we had to put them on. So, we put on the helmets and armor and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people. The ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us, and that had us laughing at ourselves too. We fell down from laughing so hard. At this point, the people who were working were not laughing anymore. They were mad that we had fallen while wearing the armor. They came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip, we had made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion, laughter is very important in relationships. It is healthy and means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel. This @DATE1, @PERSON2 and I will be returning to @LOCATION1 @PERSON1 and are looking forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share, creating more stories to cherish.
368	21171	8	3	In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1. It was a typical family gathering day. Everyone was busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I was just wandering around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I managed to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. Then, out of nowhere, a sudden burst of joy came over me. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without any reason or sanity. I just let myself enjoy it. People in my family looked upon me with confused eyes. They were bewildered by my actions and expressions and kept their distance from me. Though I continued laughing, I still felt a sense of worry. I thought that if I had lost my mind, they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wished would just vanish from my being. Never again would I look into a mirror and see the sane person I used to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, probably due to the strange nature of my conversations and the excuses I made during those short interactions. So, I continued on with my life, once again oblivious to my surroundings, but it was different from my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself being released. A relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders, allowing me to continue with my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowing into my soul. My alter - ego was coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter - ego, I gave the name @PERSON1. With these new emotions that came with it, I accomplished great feats. Even today, he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives me strength by providing a promise of laughter to me and all the peers surrounding me. I view him not as another person but as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such a positive promise. I do believe that we all have this hidden personality within us, empowering us to move forward and never look back. This alter - ego, although strange at first, has become a part of my journey, and I've learned to embrace it as a unique aspect of myself.
369	21174	8	3	Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People. Since the day we were born, laughter has been a part of our lives. Laughter is something truly incredible in the world of human existence. It can relieve awkward situations, bring people together, and make life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others, but still, we can all laugh together. Many times in my life, laughter has helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable. I remember once when I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts, and I was extremely nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these girls before, and now I was going to be competing against them. The only thing I knew was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts went on for the rest of the week, but something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts, and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a bit uncomfortable. After the last practice, it was time
370	21175	8	3	"Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself "" @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing."" @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said "" hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?"" and @CAPS6 laughed. "" @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?"" I replied.  "" @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair."" @CAPS6 said. "" I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass."" I replied. "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go."" @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. "" @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?"" I said "" @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?"" @CAPS6 replied "" The bottle."" I said "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit."" @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says ""@CAPS16"". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, "" that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."""" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway"" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me "" @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke."" "" I had nothing to say"" I replied."" @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl"". @CAPS6 said."" I know, but i cant help it"". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked."" @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew"". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship. Now to me @CAPS2 is an olderto me."
371	21176	8	3	Laughter is how me and my friends connect most of the time, and that's how I became friends with a lot of them. You know when you're in a new class and you don't know anybody there, so it's kinda awkward because you feel like you're a loner. I try to make the best of the situation and try to make new friends, but I'm not always the best at it. So, when I get a chance, I make them laugh. First, we take baby steps, and the more we laugh together, it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester, you don't really like the class, but you don't want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester, you find out you have a class with that person, but they don't like the class, so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other, and if you never talk, then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident. I didn't know many people in the class, and the people that I did know weren't really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two, she made a joke, and I started to laugh. The next thing we know, within a week, we would talk to each other, and soon enough, we hung out some. About half - way through the semester, we would get in trouble in class for talking too much, and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on, and we were hanging out more and more, and she was the only one I would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over, we didn't know what our classes were, so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules, we talked to each other and saw what our classes were. We saw we had one class together, and we were excited. The first day of the second semester, we went into the art class that we had together, and we were laughing the whole time. At the end of the period, she told me she didn't want to be in that class because she's not an artsy type of person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period, I saw her, and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still, but it's not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. It's a couple of weeks into the last semester, and we hardly ever talk. Sometimes it gets awkward just to be around her because it's not like how it used to be. Laughter is how me and her became friends, and classes are what tore us apart. It's a bit sad, but it shows how circumstances can change relationships, even when they start with so much laughter.
372	21177	8	3	"The mood was sweet, and the room was warm with most of my family and friends. Except for my brother, and at the time, I was only about 7 or 8. Hell, I can't really remember, so I'm just going to guess on the age. Whatever, getting back to the story. So, I'm looking all around our two - story house, trying to find my brother, but for some reason, this time it just seems impossible. And all I can hear in the background is my family laughing as this little 7 or 8 - year - old is running full - speed up and down the hallways and opening and closing doors to rooms that he's never been in before. And also shouting at the top of his lungs, ""Brother, where you be at? I can't find you."" And with one more door to open, that's at the beginning of the hallway where everyone is sitting or standing. This little boy comes running down the hall in a panic, who can't find his brother. And opens up the door, and out pops my brother, his brother, who is wearing the scary monster mask and says, ""I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner."" So, now what I did was just as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so fast I ended up throwing up because I was so scared that he was going to come after me that night! And the funny thing is that this happened for the first time of my life, so that's the funny thing. It's a childhood memory that still makes me smile thinking about how easily I was scared back then."
373	21178	8	3	"Is laughter important? In my opinion, laughter is very important! How could laughter affect someone's life? If there was any, or not? Also, is laughter important to me? Laughter is important for so many reasons. In a relationship, in everyday life, and with the ones you have in your life. How would the world be if there wasn't any laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps connect people together if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm, which isn't ""laughter"" but to some people it could be, or some could feel hurt by it. However, most people that feel hurt by it don't have a sense of humor in any way, shape, or form. Most people have heard the saying, ""it takes more muscles to frown than smile,"" and that is a very true and factual fact! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affection that he can be by sharing our laughter together brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if there wasn't for laughter and communication. Having a sense of humor is an important thing in a relationship, to most people. Would you want to be with someone who bores you? Who can't make you laugh when you're sad? I sure wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills. By laughing with someone, it shows your type of opinion on the subject you are talking about. In a relationship, could you imagine if there wasn't any laughter in it? Would you feel the same about the person you're with if there isn't any laughter? How would you feel knowing the person you love isn't very ""humorous"" and doesn't like to laugh often? I couldn't handle that. I would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor. Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be around very ecstatic people than someone who brings me down! I consider laughter to be one of the most important things in my life and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, ""Doesn't it ever get old being happy all the time?"" ""Of course not!"" I would say in defense. Why would someone think that way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time would be the most amazing place I would want to be in my life and with my partner. In my opinion, I would think that almost everyone would feel close to what I'm saying. However, people have their own opinions about laughter and how and if it's important, and they're entitled to their opinion. I know a few people who don't like to be in a very cheery mood, who would prefer to be sad all the time and not care. Laughter could raise you up from that. In conclusion, laughter enriches our lives and relationships, and we should embrace it."
374	21179	8	3	When I think of a day where laughter was the element, I think of June 15th. That was one of the worst days of my life. I had plans to break up with my girlfriend. That morning, my decision was final, and I was going to do it. For some reason, when I woke up, I felt sick. That day, everything was falling apart. Around 3 PM, I went to my girlfriend's house and broke up with her. The next day, I couldn't smile to save my life. The whole day, my friends were making me smile and showing me they cared. They told me funny stories and did silly things. The next day, I felt so much better. I was smiling and laughing like nothing ever happened. All day, my friends were telling me jokes and being really stupid in a fun way. They made me laugh so much. Throughout those upcoming weeks, I met another girl. I couldn't be any more positive about my life. All I do now is just smile and laugh. I don't need to live my life with sadness. All I can do is just be positive and smile. Laughter is very important. No one should go a day without it. Just let's live our lives to the fullest and put the past behind us. Just think on the bright side and smile. Laughter has truly turned my life around, and I'll always cherish its power.
375	21180	8	3	"My high school varsity basketball team isn't the best team, but the one thing that we do have is the ability to make each other laugh. At the start of the school year, the school held try - outs, and the teams were decided. After graduating seniors and some players not coming out, our team was brand new. Full with all different ages of players. We all were civil with each other at practices, but we weren't all best friends that wanted to hang out outside of practice. The varsity team decided to take a retreat to the beach and stay there for a weekend. When we went to leave for the beach, our phones were taken, and we had assigned seats in the cars. This trip seemed like it was going to be a long one without my phone. We arrived at the house at 7 PM. As we all found somewhere to relax, shower, or sleep, myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. We all sat on the floor, recalling stories about the game from that evening or funny stories from our past. By the time we finished telling stories, it had reached 10 PM, and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry. As we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger, we all started to turn our attention to the kitchen. Sarah was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. In her opinion, she thought the house we were staying in should have already been stocked with food for us for when we got there, but there was no food. As she continued on her rant, she became more and more mad, which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally, she reached her point. ""There's no steak or chicken up in these mother - freaking cabinets."" Sarah proclaimed. At that point, the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollably. Sarah didn't understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that there should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes. When we finally started to calm down, Lisa came downstairs. She had missed everything that had happened, and as we went to fill her in, Sarah stopped us. ""Lisa, get up on the counter and look in the cabinet,"" Sarah said. Lisa hesitantly got up on the counter and slowly started to open the cabinet. When she opened the cabinet, she looked inside, and all she could see was chips. She turned around and looked at us. ""What?"" asked Lisa. As she turned to us, Sarah just sat there smiling. Then she finally answered the question. ""Get me some of those chips right there!"" Sarah said. Everyone in the room started laughing as Lisa was so confused as to why she was asked to get up on a counter just so she could get Sarah chips, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole evening. The whole basketball team started laughing again. Lisa got down from the counter but with no chips in hand. We all continued laughing and kept talking about what had just happened for the next 15 minutes. As everyone finally started to settle into their beds for the night, there were still those moments of ""Remember when this was said"", and ""Remember when she did this"". That first night that we spent at the beach did more for us than we realized. By going to the beach and making memories together, we were brought together by two common things. The love for basketball and most of all, the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that night in the kitchen. Today, we still get on each other's nerves, and sometimes we lose our tempers with one another, but we will always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip, and the thing we laugh about the most is what happened that night in the kitchen. These shared moments of laughter have truly strengthened our team bond."
376	21181	8	3	"It was a regular day in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. The sun was shining brightly, and the gentle breeze carried the faint scent of blooming flowers. That special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about it due to the fact that I have always done good on state testing, and never failed at test for state testing. @CAPS22 it was pretty much a regular day for @PERSON1. But I didn't know @CAPS18 awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new @ORGANIZATION1 state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer. The only place in the school that has enough computers for the whole class to take was the either the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, or the old computer lab (I don't know why we used the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, but we did). @CAPS22, I was already in a hyper mood because @CAPS1's sense of humor normally cheers me up and puts me in a hyper mood. @CAPS22, as we were walking to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 started cracking jokes about @PERSON3 mainly because everyone else does, @CAPS22 we just add to the effect. @CAPS19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. @CAPS22 while we waited for @PERSON2 to lock her door and come down to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 made a few more jokes about @PERSON3, but little did I know the real humor was awaiting for me in the computer lab. When @PERSON2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the @ORGANIZATION1 to come in and sit down in the seat I desired. @PERSON4 followed next to me, and @CAPS4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you push @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 and when it goes to a different screen, you push @CAPS8 and it will put the computer to sleep. I tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to pull this trick was to make him forget about it, @CAPS19 do it when he was least expecting it. @CAPS22 about @NUM1 minutes later after I planned my trick, I tried it again. I caught him looking away at @CAPS4. @CAPS22 I pushed @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7. @CAPS19 it went to a different screen and I pushed @CAPS8. My plan had worked. @CAPS19 @PERSON4 turned around right as soon as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out. He started cussing and hitting me. I thought this was mildly funny @CAPS22 I got a couple laughs out of it, but nothing could have prepared me for @CAPS18 was about to happen. After @PERSON4 woke his computer up and got started with his test, @CAPS4 asked @CAPS18 I was laughing about. I told him, ""@CAPS15, you should have seen it. I put @PERSON4's computer to sleep and he flipped out on me."" @CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes went by and @CAPS4 tapped on my shoulder. I looked at him and asked, ""@CAPS18 up kid?"" @CAPS19 @CAPS4 said, ""@CAPS21 this."" @CAPS22 I sat up straight and looked at him. @CAPS19 he asked @PERSON4, ""@CAPS18 did @PERSON1 do to your computer? This?"" and he held the power button down and shut the computer off right in the middle of @PERSON4's test. I thought I was going to cry. It was @CAPS22 funny me and @CAPS4 started laughing as loud as possible. @PERSON2, of course, wasn't happy about it. @CAPS22 she told me and @CAPS4 to quiet down. But it didn't matter. A little scolding didn't compare to how funny it was.  @CAPS22 we ended up going back to our own tests. I hope I do good on this. I really need the grade to pass."
377	21182	8	3	"Have @CAPS3 ever been in that mood where @CAPS3 just can not stop laughing, and no matter what, @CAPS3 just can't stop? That is the problem my good friend, @PERSON1, and I have when we are together. Most of the time we are just talking about random things, like the latest movies or the funny things that happened at school, and we both find it hilarious. Luckily, for the teachers, we only have two classes together. In both of those classes we sit next to each other though. So the teachers didn't luck out too much.  Just the other day, in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we were allowed to move our seats around and have that be our new spot in the class. The girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't like this girl very much, so I spoke up and said ""@PERSON1, @CAPS3 can sit next to me!"". @PERSON1 grabbed her stuff in an unusually quick manner, and came and sat next to me. The funny thing was when she sat down she said ""@CAPS3 saved my life."". For some reason @PERSON1 and I just started laughing non-stop. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @PERSON1 sits next to me in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With out her, it would be so boring.  In @CAPS6, we sit next to each other and we have a good time. Our @CAPS6 class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then. @PERSON1 and I sit next to each other and when we are taking notes, @PERSON1 and I pass notes back-and-forth to each other. She and I talk about everything, from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school, to boys and parents. I can pretty much tell her everything, and that's a good friend. Over the years @PERSON1 and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year, she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we have been in classes together previously. @PERSON1 and I have become more acquainted and more open with things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One reason why I think we've become good friends is because she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things.She is a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend . Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I am going to definitely have to agree with that."
378	21183	8	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air, with a hint of dew and grass, makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again.
379	21185	8	3	"It's true @CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2"" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food, like a bag of hot pretzels. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS3 we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. ""@CAPS3 a matter of fact we do!"" @CAPS7 said enthusiastically. ""We need a ladies costume @CAPS4.""I had absolutely no idea @CAPS8 that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. ""@CAPS5, I can do that. Just one question..."" I said a little confused.""@CAPS6?"" @CAPS7 replied, slightly amused.""@CAPS8 exactly am I going to @CAPS12 doing?"" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS7 could introduce me to, @PERSON1 who would @CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON2 told me the basic idea of the job.""@CAPS9 basically @CAPS8's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS12 in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage."" @CAPS7 said quickly.""@CAPS11 okay, I can do that."" I replied with confidence.@CAPS3 I began to talk to her more about @CAPS8 I would @CAPS12 doing @CAPS7 said that @CAPS7 had to go because break was over. ""@CAPS12 here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!"" @CAPS7 said hurriedly.@CAPS3 @CAPS7 ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice....""I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have"
380	21186	8	3	"In life @CAPS13 share many of your moments laughing and enjoying the sweet and gentle sound of the chorus that @CAPS13 and the people in your life share. Laughter can bring @CAPS13 instantly to enjoyment no matter how unbearable the struggles in your life @MONTH1 be.  I've had many moments in my life that became enjoyable because of laughing and smiling. But one moment sticks out above the others. This moment is the @CAPS1 before my grandpa passed away. This @CAPS1 was the best of all. It was a white @CAPS1, and for once the snow wasn't the only thing that was gleaming. On this day, everyone in my family was smiling, we were all thankful that my grandpa survived his sudden heart-attack that happened the week before and we all knew that his time was near. We had to make his last @CAPS1 a great one to end on.  My grandpa was the sweetest old man, he could always make @CAPS13 smile no matter how sad @CAPS13 were. He was a man, who enjoyed the laughter of his grandchildren and he made sure that he made an impact in our lives. This @CAPS1 though was one where our laughter made the largest impact.  On @DATE1, everyone on my dad's side of the family drove over the hills to their destination; my house. The house was covered in @CAPS1 decor and was gleaming with the happiness that each one of us held inside of us. My grandpa was the first to walk in. I leaped into his arms and said ""I love @CAPS13 grandpa with all my heart! Merry @CAPS1!"" @CAPS8 this he smiled and began to tickle me like he always did ever since I was little. He grabbed my hands and began twirling me around, humming his favorite song. As we were twirling to the tune of his favorite song, my laughter broke out. When this happened, I looked straight into my grandpa's eyes and saw the love that he had. He always said that ""The laughter of a young child can always bring joy to anyone, even the cruelest of people."" @CAPS9 we were still twirling, all my other family members walked into the house. They smiled and laughed at us, but we didn't care. This was going to be a great @CAPS1, nothing could ruin it for us. When everyone got into the house we all sat down in the living room sharing stories of all the old and good times that we shared. We all knew that this was what my grandpa needed, and in his eyes we could all see that he was happy that he had a family, that could put away all of the hardships we were going through and allow ourselves to sit as a family and enjoy each other. Everyone was laughing now, remembering the stories that made our family what is was. My aunt @PERSON2 was the one that knew all of them by heart, she could even act them out. My grandpa sat there and laughed. He was filled with enjoyment as he watched his only daughter do what she did best.  When dinner was almost ready, my grandpa and I sat down at the dinner table all by ourselves. We began playing the game that we always played. I got underneath the table and hopped up in random seats acting like a cat. My grandpa would always say "" @CAPS11 down @PERSON1, that food isn't for @CAPS13."" then I would go and sit next to him and meow at his side, and we would just laugh. No one else understood the bond that my grandpa and I had. But that didn't matter, every holiday we were the ones that were always laughing; we enjoyed life and we never let anything @CAPS11 to us. He was the only one in my family that understood enjoyment and he helped me live my life that way.  Dinner was served and we all took our normal seats. My mother's food looked amazing like usual. My grandpa and I sat right across from each other like we always would and made the most unusual faces at each other. Our laughter filled the room and made that @CAPS1 even better. As we were all finishing our dinner, my grandpa got up and walked to the door looking outside at the beautiful landscape covered in a white blanket. I walked to his side and looked up at him. He smiled down at me and said ""@CAPS13 never realize the beautiful things in life, until your life is fading. The most beautiful thing to me is your laugh. It always brings joy to my heart. If I could only hear one more sound, it would be your laugh @PERSON1, and if I could only see one more thing it would be your smile. I'm happy to be your grandpa and I'm glad that I got to live and see @CAPS13 grow up to be such a beautiful and sweet girl. Always remember, enjoy ever moment. Especially the moments with the ones that @CAPS13 love."
381	21188	8	3	"Allot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship, and I whole - heartedly agree. Although not everyone always laughs, in every relationship, laughter is a crucial component that can turn someone's day into the greatest day they've ever had. There are always people having a tough time, whether it's at school, at home, or anywhere else. When you see someone in such a state, you should always try to cheer them up. You could say something nice, like ""Hope you have a good day @DATE3,"" and give them a warm smile. This simple act can make them put aside whatever is preventing them from laughing, and you'll have made their day just by sharing your smile and laughter.  Many people need someone to turn to when going through a very hard situation or problem. They can't handle it alone, whether at home or school. They need someone to talk to, share their feelings with, and have a shoulder to cry on. It always makes someone feel better to let out all that pain and their inner self. We all should make those going through a hard time smile and laugh, and this is always something very healthy in a relationship. It's a way to offer healing to the person in pain or sadness.  This reminds me of a true story because I was there. One time, there was a girl in my elementary school. She was an extremely happy girl who shared her laughter and happiness with others. She was someone anyone could approach when they had a problem or just needed someone to talk to. She was one of the nicest girls in school, and everyone liked her. She always showed love and respect to others. It always seemed as if her life was perfect, with no worries. She was an only child, so of course, her parents would always give her what she wanted, or at least that's what we all thought.  It had been a @DATE1, and it came to be @DATE2. We were all in school, except this girl. She never missed a day of school, so it was very strange for her not to be there. Naturally, we thought she must have been sick. But she missed another day, then another, and another. I started to think she had moved away and would probably never come back. However, the next week after that, she showed up. I was very happy to see her as I had missed that girl. But there was something very different about her. She wasn't the same. She wasn't laughing or smiling anymore. She had lost that sparkle that made her so special.  I thought to myself, ""What is wrong with her?"" I finally found out that she had been gone because her mom had passed away. I was so sad and didn't know what to say. She was so happy one day, and then suddenly, she didn't have her mom anymore. I thought, ""I have both of my parents, and she doesn't. I should share the happiness she had shared with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she's going through the hardest time of her life."" That's why being happy and sharing your happiness with others is always the greatest thing you can do for someone. You never know what kind of things they're going through, and they need someone to make them smile and laugh. In the end, spreading joy can bring light to the darkest of times."
382	21189	8	3	Building the @CAPS1 with Laughter  From a very early age, my uncle would bring the funniest cards to mine and my brother's birthdays, just to see our excited reactions. His cards were always so creative, with hilarious jokes that would have us laughing out loud for ages. Then, when my uncle moved to the west coast, near us, we would play little pranks on each other just to see each other's reactions. We've always been attuned to when the other is having a bad day and know exactly when to lift each other up.  When my family and I would go back to @CAPS3 at an early age, we would always celebrate each other's birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards for us. We would sit around the table, eagerly opening the cards and then sit there and laugh about them for hours on end. Then, when he moved to @LOCATION1, my older brother, @PERSON1, and I started to get him funny cards to see who had the best one. We got each other cards that ranged from sexual humor to gross humor. We would come to each other's birthdays with a big grin, @CAPS2 from one ear to the other, waiting for the person to open up the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card that had some older ladies on it and had some sexual humor towards it. Let's just say nobody has beaten that card to this day.  My uncle and I work in the same building but do very different jobs. He is the sales manager, and I assemble the items for him to sell. When I walk into work, I always pass by him to see how he is doing. For the most part, he is either laughing heartily or pissed off about something that happened during his day. On days that he is upset and walks outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION1, I start to make light - hearted fun of him right away. Sometimes he gets even more angry, but when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back at me with a witty, rude remark. This happens every day and always seems to brighten up our days.  We bought two season passes to @CAPS4.Hood this year. At first, I wasn't very good at skiing and would always fall. When I would fall, he would snowboard down to me while laughing uncontrollably, and I would get very upset. We would laugh on the way home, talking about how I would always fall. But as time went on, I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the run. One time, when we went up, he just couldn't seem to stay on his board and would fall non - stop. This was the time when I could finally get him back for all the times when he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I never laughed so hard in my life on that ride home. Coming down and making remarks at him about not being able to stay on his board was one of the most heart - warming things I have ever felt. It wasn't about making rude remarks; it was about sharing in the fun and seeing the humor in the situation. It has truly strengthened our bond, and I'm grateful for the laughter we share every day.
383	21190	8	3	"When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade, I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year, I felt as if I was old enough to ride the ""big kid"" rides, which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, and @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go through there because it was the fastest way into the park. There were two giant stain - glass - like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The doors were truly beautiful, with an outdoor scene painted on them. There were bears, fish, trees, rivers, and mountains.  We all walked into the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall, giving the lobby a grand and spacious feel. We walked all the way through the lobby and followed the signs until we got to the park entrance. There was a man - made mountain in the middle, shaped like a grizzly bear, and one of the rides was built around it. It was early in the morning, so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely.   We started out with the smaller rides and side attractions like ""It's Tough to Be a Bug"" @NUM1, shopping in the park, and parades. My mom was determined to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage, but unfortunately, we never made it back in time. It was about noon, and the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. The song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the background, adding to the festive atmosphere. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that surrounded that end of the park. On the opposite side of the pier was a man - made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food and popcorn, and it was making me @LOCATION3.  We continued walking until we got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2. There was a fifteen - minute wait time for the ride, which wasn't long. My older sister and I jumped in line and began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before, so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterflies in my stomach. I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.   Finally, we came to the front of the line. The man standing there working the ride asked, ""How many?"" My sister held up two fingers, and the man pointed at the ground next to him and said, ""Row eight."" The next set of cars came in, and they ushered us into the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner and stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that I had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a man's voice and some background music. The voice did a countdown from ten and then yelled, ""Blast off!"" and the ride took off at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a big smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill and plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists and turns, and the ride even went upside down! When it came time to take the picture at the end, I was crying I was laughing so hard. My sister and I exited the ride and walked over to the booth where they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then rode the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on, I was addicted to roller coasters, and I've ridden many since. The memories of that day at the park are still so vivid and full of fun."
384	21191	8	3	It was @DATE2 around @NUM1 degrees in west @LOCATION1. Me and a couple of friends were really bored and hot. All we really had to do was stay home and play video games. So I ended up coming up with the idea of going outside and maybe riding our bikes to the store, grabbing some ice cream and water, then riding up hamburger hill and possibly sitting under the shade. Everyone agreed to the plan. So all my friends left, we all took showers at our homes and met me up at the corner and then rode our bikes off to the store. We got all the items, and as we were making our way to the hill, a couple of the big kids who were in middle school came and jumped us all and stole all our food supplies.  Now, these guys have always been picking on us for some reason. Till this day, @CAPS1 still never understood why. Maybe it was because we didn't like what they did, or maybe they hate us cause my friend @PERSON3 stole one of the kids' girlfriends, but that's a different story. So after they got done pounding our faces into the dirt, they got on their bikes and rode off into the sunset like if they were proud of themselves for beating on @NUM2 - yr - olds. Our day was ruined. I had a black eye, @PERSON3 threw up, @PERSON2 was walking with a limp, and poor little @PERSON1 had a little scratch on his tiny little head.  After the brutal beating, the next day I called a group meeting in our tree house. To be for real, I was tired of them constantly beating on us, stealing our food, and giving us ultra wedgies. We needed to make a stand against our oppressors because for too long this has been going on. So I devised a plan, a perfect plan to make sure they never hurt us again. The plan went like this: @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 would talk to all of the kids that have been abused by them and get them to join our revolt. Then we would get all of the water balloons, eggs, and rotten food we could. One of the kids knew that they always left their houses and got on their bikes at @NUM3 pm. So at @NUM4 at night, me and @PERSON3 would flatten a couple of their tires. Each thing that came into my tiny little mind was just genius.  So after days of planning, hard labor, and complaining to our parents for money, the plan was finally set, and so we waited. Just like the kid said, they all came out at @NUM3. Once they noticed their tires had been slashed, a couple of the kids jumped out of the bushes and started hurling food at them. Then me and a couple of the kids were riding past them on our bikes and threw water balloons at them. They all split up. The ones whose bikes weren't slashed chased after us. They were going pretty fast and nearly caught up with us. When I gave the signal, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 pulled the rope, and the big kids flew off their bikes and face - planted like in the movies. It really seemed like the plan was going pretty well and it seemed like we were winning the war.  But as usual, some things are too good to be true. It seems that we forgot about the other big kids in the neighborhood, and when they saw this, all hell broke loose. Soon after their reinforcements came in, they overpowered us like a lion on a gazelle, beating each and every one
385	21192	8	3	Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed?That @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS1.       How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma owned a @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She was old and was in a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS1 and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION1.         @CAPS1's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.      So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS1 got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS1 with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing.         I don't know why but @CAPS1 just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS1 were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble.         I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS1 always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.                       
386	21193	8	3	For a year and two months I'd devoted my life to horses, school, and @CAPS1. We initially met in @CAPS2 grade and started off as friends, chatting during breaks and sharing school - related stories. Our friendship gradually escalated to a relationship in @LOCATION1 grade, holding hands and going to movies together. We ended up breaking up later on that year, but we continued to remain 'friends'. Obviously I still cared for @CAPS1, but I didn't believe he'd felt the same. But apparently I was wrong, we began a new relationship on @DATE1 at @NUM1 pm. It was the perfect start to our 'perfect relationship'. He and I were inseparable from the get - go, we literally did everything together, like having picnics in the park and studying at the library. I was @PERCENT1 irrevocably in love with @CAPS1. Between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and inside jokes. I could probably write a best - selling novel of all the memories we had, and I honestly believed that @CAPS1 and I were going to be together forever. I thought everything was going fine, till he had to lay it out, he liked someone else. At that point, I had no idea where our relationship (or I) stood. I didn't want to know. I couldn't keep putting my heart in the open if it was going to get stomped on, but I loved @CAPS1 and was willing to do anything to make it work. I stayed the night with @CAPS1, and we talked till @NUM2. He and I decided to attempt to make it work, but there was no guarantee it was going to. The next day, everything seemed fine. I was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but I was using all my power to make the best of what we had. We decided to take his dog, @CAPS3, on a walk. We held hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. Why? He was texting @CAPS4. By that time, I decided that was the final straw. It felt like I was getting in the way, so I felt that the only choice I had left was to leave @CAPS1. I walked in the door an hour later absolutely devastated. I cried till I felt I couldn't cry anymore, and then I would cry more. At the time, I truly felt that the world was ending right before me. My life was over. My days became long and depressing, and I felt that all I could do was give up. My heart shattered everytime I saw @CAPS1, and it made it even worse when people constantly asked about what had happened. I couldn't tell them, it wasn't a moment I would want to relive. I couldn't stop thinking about @CAPS1, and about all the memories we'd shared. That year and two months has been the greatest period of my life. Almost everytime I thought about @CAPS1 I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having @CAPS1, and thinking about @CAPS1 all the time made me into a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, and I would vomit because of the stress. But as I sat there alone thinking of the memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I needed to keep living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @CAPS1, he changed my life. He taught me so much about loving someone. I knew from that small laugh, that things were going to get better. A spark of hope, I would be happy again.
387	21194	8	3	The word (laughter) @MONTH1 means a smile or something nice that has happened to someone or even a thank you, but for many people it means the action or sound of laughing. For many people, the feeling they get inside when they laugh is the feeling of happiness. The sense of feeling good inside is the meaning that once in a while you have to be happy in life; have a balance in your life. For me, the word (laughter) means being happy and the feeling of doing something good in life. For instance, when a couple gets married, they need a sense of laughter in their lives so they can enjoy each other's company. It was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2 early in the morning. I was extremely excited to leave because that was the day I was going to go visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncles, and cousins that I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time. I was about to leave for two months and a half. I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time I felt happy and excited to go. That morning we arrived at the airport; I was about to ride on my very first airplane. As I tried to find my seat through the big line of people that were finding their seats as well; I sat down and buckled myself into the seat and looked out the window and all over the place. My stomach was turning in circles round and round and I had the feeling of a roller - coaster about to take off really fast. The next thing I knew the plane was moving. I got kind of scared, but at the same time I was excited. During the flight, I felt a sense of laughter in my soul; the memories of a childhood in @LOCATION2 were turning my emotions into laughter and tears that made me feel good like I had never felt before. The idea of seeing all my family and friends was captivating to my heart and emotions. As we arrived at the @LOCATION1 airport; my emotions were turning in circles back and forth. We only had two more flights left to get to our destinations. I was getting tired and sleepy, my legs and arms hurt so bad, they felt like if you were carrying two big bags of potatoes on each side of my legs and arms. We decided to go eat some place. As we walked around to see what we could find to eat, we found Pizza Hut. The next thing I knew was that we had only one hour until the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. As we arrived at the gate, people were already going in through the hallway to get into the plane so we hurried. Three hours passed by and we had landed in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 that was our destination. I felt a sense of laughter inside of me as we waited for our ride home; the feeling I got was as if someone had taken something from me and gave it back. I started to cry at that moment, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived that late afternoon to my grandparents' house. As I looked at them I felt happy inside, they were happy as well. We decided to spend the @TIME1 over at my grandparents' house. That @TIME1 nobody had gone to sleep, everyone was too busy talking with each other and catching up. The next day everyone was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside. We had spent a month and a half with family members that I had not seen in a while. We all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an incredible time catching up with family and friends. We did not get to do all the things we wanted to, but the best part was the time I had with my family and friends. The word laughter to me means the best thing that has happened to you and makes you feel good inside, or even the memories you think about when you are alone and sad. Those are the memories that will make you laugh and feel good about yourself. Other people @MONTH1 say that laughter is the feeling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best feeling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life, laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life.
388	21195	8	3	"There will always be moments in your life when your emotions will take control and motivate you, whether you're happy, sad, angry, or frustrated. At times like this, I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1, looked at me with her big blue eyes, which were swollen up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship, but we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, containing all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1's stuff in the moving van, I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him. It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along, @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shiny silver object lying on the ground. From where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engraving stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2's red and blue collar. I reached down and picked it up. I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someone's old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, ""@CAPS2!"" Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store. The guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us. ""That's my dog."" @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1. I was grateful to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also, I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far."
389	21198	8	3	On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house with great and loving parents. We had a nice big backyard, which my brother and I loved the most. @CAPS1 was downstairs making my brother and me school lunches for school. It was my brother's first day of school and he was so happy. I mean it's his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, that's awesome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and I went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue either. Yeah, my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I saw him through the window. He turned his head and smiled, I could see all the glue still wet and it was everywhere. My brother and I always had a good relationship, we both made each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probably wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very important part of any kind of relationship. It allows both people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sense of humor you have. As we approached the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waiting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people don't come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and I were so happy, we both knew grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up a little after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brother's face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on our birthdays. When my brother was at the table, @CAPS1 brought in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier. When the birthday cake was over and the presents, my brother and I went out to the backyard to play kick - ball. My brother wouldn't use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play. We both were having fun. We laughed every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back
390	21199	8	3	"Laughter, what is the meaning; to show mirth, joy, or scorn with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound. People without laughter in there life go through stages of depression or feel a sadness inside them; they never seem to be able to find the light at the end of the tunnel, ""the light being happiness."" The days @MONTH1 turn into to months or even years, life seems to be at a standstill.  When you feel there is no happiness you begin to have doubts on your decisions in life; the choices you have made in life seem to all be wrong. This is what my life felt like when the world turned around and I found out my best friend just flipped her car. I was traumatized, in shock; I didn't know so many things could rush through your head in that given moment. I instantly started to ask a million questions to see if she was okay. All they could share with me at the time was that she was being rushed to the hospital. All I could do once I got home was lay in my bed and think; what could I have done so she would not have been in that car-- all i felt was guilt! That night was wretched my mind just kept wrapping around all the times my best friend and I spent together, the laughter we shared between each other, stupid fights, and all the dumb pranks. What was eating at me most though was we had gotten in a fight not to long before she wrecked; the worst part was it was over the stupidest thing. I had got irritated at her for constantly ditching out on our plans we had together to go spend time with her boyfriend. Now that I look back at it, all I felt was jealousy. If only I could take it all back, then maybe she would not have been distracted while she was driving and missed her turn. That next morning her mother called me and said ""she is asking for you, you @MONTH1 come to the hospital and see her if you please."" I was ecstatic, I got ready faster than I ever have before; within a few minutes I was ready and in my pick-up driving myself to the @LOCATION1 hospital. It only took me thirty-five minutes to get there, when it should take you around forty -five. I instantly jumped out of my truck, rushed into the hospital and went to the check-in desk to see what room she would be in. They told me she was in room @NUM1 right down the hall on the left. I got to room @NUM1, there was a crack in the door so I peeked in before trying to open the door the rest of the way; I finally got the confidence to open the door and go talk to her. She instantly had a smile on her face when she saw me, I pulled up a chair and sat right next to her. We talked for about an hour just about random things; including the wreck. She told me she had a few broken rips and a minor concussion, so she should be able to be out by that afternoon. When she told me that, I was one of the happiest people right at that moment. All I could do was laugh when she told me everything was fine; almost like laughter of relief. It did not take long before both of us started laughing, most of it was out of excitement and having nothing else to say; except the beautiful sound of laughter coming out of our mouths. I have to say it felt good just to be by my friends side again being able to share happy moments with each other. So what is the meaning of Laughter to me; shall you ask? It is the most meaningful thing that anyone could possible do. Laughter is to show signs of happiness, a giggle or an outburst; sharing unforgettable moments with a loved one.Without laughter your life can not be complete, make jokes, just laugh make life have meaning again. Do not go through life being @PERSON2, instead be @PERSON1. Go ahead test it out and see what laughter can do for you in your life!"
391	21200	8	3	"It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1, feeling as nervous as a kitten in a new place, just like any kid would be in such a situation. I walked into the school and carefully checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria were about four tables, with around @NUM1 people sitting at each one. But it wasn't just the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention; it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 - @CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria, out in the open where all could see! I was completely baffled. I mean, I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit because everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling. And here I was, looking at at least @NUM2 high - schoolers just dueling away so casually. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all, judge them. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day with a determined thought in my head, ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting neatly in front of me, patiently waiting for someone to challenge its master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally, a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted the challenge and the game began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then kindly taught me how to play better, and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I can't hang around him without bursting into laughter. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high - school life would be like if they didn't attend @CAPS4 new school. It's amazing how a simple card - game duel in the cafeteria changed the course of my high - school experience."
392	21202	8	3	"JJ @NUM1                        Laughter  Some people might say laughter isn't important in any relationship, but I wholeheartedly think otherwise. Laughter can always lighten up the mood, no matter what kind of mood it is. The laughing might only last a few seconds, but that's perfectly alright as long as it's there. Maybe you would laugh because something's really funny or just because you're so tired that the exhaustion turns into amusement. My cousin and I laugh for both those reasons every single time we are together.  There are many stories I could tell you about laughing with my cousin. One of the best happened in @ORGANIZATION1! We had a pretty hilarious time in there. Like just the other day we went into @ORGANIZATION1 with one of our friends. Our friend went to go get some candy, and as soon as she left, me and my cousin took off running.  As we were running away and hiding, or as we like to call it ""being ninjas"", we couldn't stop laughing the whole time. She tried calling us, and searching for us, but we didn't answer or let her catch a glimpse of us. Then my cousin and I saw her walking in the other direction, so we quietly ran up behind her and gave her a good scare. That is one of the many times that laughing has been an important part of my life, and it just shows how laughter can make even the simplest moments so memorable."
393	21203	8	3	The Power and Benefits of Laughter is truly an important thing in life. Laughter has the magical ability to lighten one's mood and make you feel more happy. If people laugh more often, their days become happier, lighter, and seem much shorter. Little children are the ones who laugh more frequently. Making adults laugh is not very easy because they tend to be more serious. There are numerous stories that highlight laughter as the important element. Laughter can connect with many other wonderful elements, such as being glad or happy. I once read a story about a little girl named @CAPS3 who had a knack for making people glad. And through that gladness, people were encouraged to laugh more often. And through laughter, the sick people started to become healthier and got rid of their illnesses. Laughter consists of many different factors. For example, being glad leads to more laughter, being happy, and of course, more smiling. When you're feeling down and a stranger, for instance, smiles at you, you'll likely feel happier and your mood might lighten. The morning dawned to be gray and rainy. The people in the household woke up irritable and grumpy. Everything seemed to be going wrong. No one was smiling. The breakfast was a very dull one because no one felt like talking. It seemed that the day was going to end on a gloomy note.  @CAPS4 was also extremely grumpy that day. She absolutely didn't want to go to school at all. She was mad at everyone and everything. She was mad at the rain. Rain was her worst enemy because then she couldn't go out for a walk with her friends. She was mad at her maid because she had forgotten to fill her pitcher with warm water, as she always did. She was mad at her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. To tell the truth, she was mad at everyone, and she hadn't even considered that if she had been happier that day, then everything would seem okay. Well, anyway, she still had to go to school, whether she wanted to or not.  At school, the little teacher was as merry as usual. She wasn't a bit grumpy, even though it was a rainy and gloomy day. Some of the students had the same positive mood as the teacher, but there were very few of them. The schoolwork seemed never - ending to @CAPS4, especially her mathematics. But everything changed after the teacher told everyone that it was story time. The story was about a little orphan girl who had to go live with her mean relatives. But she wasn't affected by their moods at all. She was very simple - minded and always happy. Over a period of time, the people she was staying with (especially the sick and old) began to be happy, just like her. And when she had to leave that village, everyone was sad to see her go. With a light heart and a happy spirit, the girl left the most precious gift, the gift of being always happy which led to more laughter. Even when she was gone, a passing stranger might always hear happiness and laughter in that place. And it was even enjoyable to stay there for a little while before continuing your journey. Because the passers - by always felt themselves feeling much better in health, because of the laughter. After the teacher finished the story, @CAPS4 thought, why wouldn't she try to cheer her family up? Even though it was raining, it didn't mean that everyone should be gloomy. So after school was over, @CAPS4 quickly ran home to cheer everyone up. In the evening, when everyone was done with their day's tasks and relaxing, there was laughter heard through the windows. It seems like @CAPS4 has found a way to bring laughter into her household too. The story she heard earlier in the day has helped her today, and it will likely help her throughout her long life. She has remembered this special rule of home happiness. And always in her home, there will be happiness and laughter even on really gloomy and dark days. We can see that this small factor, which might not seem very significant to us, has made @CAPS4's life more happy. I sincerely hope that this little factor can help you too, to create a more joyful and happy life.
394	21204	8	3	"@CAPS4 has been a child of laughter throughout @CAPS4 whole life, always doing all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As @CAPS4 has grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't diminished. A few years back, when @CAPS4 fell through a metal roof, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained intact. The woman who gave @CAPS4 life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step - siblings, but it's a group of people we never see. When @CAPS4 thinks of @CAPS4 relatives, those step - siblings never cross @CAPS4 mind. In fact, @CAPS4 can't even remember what they look like. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem empty or lacking (considering that @CAPS4 father died when @CAPS4 was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sorry for @CAPS4. Sure, growing up in a low - income household, with a single mother and two young children was a tough situation to handle, but @CAPS4 managed to make it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike @CAPS4, her only source of support in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before @CAPS4 was even born. @PERSON1 has always been there for @CAPS4 and @CAPS4 mother. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when @CAPS4 was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was an unusual thing, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrived, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, @CAPS4 grew up in one house. Throughout the years that @CAPS4 lived there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had many occasions to come and stay with us. @CAPS4 used to share a room with @PERSON2, and they fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after @CAPS4 and three years after @PERSON2. He was always too small for @CAPS4 and @PERSON2 to play with, so having other girls in the house was really convenient. The both of them served as the family @CAPS4 never had... but it wasn't always smooth sailing. @PERSON2 and @CAPS4 had a lot of fierce fights in their time, but @CAPS4 never once thought that maybe their fights would cause them to leave. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and rather dull day, @CAPS4 awoke to find those important people in @CAPS4 life gone. They had left without a word. A year or so passed by, and @CAPS4 didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they vanished from the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was deeply hurt, but it gradually healed. One evening, the land - line phone in @CAPS4 house started ringing non - stop, and to @CAPS4 surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" It was as if nothing bad had ever happened between the two adults. When @CAPS4 and @CAPS4 family arrived to visit them in their new home, @PERSON2 took @CAPS4 to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. @CAPS4 didn't object because @CAPS4 wanted to be friends again... though if @CAPS4 had known what was going to happen, @CAPS4 wouldn't have gone. As they walked from the place and along the long mile road, the only sound that could be heard from their direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than @CAPS4 turned the corner and faced them. When he saw what a mess @CAPS4 was, he laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" @CAPS4 cried out. His expression quickly became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was buried so deeply in @CAPS4 hands that @CAPS4 couldn't speak, so @PERSON2 took over and said, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" Both of them were thinking it, but neither of them said a thing: ""jerk!"" He then turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but @CAPS4 turned him away. As @PERSON2 and @CAPS4 walked further down the stretch of cement, the pain from the wounds on @CAPS4 body became more bearable. ""@CAPS7,"" @CAPS4 said, glancing over at @PERSON2 with a small smile, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" @CAPS4 then cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin burst out laughing; @CAPS5 was fully amused by @CAPS4. @CAPS4 didn't quite understand it at the time, but something about the situation made @CAPS4 inner stomach tickle, and @CAPS4"
395	21205	8	3	"JJ @NUM1                        Laughter  @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 say laughter isn't important in any relationship, but I think other wise. Laughter can always lighten up the mood no matter what it is, the laughing @MONTH1 only last a few seconds but that's alright as long as it's there. Maybe you would laugh because somethings funny or just because your tired. My cousin and I laugh for both those reasons every time we are together.  There are many stories I could tell you about laughing with my cousin. @CAPS1 of the best happened in @ORGANIZATION1! We have @CAPS1 pretty funny time in there. Like just the other day we went into @ORGANIZATION1 with one of our friends. Our friend went to go get @CAPS1 candy, and as she left me and my cousin ran way.  As we were running away and hiding or as we call it ""being ninjas"" we couldn't stop laughing the hole time. She tried calling us , and finding us, but we didn't answer or let her see us. Then my cousin and I saw her walking the other direction, so we ran up behind her and scared her. That is one of the many times that laughing was a part in my life."
396	21206	8	3	"One day I woke up, gazing out my window and listening to the melodious chirping of the birds outside. I usually leave my window open while sleeping to let in the fresh air because I really hate breathing in my own warm breath. Anyway, as I woke up, I walked out and had some rice crispy treats with my two sisters, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. As I was about to finish, I suddenly realized I was late for school. I was only in @NUM1 grade, so I quickly ran to get dressed and told my sisters to hurry up and get ready. But you know how girls can be, spending time putting on their makeup and doing their hair. My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade. Our schools were right next to each other. Finally, they got ready and we were on our way, heading off to school, excited for an awesome day with my teacher, @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world, but I only liked her because when we were cleaning our desks, she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book. The book was by ""@CAPS1 foul"". I can't recall the name, but I remember the cover was gold and it was about ghouls and monsters. The way she read it made it seem like we were right there in the story. That book was so intense, even though I really didn't understand it. Next, she would give us a math worksheet. I know, math in @NUM1 grade! But I was really smart at math and she would always pick on me and give me harder math than others. When I asked her why I was getting harder math than the other kids, she told me I was different. I knew I was smarter than some kids, but not all, so I never knew if that was a compliment or an insult. But I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way, we can get to the fun part where all the laughter is. School is over, and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home. After @NUM5 min of looking for her, I find her walking to the crosswalk. I yell her name, ""@CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running towards her and her friends. As you know, she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother, so she ran across the street. My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me. I was in a rush to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross - guard lady to signal to me. At last, she finally noticed me. I was walking in a hurry past to get to the car because I had heard my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"". So I was walking faster and faster. As I was walking, I heard from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed was that it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner, nearly hitting the cross - guard lady. The car hit the crossing stick and out of nowhere, I was hit, flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised, with cuts everywhere. My dad was panicking, running out of the car, screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information, like the license plate number. As I was lying on the ground, my dad came to me and was trying to get me up. He pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember, I had my scooby - doo underwear on and everyone was staring at me. I was more embarrassed than hurt. I didn't feel the pain until the next day, so I was all right. I couldn't walk, so my dad ran and put me in the car. Everyone was laughing at me because they saw my underwear. My dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. They told my dad that I would be able to walk again, but would have trouble doing sports because I had a fractured hip. I was living the dream. My sisters were spoiling me, giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream. And on top of that, I couldn't feel the pain. But the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did. My mean old teacher saw me limping and what she told me got me mad. She had told me to ""stop faking it"". I had told my mom that and she got so mad. You would not want to be that teacher. So, let's say it wasn't pretty. The lady who hit me pays for my doctor bills."
397	21207	8	3	"My knees were weak and my hands were slightly shaking as my rapid heartbeat was causing my breathing to increase in speed and rhythm. I desperately wanted to get this over with, but at the same time, I hadn't the slightest intention to ever start a conversation, let alone, approach him. It had been a whole @DATE1 since I had seen my dad and I wasn't sure whether to expect a relaxed, laid - back man, or an uptight, cranky one. So, I closed my eyes tightly, took several deep breaths, and decided to put this in the hands of fate. It was obvious that once I saw my dad, it would be a natural thing to talk to him, but I was suspicious of his mood and if it would affect mine at all! If for any reason this did happen for the worse, we probably wouldn't be on good terms for a matter of weeks. He'd then continue to pull the, ""@CAPS2 think now that @CAPS2're a teenager, @CAPS2 can do and act however @CAPS2 want?"" Or the, ""I'm your father, I deserve more respect!"" Lines. The funny thing is, I never start any of these things. He chooses to start them when he's bored, I guess. Then, he continues to make me feel bad for his wrongdoings. When my mother, sister and I arrived at the airport, (I'm not going to lie) I felt a strong urge to go home. My sister would crack a few jokes here and there and my mother would let her wittiness shine on me. Even in the midst of all of this, they could only get a small giggle out of me because I let my nerves get the best of me. I didn't want my past three months of @DATE1 to be ruined by his coming home. But once I looked back at all I had done: two weeks in @LOCATION1, rafting, etc., I realized that I did miss him and did want him back. Don't get me wrong, my dad is a super - nice, funny, and hard - working guy, it's just hard to get along with him sometimes. My dad's flight had landed, and after a solid hour of waiting for him, he came out of the airplane. We could see his eyes frantically scouring the airport for us, and when he found us, he gave the warmest, friendliest smile I had ever seen upon his face. Tears welled up in his eyes as my sister raced towards him and my mom quickly walked behind. My legs carried me toward him and I soon found that my sister and I were competing to be the first to hug him! One hundred feet never felt so close yet so far away. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts, now that we were with him. The good thing is, an awkward moment never occurred. It knocked, but we didn't let it come through the door; instead, laughter came in its place. All of my troubles and worries were gone when he opened his mouth, and those soothing waves of laughter came out and were welcomed into our ears. My heart was lifted and my smile brightened. I knew that my father could not have been gone any longer. I love him! Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation. It is kind and has no regrets. The only mistake is not taking the chance to laugh in the first place. Laughter is one of the many things that holds me so close to my father today. Our sense of humor when we're together is never dull and is unforgettable. I trust him with my life and ever since I was born, he has found a way to make the best out of every situation by laughter. You can count on his laugh to make anyone smile and it is without a doubt, the most contagious thing you'll ever hear."
398	21208	8	3	"The first day I met her, I knew she was the right dog for me. Her black and white fur was as soft as the finest cotton, and her eyes as brown as the rich bark on an old tree. She had a genuine personality that no other dog could possess. Which was something I could tell right away she was the dog for me. Over the next couple of months, our friendship grew steadily, as I patiently taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab named @PERSON1 instantly became her best friend. The two would run over the property, barking merrily and playing with boundless energy. Every night the two would cuddle up next to each other and sleep soundly. The times when she, my new dog, would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo. Her middle belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a large - breathing oreo cookie. That's where her name had come from. The seventh month had come along fast, but it was enjoyable every single day with my dog at my side. She gave me the best comfort when I needed it most, always giving me a warm smile when the day was rainy, or sleeping next to me when I didn't feel the best. It was kind of like she was my own special dose of medicine, her presence made me feel well again. Her love had grown deep into all of our hearts at that house and she was one of a kind. But something began to change about her as the days went on. Her food bowl would be nearly full every time we fed her. She wouldn't run with @PERSON1 anymore. She wouldn't talk, and she wouldn't smile. I knew something was wrong. We didn't know she was sick until it was too late. The first day she had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but none of us had the money to do it. The second day in the morning, I couldn't find her anywhere on the property. I thought that maybe she had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. Panic spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1,"" I looked at her straight into her eyes, ""I know you can hear me."" She looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. ""Where is she, @PERSON1?"" I knew she understood me as she began to sniff around the areas of the property. Suddenly, as if she had picked up a trace, she followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON1 wagged her tail, looked at me and then looked back under the car. There she was, looking sick. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriend's mother to look at her. We weren't sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called an animal expert and asked. The expert said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadn't gotten her her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up, carefully shooting water into her dehydrated body, and giving her spinach juice, hoping it would help. But all she wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the morning. In the morning, my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with her to take care of her. I sang soft songs to her as she lay on the porch, looking sad and in despair. I stroked her on her head, telling her how much she was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat but she would only puke it back up. Finally, after a day of crying next to her, I noticed she kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the incentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, I noticed a large bloody hole from which flies were flying out. She was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not. I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her, watching her be in pain. It was time. As soon as we got to the vet office, they took her inside and laid her on a table. I was told to hold onto her as they shot an overdose of anesthesia into her. It was only seconds before she was gone and everyone in the room was silent. I cried over her limp, no - longer - smiling body. We dug a hole and buried her under the tree where she used to play. ""Goodbye, my mama bear. I hope you're happy in heaven."
399	21209	8	3	Fishing trip gone wrong. Let me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of my life ever since I was born. When I was little, I used to go out with my dad and brother to go fishing. My dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. I've fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old, I got a brand - new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. It was so shiny and had a great ball - bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right, it would shoot beams of
400	21210	8	3	@DATE1 my birthday, my boyfriend @PERSON2 took me to @LOCATION1 to @ORGANIZATION2's. I had never been there it was exciting and a new food experience for me. My dad had promised me that he would take me because it was my @NUM1 birthday and he wasn't there for my @NUM2 birthday. But he forgot so my dads girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager that it was my birthday and to give me anything that i wanted and just to charge it on her credit card. This is where mine and @PERSON2's adventure started..  The beging of our adventure. Driving on the old back roads of @CAPS1 in the old @ORGANIZATION1 on our way to @LOCATION1. Just @PERSON2 and I, the roads were damp with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves of all different color's of red's, green's, and orange. Bouncing around from the dips in the old road. @NUM3 bumpin on the stereo, only singing the parts we know. When we got to @CAPS2 we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in @LOCATION2 the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a way bigger city than @PERSON1 or @CAPS1 wasn't good, We had no clue where we were.  First place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store. we go inside and theirs @CAPS4 decorations as far as the eye could see. Monster's, whitche's, and goblin's. We got side tracked by all the scary things I realized that I had to go to the bathroom. While I went to the bathroom @PERSON2 asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @CAPS5. The guy tells us hes never heard of a place like that. So we got back into the @ORGANIZATION1, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yeah its just down a couple of streets. As we drive down the highway we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we are lost all over again so we find another covenant store up this really big hill. we didn't think that the little @ORGANIZATION1 could make it up such a big hill. We made it to the top, went inside and had the clerk look up on his phone were we needed to go. As we waited all I could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes. We got the address and took off again for our search.   About twenty minutes later we still had no luck at finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We find another covenant store and @PERSON2 ran in to ask. The clerk told us to get back on the highway I was like no no stay on this road. We followed the empty road and right around the corner there it was @CAPS5. We were happy to have found it finally and we weren't even late. All @PERSON2 and I could do was laugh because we had gotten so frustrated to find the stupid place that it was just so funny you couldn't help but not to laugh. It brought @PERSON2 and I just that much closer we had gotten through that by laughing instead of fighting. And that we our funny adventure story. 
401	21211	8	3	Ever since I was born, laughter has been a significant and constant part of my life. Without it, I would be a very boring and perpetually grumpy person. Even though I have experienced numerous moments filled with laughter, one specific moment always comes to mind. About a year ago, my mom and I went on a trip down to @LOCATION1 to visit her family. It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mom and I could not go visit them due to immigration problems. After all those years had passed by, my mom and I managed to obtain our legal residency in the United States. As soon as we got the residency, we were free and could go visit her family without having to return illegally. When my mom and I arrived at the airport in @LOCATION1, my mom started crying because she was overwhelmed with emotions. For the first time in twelve years, she was going to see her mom, dad, brothers, and sisters. As soon as we had gone through all the airport security and baggage claim, we made our way out to the exit where my grandpa had agreed to pick us up. When we got outside the airport, a small little red @ORGANIZATION1 started getting closer and closer, driving steadily towards my mom and me. The car was no further than forty feet away when my mom suddenly dropped her luggage and started running eagerly toward the small red car. I had no idea who the elderly person driving the car was. When the car parked, an aged man stepped out of the vehicle and gave my mom one of the longest and most emotional hugs I had ever witnessed in my entire life. They must have been hugging for at least fifteen minutes, just crying on each other's shoulders. When they had finished hugging, my mom called out my name and I started walking toward her. When I was face to face with my mom and the older man, my mom told me that the man was my grandfather. Then she looked at her dad and told him to meet his grandson. For the first time in a very long time, I had a grandfather. I stood in shock for a while, and so did he. He was amazed at how big I had grown and how much I had changed in those long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me. When I reached out to hug him, he gripped me tightly and didn't let go. He told me that this day had been the happiest day of his life. Me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family. When we got done loading everything into the car, we headed home. The long ride home was a bit strange and uncomfortable because there wasn't much conversation in the car. It was about a fifty - minute ride home when we reached our destination in a small little town outside of @LOCATION1 called texcoco. It was a nice little clean town with a lot of small stores and lots of two - story middle - class houses. The streets were full of cars and people walking or on bicycles, very different from what I was used to back in the United States. When we got to our house, there was a group of about twenty people that were family and friends outside the gate waiting for us. When we were done settling in and got done meeting all our relatives, we got together and had a family dinner. One of my uncles really stood out because he was really funny and always acted like a clown. He was the one that set the mood in the house or wherever he went. As days passed by, I was getting more and more comfortable with the people around me and started having fun. About two weeks passed and my uncle @CAPS1 invited me to one of his stand - up comedy shows. That day, I experienced more laughter than ever before. His jokes were original and true. In conclusion, laughter is one of the essential elements of life. Without it, I could not be happy.
402	21213	8	3	"It's my sophomore year, and some of my friends were going to try out for softball. After giving it some thought, I decided to join, and I immediately fell in love with this sport. I'm not extremely skilled, but as they say, practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a great time together. Everyone gets along well, and it's really enjoyable to be part of a team that is always laughing and having a wonderful time as a group. This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard that we almost started crying, and now it's one of our little inside jokes among all of us girls. Once, my friends and I were out catching pop - flys, and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went out there skipping and just being my normal, quirky self. They hit the ball, and it started to come toward me. I went running for it, but I slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone, including me, started laughing because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later, we were all standing there, chatting about how funny it was when I fell and how it had made everyone's day. Then I saw some mud on the ground, and I had the urge to roll in it, but I didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in the mud. So I asked my friend @PERSON1 to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud, I got up and started laughing uncontrollably. My knees were covered in mud, and so were my butt and legs. They all started to say ""who shied on you"" because we aren't allowed to curse, so we made up something else to replace it. Now, when I walk in the hallways and see someone from the softball team, we both just start laughing and say ""who shied on you"" in the middle of whatever we are doing at that moment. This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school, and I'm really glad I did it because I'm having so much fun. When the season ends in a few months, I'm going to be really sad. All these girls and I have become so close in the last @NUM1 weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us used to just know each other in passing and weren't really friends and never talked at all, but now we are all very close. We love to do silly things like randomly sing in the locker room or tell the most ridiculous jokes ever. But we all have a great time, and we don't care. We have had lots of laughs, and there are many more to come this season. Like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice. We have an amazing coach who makes us laugh and tells jokes every day. This season should be really interesting with all of us because we all like to laugh, make jokes, sing, and just have a great time with each other, and that's all that matters to make a good softball team and a great season."
403	21214	8	3	The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major and integral part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are excellent because I can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs, it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that pure joy and happiness. When you laugh, the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh; nothing else can intrude. Laughter, in many cases, has the remarkable ability to bring people from an absolute low self - esteem to a high self - esteem in a very short amount of time. An example of where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong, it kind of left us guessing. What could have happened? After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people who were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing, which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places and was over - drinking. By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things rather than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a great way of coping with your problems. Even when it seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will; you just have to be patient and give it time. The moral of the story that I have just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always help ease the pain. Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better. Laughter truly is a powerful and positive force in our lives.
404	21215	8	3	Laughter is a huge and vital part of everyone's life. It's used to express several different emotions, from pure joy to light - hearted amusement. It's also used to bridge the gap between people and break the awkward barrier that sometimes exists in social situations. People laugh at their own mistakes, which shows others that they too are fallible. Some people can communicate through laughter and understand what the other is feeling without saying a word. For instance, one time while I was on a long car ride and very bored and about to fall asleep, out of nowhere, I began laughing with my friend. We laughed in different ways and carried on a whole conversation just with laughter. Laughing can bring others together by sharing common interests; after all, everyone laughs. I laugh more than others, I'm sure of it. Laughter is a huge part of my life. Honestly, without it, my life would be dull and depressing. I laugh so much sometimes that my side and stomach hurt really badly. I also make a lot of mistakes and am very clumsy, so I get laughed at a lot. My family is a very close - knit and hilarious family. We make a lot of mistakes constantly every day. For my great grandma's @DATE1, we were planning a surprise party. While we were planning it, my grandma kept getting suspicious and asking what we were doing. So we kept telling her that we were going to get her a stripper for her @DATE1. So we managed to persuade my uncle Bobby into being a stripper and climbing out of a box, and he did it. It ended up scaring my grandma. Until this day, we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time. Every day, my aunt acts in a ridiculous and funny way, so most of the time, I laugh at her. She is always dancing to the music on commercials or singing opera in a comical way. My great grandma always eats foods that make her pass gas, and it's hilarious because sometimes she doesn't even realize that she is doing it. My great grandma also likes to dance, and it's also really funny because the dance moves that she knows are far different from the ones today. I believe that without laughter, my family would not be as close as we are. Without laughter, I would not be as close to my friends. You can bond over laughter; it sometimes forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways you wouldn't have. It makes you comfortable around people and able to share things, act silly, and not worry about your appearance. Laughter can also change your emotion from mad to happy in an instant. For example, I was riding dirt bikes with my younger cousin, and he decided that he wanted to go through this swamp with his bike. I told him it wasn't very wise because I knew it was not possible for him to go through there without getting stuck, yet he tried it anyway. So, as I assumed, he got the bike stuck. Since I was the only one with him, I had to help him get the bike unstuck. It took a long time for us to get the bike out. As soon as we did, he tried to drive through again and got it stuck yet another time. I was very upset with my cousin, but as I was getting ready to yell and leave him, he fell in the mud head - first, and it instantly changed my mood. Even still today, I laugh about the matter even though I didn't think it was very funny at the time. Even though laughter is good, it can also be bad. For example, laughing at others while they are hurt and crying, or laughing at stupid, ignorant pranks, or even laughing at people while they are making bad decisions. Decisions like drinking; drunk people can seem funny, but the fact of being drunk or drinking at all is not always a good thing. You can actually influence people to make bad decisions by laughing at them. Laughing at them makes them think that it's okay to do what they are doing because it is making others laugh. So laughter is healthy, but it also has its negative aspects.
405	21217	8	3	So my friends and I got into a heated discussion about how we need to keep things to ourselves because one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us a lot of problems in school and around town. For example, he started to lie to us. One of my other friends lost his temper and went after him, tackling him down and telling him to stop lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in our seats, he started to spill his guts to us. He told us some rumors he started about us and some other things he did. We all kind of lost it. So we calmed down a little and then took turns talking to him. After my two friends talked, it was my turn. I was talking to him, and he kept interrupting me. Finally, I got mad and I grabbed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't get me wrong; I didn't want to hurt him. I just wanted to stop him from interrupting me. I reached down, grabbed something soft without looking, picked it up, and threatened to throw it at him. He started to
406	21218	8	3	"Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with intense anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do so. Then she glanced at me. Just for a fleeting second, but it was enough to gather some information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was intently focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feel her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. No girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, ""I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you."" All I could do was focus on not looking like a complete moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know I saw her smile, and it was at me! There was [PERSON1], smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then [DATE1] came. The ice rink in [LOCATION1] was about [NUM1] minutes away, which seemed short because of the [NUM2] friends that were howling and talking nonsense about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice. Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slid on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One - by - one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about [CAPS1] of [CAPS2]: [CAPS3] [CAPS4] and the various other games that held our interest. But as usual that conversation turned into a heated debate about ""over - powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a [DATE2]'s breeze. Then as she looped around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before. She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""[CAPS5] the sniper is [CAPS6] [LOCATION2], you don't know what you're talking about!"" my friends sneered at one another. I had no interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards [PERSON2]. As I approached her I was running one - liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her. I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along."
407	21219	8	3	"Laughter I have many wonderful friends. My friends and I are always up to silly antics to have a great time and simply pass the hours away. We are constantly laughing. There isn't a single day when we're together that we don't burst into laughter. My friends and I whole - heartedly believe that laughter is an essential element of life. One, scorching, [DATE1] day my friends, [PERSON2], [LOCATION3], [PERSON1], [LOCATION1], and [PERSON3], all came over to my house. We were all bored out of our minds and sweltering hot, so we were eager to decide on something exciting to do. [LOCATION3] said, ""[CAPS1] don't we go swimming you guys?"" We all readily agreed. However, my friends and I couldn't come to an agreement on where to go swimming. We couldn't go to the pool near my house, because it was extremely crowded. We also couldn't go to the lake, because it was too far away, and we had no means of getting there. My mother was at work, so she couldn't give us a ride. [CAPS6] then said, ""I know you guys! [CAPS1] don't we just have a water balloon fight right here at [CAPS2]'s house?"" We all responded, ""[CAPS3] let's do it!"" A short while later, the [CAPS4] went to the nearest store, which was [ORGANIZATION1], to buy water balloons and water guns. Once they got back, they started filling them up right away. Meanwhile, us ladies changed into our bathing suits. After that, we all decided on who was going to be on what team. The first team was [PERSON2], [PERSON3], and [LOCATION1]. The second team, and the best team in our opinion, was [LOCATION3], [PERSON1], and I. Both teams were raring to go. Each team had buckets brimming with water balloons and water guns. The teams were positioned on different sides of my mom's green suburban. We were going to start throwing water balloons at the count of three, but the opposite team cheated and threw a water balloon before. Oh, but they didn't realize that we had the hose on our side. [PERSON4] chased [PERSON1] across the yard. She caught up to her and soaked her with her water gun, but [PERSON1] threw a huge water balloon at her. It exploded right on her face. We all started laughing uncontrollably. Then, [PERSON2] and I started throwing water balloons at each other. We ran out, so we started using our water guns. Those too eventually ran out of water. [PERSON2] was all out of resources. I grabbed the hose, and I turned it up to full power. [PERSON2] tried to run but he slipped and fell. I completely hosed him down. My team had won the first [CAPS5]. It was time for [CAPS5] two now. We had filled up more water balloons, refilled our water guns, and gone to our sides. We all counted, ""One! Two! Three!"" [CAPS5] two had started. [LOCATION3] started chasing [PERSON3]. They went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her. He caught up to her on the grass. The grass was really slippery from when I got [CAPS6] wet, so they slipped, and fell down. [PERSON3] slipped first, but she took [LOCATION3] down with her when she was trying to get back up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which made it harder for them to get up. [PERSON3] managed to get up and she went on the side where her team was. They started throwing everything they had at us. They soaked us up. We had lost the second [CAPS5]. Now it was time for the final [CAPS5]. The [CAPS5] that would decide who won, and who lost. We filled up double the water balloons, and double the water guns. No one got the hose that time. We thought it was not fair. Both teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right side, and the opposite team was on the left side. We were against whoever was lined up in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at [LOCATION1]. Then [LOCATION3] threw at [PERSON2], and after [PERSON3] at [LOCATION2]. Whoever moved out of line lost. [PERSON1] was the first to lose. [PERSON3] had thrown a big water balloon at her that knocked her out of line. We moved a step closer. It was now three against two. [LOCATION3] then water - gunned [CAPS6] down. We walked another step closer. [PERSON4] and I were going back and forth at each other, but [PERSON4] had no more water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty so I beat her. We moved another step closer. [LOCATION3], and I easily soaked [PERSON3] down. My team had won! We all cheered, then went back inside to dry off, and have some ice cream to celebrate my team's success. That day we proved that anyone can have a great time with some good friends, a bit of imagination, and a lot of laughter. I firmly believe that everyone should laugh on a regular basis. There is no need for sadness or anger in life."
408	21220	8	3	"Well it all started with the day he came to the airport. I was missing him so much, hardly ever getting to see him or have him return my phone calls like a [CAPS2] brother should. But it is always a blessing to see him and have him over for the holidays. It's amazing how he found time during the [DATE1] to come and visit us. It was well fortunate because now I didn't have to hear him complain all the time about how it's too cold and wet out there. So it was pretty good but because it was the [DATE1], it was normally about the time I go out and hang out with my friends and girls. And now I started talking to this really beautiful girl that lives right around the corner from my house. I was dying to go out and be with her but since time was really short with him I had to put my [CAPS2] brother first before anything. But then again every chance I got, I left and sneaked away to go see her. She was so beautiful, so funny. Man, she was so perfect to me it was crazy like a dream. I would tell my brother all the time about her. He would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that. It was the first day he spent the night. Everybody was so happy in the house from the time we picked him up from the airport to the drive home, talking and making jokes about how much he changed and how tight his clothes are. It was great. We even stopped at Burger - Vile to get a couple burgers cause he was such a fat boy, always so hungry, non - stop eating. We shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sister's face was priceless. Their mouths were open so wide like if they just saw a miracle. As they came running towards him, he wasn't so prepared for it. Slowly still putting his bags down by the door, he gets tackled and overrun by a [NUM1] year old girl and a [NUM2] year old boy. It was hilarious seeing them so happy and excited. It was a surprise for them; we were only supposed to get gas ha ha ha. Then after we sat down and talked all night. We had rented movies earlier that day to watch as a family, but like my family, nothing ever happens according to plan or on time. You know when you're having fun and laughing you don't want it to end and you forget about everything, let time go by and keep on doing what you do. But as time catches up to you and you're running on low energy because you've been excited all day to see your [CAPS2] brother and to share stories, tell jokes and laugh, having a great time, you get sleepy and in real need of some rest, like sleeping in your bed, under the covers and with the lights off, in silence. Oh, good times having pleasant dreams of food and girls. Most of the time they're put together in one whole dream after dream ha ha ha. Then we woke up and had a great time, sharing some laughs in the morning, cracking jokes non - stop. Talking and hanging out, I got to take my [CAPS2] brother to some of my parties which really scared my parents but it was funny at the same time. Because before we left my mom was like, ""Okay, we're letting you go out. Don't get yourself into any trouble [CAPS1] don't alright. Your dad's going to be picking you up so don't be acting stupid. Look after your"
409	21221	8	3	My Laughter Story @CAPS1 you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @PERSON4 were just hanging out up at @ORGANIZATION4's house one day and @PERSON4 was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what @PERSON4 was saying, then suddenly @PERSON2 calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to @LOCATION1, but she said only @NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and @PERSON4 was the one having to stay back, but @PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and I were mobbing the bus to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to get some @ORGANIZATION2. When we got to @ORGANIZATION2 we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION3's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at @NUM2 a.m because we had to ride the bus back to @LOCATION2 early because it was @DATE1 and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in @LOCATION2 we called up @PERSON4 to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home. It was a good weekend.
410	21222	8	3	laughter is the best medicine,well that is what some people say. I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. @CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend/girlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with him/her. @CAPS1 don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things @CAPS1 sonorously we would not have @CAPS1 many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have @CAPS1 many people in jail or person,   @CAPS1 that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship. But you think what you want but this is what i think is good about laughing.
411	21223	8	3	"Have you ever laughed so hard that you started crying? Were you alone? Most of the time when you are laughing about something you are with someone else. I believe that laughter brings two people closer because it's something you guys both share, a moment you and that other person can think of and picture over and over again in the future. Even if that person is miles away. I can remember it as if it just happened a couple weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @CAPS3 mom. I went into @CAPS3 room and unplugged @CAPS3 little black phone from the charger. I carefully opened it and a blinking light flickered, clearly saying ""@NUM1 missed calls from @PERSON1."" I quickly called her back to sincerely apologize for missing her phone call. I heard someone pick up, but nobody talked on the other end. "" @CAPS1, @PERSON1 you there?"" I had asked, anxiously hoping I would get a reply out of her. I sure got a reply just not the one I was wanting. She started bawling. Trying hard to catch her breathe, the words barely escaping her mouth. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS3 grandpa just died.""  @CAPS3 heart sank deep into @CAPS3 stomach. @CAPS3 eyes started to water up and @CAPS3 throat started to close, making it even harder to breathe. @CAPS3 voice was all shaky and rough. I said, ""I'm sorry @PERSON1."" and I started crying. Us both crying wasn't going to make anything better anytime soon. She then had explained that he had a heart attack and asked me how something could happen to someone that didn't deserve it. I didn't have an answer to give her though. I had never been in the position she was in. Who was I to know what to say, or do to help her? So I thought hard of what to say to her that would clear her mind a little bit. @CAPS3 brain started hurting when I finally found something from the heart to tell her, something I would want to hear if @CAPS3 grandpa passed away.  I said in a low calming voice, ""there isn't much I can tell you because I don't know from experience, but you're family needs you right now as much as you need them. Think about the good times you had with you're grandpa @CAPS4. The laughs you guys enjoyed together. I heard a slight giggle underneath her sniffling. She started telling me a story about how every year her family would take a weekend beach trip. How it was a wonderful time for her family to bond and how she would miss it. When she told me that story @CAPS3 heart warmed and the corners of @CAPS3 mouth went up a little. I was proud of myself for sticking in there and being strong for @CAPS3 friend. Even though @PERSON1 will never see her grandpa @CAPS4 again she will always have him with her. Through memories, within her heart, and by laughter. Laughter truly has the power to heal and bring comfort in difficult times."
412	21224	8	3	"Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't easily stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She calmly tells me to go to the cabinets and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the cabinets. I politely asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no labels on them. ""I think it's the jar on the left"", she said. I quickly grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we carefully took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Immediately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in their mouths. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the cabinets. She carefully sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of nowhere everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happened with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter are real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop immediately and take the time to have a laugh. Laughter can turn an ordinary evening into an unforgettable one."
413	21225	8	3	"Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or an inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 usually occurs from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I definitely wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could have done better--that's for sure. My self - confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negative thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log - in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps. Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was an element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to be more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was from the many taps from the kids' keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite well--unlike me.  Minutes had flown by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as well. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moment."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as well.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as well. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared. Laughter can turn a stressful situation into a light - hearted one."
414	21227	8	3	"For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. It's possible that people don't think @CAPS2's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, but boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that it is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!"" It is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. ""@CAPS2's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2,"" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so"
415	21229	8	3	"As warm @DATE1 days turned into chilly winter nights, the girls (@PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON2, @CAPS1 and @PERSON4) and I were wondering what we should do to add a little pizazz to our life's. No one knew what was to come or the laughter we would experience. It was one of the biggest games in the @ORGANIZATION1 season. It was to determine whether or not they would go to the playoffs to compete for the @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is the biggest @ORGANIZATION1 fan known to man. She was of coarse, all decked out in @CAPS3 attire. We watched the game, had a few shots of apple juice and pigged out on @ORGANIZATION2.   Halftime was coming right around the corner and to say the least, the halftime show wasn't going to be all that and a bag of chips. I pulled my camera from my @PERSON1 look alike bag and pressed record. While I was walking around in a circle trying to get everyone in the video, @PERSON3 was having a little too much fun on a red exercise ball. She was bouncing up and down at least @NUM1 or three inches into the @CAPS7. A light bulb went off in my head. I handed the camera to @PERSON4 and slowly moved over to where @PERSON3 was bouncing. Just as @PERSON3 screamed, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7!"" I kicked the exercise ball out from under her and when she came back down she was straight on her back!  @PERSON3 was too busy laughing and trying to breath to tell @CAPS5 how stupid I was. I was on the floor curled into a ball trying really hard not to pee my pants when all of sudden I hear this bang sound. I look up and the camera was lying on the floor next to @PERSON4, @PERSON5, and @PERSON2 who were laughing along with @CAPS5. @PERSON3 finally got the strength to get up. She came over and smacked @CAPS5 across the head and said, ""@CAPS8't ever do that again."" I'd say we had a better halftime show then the @ORGANIZATION1 did.  As the game ended, the weather changed and it began to snow. While everyone scurried to find their shoes, knocking into one another, I grabbed the camera not worrying if I got sick or not. We spent the last hour doing two of my favorite things; taking pictures and making memories. We went back inside and slowly went into slumber after drinking a little too much hot chocolate and apple juice. @PERSON3 has always been an early bird. I felt this sharp pain in my back and I shot straight up. Only to quickly realize that it was only her fist. Soon after everyone else arose from their warm blankets. Everyone @CAPS9 @CAPS1. We let her sleep and wondered outside again. It snowed. A @CAPS11. We thought of a plan and began to gather all the snow into one giant pile. @CAPS1 is a heavy sleeper so we picked her up, open the door that led to the backyard and plopped her right down in the center of the pile.  @CAPS1's eyes opened big and wide. Her mouth followed doing the same thing. She used every bad word she could possibly think of, including some in @CAPS12 that even she didn't know the meaning of. Soon, we were all in the snow laughing so hard we couldn't even @CAPS6 our breaths to apologize. @CAPS1 came to realize that it was an exceptionally good joke and began laughing along with the rest of us. In the end, we all had a good laugh and a cold to share that night. Laughter is the most important element in any relationship. It makes the bond between you and others stronger. Whoever said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" was @PERCENT1 right."
416	21230	8	3	FUN @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I've had the same best @CAPS2 for about three years now. There are a lot of times where hearty laughter was the biggest part of our friendship. But @CAPS3 not sure if we just think we're funny or if other people think we're funny. My two best @CAPS2 are @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2. I've actually known both of them since we were little kids. It was about second grade when we first became @CAPS2. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. Nowadays @CAPS3 closer @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, then I am to @LOCATION1. I vividly remember when @LOCATION2 and I would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room, nearly missing our teacher. The first memory I have @CAPS1 @PERSON2 was maybe when we were in third grade. We would goof off and mess around in @LOCATION3. The three of us haven't hung out a lot since high school started. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and I do hang out, we're always laughing and having a great time. One example of laughter bringing us together is when we went to @PERSON1 skate park for my birthday a few years back. @PERSON2's grandma was taking us there and along the way we asked if we could stop and get @ORGANIZATION1. I just got an @CAPS4 camera for my birthday so I decided to bring that along. We went to the @ORGANIZATION1's located on @NUM1 street. As we were going through the drive - thru and @PERSON2's grandma was ordering. @PERSON2 decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was. He asked for a @ORGANIZATION2 and a large fry. What made this really funny was that his grandma was getting really mad. She sternly told @PERSON2 to stop and told the person over the mic not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @PERSON2 kept doing it anyways. When we were pulling up to the window to get the food @PERSON2 told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food. So as we were pulling up @PERSON2 rolled his window up and down and got the food. @CAPS3 so glad I brought my camera and recorded the whole thing. When we got there we hopped out of the car and went to the park. It was later in the day when we got there, probably about three or four in the afternoon. At first none of us really skated cause we were looking around curiously. But when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours. Because when we left it was completely dark outside. There are four stair sets there, the two - stair, the three - stretch, the three - block and the five - stair. That's the order they go in from size and how hard it is to @PERSON3 them. Since we were there for so long we had a lot of videos recorded. Some were of us skating skillfully, some were really random and funny, then others I don't know what the heck was going on in them. Later that day when we were tired and bored of being there @PERSON2's grandma came and picked us up. They both came over to my house when we got back. We just watched @CAPS5 and played video games. It's always funny to watch one of us get frustrated because we're not winning. Eventually we stopped and listened to music. Around @NUM2 p.m @PERSON2 went home and @LOCATION2 stayed the @TIME1. As we were in my living room he was messing around @CAPS1 the tri - pod I had got @CAPS1 my camera. As he has it in his hands, he's unscrewing it and it falls apart. We both laughed at first but then I got mad cause I just got that. This day was really fun, it was full of laughing, dedication to skating, and our friendship. It was a day that I felt even closer to @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2.
417	21233	8	3	"Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 when you're little, you're exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 when your parents step in. They lovingly feed, and care for and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they patiently teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just affects the people around you, @CAPS2 also affects you. You can ask anyone if once in their life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference by making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 when I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was back to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but you're not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seems to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 how it felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 why I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 when she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 when people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid you're vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. It's all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. It helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age."
418	21235	8	3	"A great day for an adventure @CAPS5 when my sister invited me to her Christian school called @PERSON1. @CAPS1 It was a nice sunny day and then @CAPS1 it turned into a not - so - sunny day. Woke up on the first day of visiting my sister in her new school. We went to all her classes with her. The teachers were kinda weird and so were her friends. After the second period in @PERSON1 we went to her @CAPS2.E class. The teacher said to put on running shoes because we are going to run up a mountain. My sister had forgotten to put on her running shoes so the teacher sent me and her to go get them. After we got the shoes the class was already a quarter of a mile away from the school. So me and my sister decided to take a short cut, so we took the off - road ""the scenic route"". We had ran down a hill and @CAPS1 it was really steep. My sister got half - way down the hill and slid on her butt all the way down. After she went I went, so I ran down the hill faster than I had ever ran in my life and I hit the pavement at the bottom. I was like a tumble - weed in a hurricane. My sister helped me up and we started running toward the class and they were in ""shock"" of what me and my sister looked like. My sister looked like she had just got done playing in the mud. Me, on the other hand, looked like I got hit by a truck and my face was covered in dirt. @CAPS3 After me and my sister got back we decided to get cleaned up. So we went to the showers. The showers at @PERSON1 are similar to the ones in @CAPS4.H.S but with shower curtains. The shower that I had used, the curtain had come off this metal hook. And I wasn't being smart and used a plastic stepping stool. The ground was still wet from @CAPS5 when I had taken a shower and the stool slipped and my pinky got caught on the hook and I sliced @CAPS1 open on a main vein in my pinky. I started getting light - headed and I passed out. My sister and her friends took me to my sister's room and put a band - aid on @CAPS1 @CAPS5 while I was still passed out. After I woke up I found myself between a blanket and a really uncomfortable bed. My sister was waiting for me to wake up and told me to never scare her like that again. @CAPS5 When she said that I told her how I thought @CAPS1 was funny @CAPS5 when we ran down the hill. I didn't do much damage except for giving me some scrapes and how my pinky made me pass out."
419	21236	8	3	Every @DATE1 my family, friends, and I excitedly pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION1. We always take our @CAPS3 runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degrees, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the cool water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS1. There are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION1 like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather than my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON1 was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM1 mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON1 got up on the @CAPS3 runner I hopped on the tube and I told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS3 wave your arms around like you're crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS3 wave I would get whip - flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON1 was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back - flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp
420	21237	8	3	"When you laugh, what are you thinking about? Who are you with? What are you doing ? When you were three you laughed because someone went, ""@CAPS1-a-boo""and they contorted their face. When you were thirteen you laughed because someone looked different and wasn't wearing clothes that were ""in"". By the time your twenty-three you laugh with your friends because your friend is drunk and doing something stupid in the middle of the party. But when you find yourself at thirty-three your laughing while your husband is wrestling your five year old. Well about three years back my brother and I finally figured out how to have a relationship.   The @PERSON1 family has always been complicated. When we tell people how we are related, their response is always, ""@CAPS2...What? Start over!"", so we try to avoid the topic. My brother @PERSON2 has lived in @LOCATION2 his whole life with his mother and step @CAPS3, so neither our @CAPS3 or I really had a close relationship with him. Although it wasn't our dads fault, we only saw @PERSON2 maybe twice a year. In those two times a year, @PERSON2 and my sister @PERSON3, would always pick on me, hide from me and laugh at me because I couldn't do what they could. I used to hate it when he was coming down, because I knew I would spend most of that time crying and getting in trouble for things I didn't do. When three kids grow up together they find that they like each other better when they get along. My brother wasn't so mean to me anymore and he figured out that we were on the same side against the common enemy: @CAPS3. Our relationship has always grown around laughter, we get along because we are able to make jokes about one another everyday and know that it means nothing. Its our way of showing we care about each other, sometimes we laugh at other people and sometimes we laugh at ourselves. Now that my brother is off at college, we actually miss each other, and the key to our relationship is the laughter we share.  When my brother found that he actually liked me, he taught me everything about video games and helped me, we were not only on the same team in the video game, but also in real life. Summer @DATE1 my brother and I were sitting at home, bored because @CAPS3 was at work and @PERSON2 didn't have a car in @LOCATION1. We decided to play all the video games at least once throughout that endless day. That challenge didn't last long because the first and last game we played that day was @CAPS4 @NUM1. We started off just figuring out how it worked and where to go and we fought about it for a good hour. Then we started playing just to see who's team won, we started making jokes about each others players and we gave all the bad players, mean, really weird names, we laughed through the whole game. Then to make things more interesting we got into making our own characters and building a fantasy draft. @PERSON2, being a guy, came up with the grossest names and made the players look either really scary or really funny, he stacked their stats so they had an overall team average of @PERCENT1 in everything. I, being a girl, made all my guys really hot and muscular with funny names and only stacked their stats to what I thought was reasonable, depending on their good looks, so my team average was only @PERCENT2. From the moment of the tip, to the the moment we looked at the final stats for the game, we were laughing. Every time the announcer said one of our players names in that basketball context, it was so wrong but so funny, ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 for two"". When both teams made every shot and then by some chance somebody missed one, we made so many comments and jokes. By the time @CAPS3 had gotten home, he thought something was wrong because we were crying so hard from laughing, that our tan carpet had turned brown . Even through dinner, when we had calmed down, @PERSON2 would say something only I would know what it meant and we would just burst out laughing and @CAPS3 would look at us with a dumbfounded expression. Looking back I wouldn't trade anything for that day.  Now @PERSON2 and I sometimes bring up that day when we start playing a sports game or were just talking on the phone. We laugh and use context to make fun of each other. Ya you could say its not a very normal relationship, but that's how we know we love each other, because truth is, I don't even like video games, I only ever play a video game when he wants to. So since that day we have become closer, we don't fight, and we actually stand up for each other. So who ever said, "" Laughter is the shortest distance between to people."" is right."
421	21238	8	3	"It seems like every single day of everyone's life, they are being tested in every possible way, shape, and form, and it truly seems like it will never end. It gets to be extremely stressful and complicated, but this is precisely what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter. No matter how horribly bad things get to be, it can always be changed by a simple knock - knock joke, a funny comic ad, or just one kind word from a best friend. I've been with my dad and a couple of his high - school buddies as they are vividly telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend @CAPS1 went off into a story about when they bought a @NUM1 @LOCATION1 tempest for @MONEY1. It turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life. This was my dad's second car he ever had with a @NUM2 and a @NUM3 speed; with that setup, anything was possible. It started out when my dad first drove it to school, which didn't last long because an hour later, @CAPS1 and my dad left, doing a burn - out on the speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a real burn - out animal; backing up and then side - stepping the clutch to second, and it would all be up in smoke. One day, my dad was sliding around gravel corners, and one of the rear bias - ply tires blew out. It threw that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty badly. Joe Enders pulled him out, and half a gallon of Dera glass, a hammer, and a can of paint later, it was ready to go again. The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car because he needed something to get him back and forth to work. So my dad hands him the keys and says, ""Keep it on @NUM3 wheels"". Two weeks later on a weekend, he was out messing around, and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out, but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. After that, it had an ""organ transplant"" of a roof from a @CAPS2 that hit a tree. @NUM5 weeks later, and it's ready to go again. Now, it's just something about a rear - wheel - drive car and snow that makes us kids again. Sliding around in the snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and @CAPS1 were driving in the snow, having a great time when the back end decided to trade places with the front. They lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the pole, and it was the end of the fun. Finally, the car had died, and my dad had brought the car back home. He decided not to fix it and parted it out. He sold the @NUM3 speed for @NUM7 @MONEY1, the engine for @NUM8, and the rear end for @NUM9. The trunk and hood weren't far behind for another @NUM9. The seat, steering column, and radio my dad kept, and the rest was scrap. So all in all, my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless @LOCATION2, and I hope someday soon I can have memories like that."
422	21240	8	3	I think that laughter is a very crucial and important part of life, and sometimes it greatly helps people when they're feeling down. One time, I was with my cousin, and she was having a truly bad day. She was extremely stressed, deeply upset, and she didn't know what to do. So she came over, and she got really emotional. I gently told her that it was okay to cry. Then, after a while when she calmed down a bit, I told her that life wasn't always going to be easy. I said that a lot of people said life was like a box of chocolates; you just gotta eat @NUM1 at a time. Some @MONTH1 be sweet, and the others might not be so good. But I then told her that life was more like a jar of jalapenos. What you do now @MONTH1 burn your butt tomorrow. And she just burst out laughing. Right then and there, she smiled and laughed so heartily that I knew she was going to be okay. She just needed some time to cool off and regain her composure. Then, after all that, she had a good day. She stayed the @TIME1, and we just cozily watched movies and listened to music. That's why I think it's really good to laugh, and besides, you lose calories that way, ha - ha. Laughter truly has the power to turn a gloomy day into a bright one.
423	21241	8	3	"Laughter is important. During the last two weeks of school, I was told the best news ever. My mom had excitedly told me that I would be flying to @LOCATION1, all by myself. I was extremely excited because I haven't seen my family in quite a while. Even though @CAPS1 been on a plane a couple of times, I was still awfully scared. I have never flown by myself, so this was going to be something extremely new and nerve - wracking. Even though I was excited and scared at the same time, I just kept vividly thinking about seeing everyone in my family, and even meeting family members that I have never seen or heard from before. School seemed to be going by at a snail's pace, and I was very anxious. When two weeks passed, I already had my bags neatly packed and was fully ready to go. My mom was trying really hard not to cry, but she did anyways. I nervously walked through the metal detectors and then down a long, echoing hallway. Finally, I had got on the plane. On the plane ride, I was constantly thinking about meeting my real dad, and that's all I was thinking about the whole time I was on the plane. I landed in @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 pm that day. I was glad too because I was utterly tired. My sister picked me up from the airport. Me and my sister didn't have a close relationship, so it was kind of awkward at first. She started talking about the good old times when we were younger, and how we had so much fun. Since I was in @LOCATION1, I wanted to see a lot of my family members. Most of my family members already knew that I was in town; news travels fast there. When my aunts saw me, they were in total shock. They said that I had grown so much. I was so happy because it was one of the best moments ever. I met so many people, especially family friends. It was amazing because I even met some of my mom's school friends. Days after, I had got a text message from one of my sisters that I have never seen or met before, and she was so overjoyed to know that I was in town. She told me that she and my dad wanted to see me and spend some quality time together, so we made meticulous plans. I was really nervous because the only time that I have seen my dad was when I was really young. That was fifteen years ago. I really didn't know what I was going to do or say when I was finally going to meet them. I was very scared, so I decided to take my sister and my cousin just so it wouldn't be too awkward. We decided to meet at my grandma's house. I haven't seen her in awhile, and unfortunately, she wasn't there. When my dad got there, I didn't know what to do. I didn't recognize him, or even my other sister. We gave each other warm hugs. When we got into the house, we were all quiet at first, and all my dad could say was ""@CAPS2"" because I had grown so much. He then started talking about the silly little things I did when I was a little girl, and it made us all laugh heartily. All we did was laugh, and it made me cry a little. If it wasn't for laughing, my relationship with my dad couldn't have been better. Laughter truly has the power to break the ice and mend relationships."
424	21244	8	3	"So one time, my friends Chad, Justin, and I decided to ding - dong ditch this old man. The reason we did this is that we would walk by his house every single day, and he would always turn on his sprinkler and this really annoying alarm thing. So at around nine or ten at night, we stealthily walked over to his house. We banged on his door as loudly as we could and then ran away very fast. It was so funny because when we got back from running, we went to our friend Taylor's house. We were sitting in the garage, just basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished. About ten seconds later, we heard loud banging on the garage door. At first, we were kinda startled, so we quickly ran into Taylor's room. And that's when it happened... the funniest thing ever. The old man just started screaming and banging on the door. Then he yelled, ""Come out, boys! What are you afraid of?!"" And we just cracked up in uncontrollable laughter. Well, he totally knew we were in there, so he went to the front door and started banging on that, which ended up waking up Taylor's mom. Well, we ended up going out and talking to the guy. He said he called the cops because he said it happened all the time. And we firmly denied it was us, but it totally was. So we couldn't help but laugh in his ugly face. He seriously looked like a turtle crossed with an eighty - year - old rapist. He had these big liver spots on his face and a terrible grey combover that wasn't fooling anyone at all. By the time the cops showed up, the guy was long gone. We told the cop that he was senile and didn't know what the hell he was talking about. So we got off scot - free. It was so funny and awesome, a prank that will always stay in our memories."
425	21245	8	3	"What exactly is laughter? Is it when something truly virtuous happens and it makes a person genuinely joyful? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words, it's a light - hearted, fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but it also plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this completely empty - headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming extinct. It had been almost two years exactly since she and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would ever bring us together. Until one day when I was at the store, and we unexpectedly ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing uncontrollably. Right then and there, we figured out that the argument we had was utterly pointless and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story, without laughter, my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people, what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy your company? You usually tell jokes or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, the physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person, you often notice that those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship, laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job or going to a job interview, and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation? Either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well, at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, and also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college, and she was struggling to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS3 didn't know what to do. No money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment. She just was a complete mess. Until one day, she told me that she received a call from her sister, and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma gently grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances, but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's too short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" @CAPS2 and there @CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was absolutely true. You can't live through life in a drag; you just have to get up and take it. @CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandma's loss, but @CAPS2 again, she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this, she wouldn't have ever known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crises. She will always love her grandma. When you learn how to take life as it comes, people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways, or some just don't learn at"
426	21246	8	3	"Laughing at @CAPS1 bell. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a plethora of funny, absolutely hilarious memories together. We're constantly finding something to laugh about, whether @CAPS7's something utterly stupid or genuinely really funny. We often laugh at things like people with comical looks or those who say idiotic things. Also, we find humor in the funny things we do ourselves. One thing that has always firmly stuck in @CAPS11 head is the time at @CAPS1 bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to cross the street from our school and have lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We placed our food orders and went to sit down to wait for @CAPS7. A few minutes later, our food was ready, and we sat down to dig into @CAPS7. ""@CAPS4"" I said to @LOCATION1 as I took a big bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five - layer burrito. ""@CAPS6"" @CAPS7 was extremely hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth. I had to wait a few minutes to continue eating @CAPS11 burrito. So we just sat there, waiting for our burritos to cool off, and chatted about school and other happenings in our lives. A couple of minutes later, a man walked in. He was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back to us, so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile, I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cool enough and went to take a bite. At the same time, the man looked at us, and he was wearing a clown mask and had a little dog with a tiara on its head. Next thing I knew, @CAPS11 burrito was flying out of @CAPS11 mouth, and I was dying of laughter. @CAPS11 burrito was completely spat out of @CAPS11 mouth and landed all over me and @LOCATION1. It got all over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and the table. I was so embarrassed, yet I couldn't stop myself from laughing. I think the main reason I was laughing so hard was that the man looked so incredibly scary. Wow, we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, but @CAPS7 only gets worse. Eating @CAPS11 burrito felt like an eternity because we were laughing non - stop. It probably took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile, I got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. As I was returning to @CAPS11 table, I wasn't paying attention and ran into a man in line. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10, but luckily I didn't. Back at @CAPS11 seat, I was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then I took a drink and started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10. It was so bad that I spit everything out onto @LOCATION1. @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, and it even came out of @CAPS11 nose. So I went into the bathroom, cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 I was ready to go home. When I look back on the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only recall how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her but also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that I'll probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life. As I said before, @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and we're still creating more every day."
427	21247	8	3	"There is a clear difference between right and wrong. Most of us learn from this distinction, while some of us don't. We all have a choice: either to face up to @CAPS3 we have done wrong or just lie about it and get into even more trouble than we already are. Ever wondered when you're about to do something wrong and you don't think first? Well, this was one of those times when I wasn't thinking clearly. I was nine years old. @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, and I were playing at the park, joking around, having a great time on the old rusted blue swing set. There wasn't much to do at the park other than shoot hoops, run around, use the monkey bars that were full of bacteria, go down the wet slide, and play tag if we had the energy. @ORGANIZATION1 spots two rusted, broken - down cars that look like they've been there for ages. @ORGANIZATION1 says out of his foolish mind, ""We should go over there and throw rocks at those cars, you guys."" I shake my head, nodding at @ORGANIZATION1 with a wide grin on my face. @PERSON1, who has zero tolerance for any negativity, says, ""@CAPS1 we shouldn't. Those cars are owned by somebody. How would you feel if some idiot kids came and wrecked your cars?"" I think for a moment, and well, he does have a valid point. I'd be furious if some idiot kids did that to my car. We all look at each other, wondering @CAPS3 to do. Sixteen minutes pass, and still, we haven't decided. With my foolish brain, I say, ""@CAPS2's, do those cars even belong to anyone? They don't even look like they can move. They look like they've been sitting there since the dinosaurs were around."" @PERSON1 walks off and mumbles to himself, ""@CAPS3 idiot kids. I already know they're going to get into trouble."" @ORGANIZATION1 and I look at each other as if we've just seen a ghost. We finally start making our way towards the rusty broken - down cars. On the way there, @ORGANIZATION1's clumsy feet trip over a piece of wood. Finally, we reach the two rusty broken - down cars. I pick up a rock. I pause for a second, asking myself if this is okay and if I should be doing this. But with the pressure and a guilty conscience, I throw the rock. One after another, I keep throwing rocks, pipes, car parts, logs, and even start beating the cars with a gigantic metal pipe. @ORGANIZATION1 and I leave, exhausted. We take a break and look at @CAPS3 we've done to those rusty broken - down cars. The two cars look like they've been hit by a tornado. @ORGANIZATION1 and I start laughing our heads off. We laugh so hard that we're almost about to wet ourselves. There was @CAPS1 no one around, and we thought no one had seen us. At least that's what we thought. It was about four days later, and @PERSON1 and I were back at the park, with no sign of @ORGANIZATION1. As we're about to go home from the park, a tall, blond, old lady with big feet walks up to us and asks us in a rather strange way, ""@CAPS4 do you two live?"" We were just kids at the time, and I say without thinking, ""I live right down the street. It's the second to the last house. I'll show you if you'd like."" The lady with big feet replies, ""@CAPS5 that would be great, thanks."" @PERSON1 and I start walking home, just wondering why that lady wanted to know @CAPS4 we live. When we get around the block, we see that lady's car in front of my house. @PERSON1 and I look at each other, and I know @CAPS3 he's thinking. @PERSON1 is thinking that I'm in big trouble. The lady with the big feet ended up being the owner of those two rusty broken - down cars. I didn't know @CAPS3 what to say or do. The thought going through my mind was that I was really screwed. I've never been so grounded and punished hard in my life. If there are some lessons that @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, and I have learned, it would be not to touch anything that isn't yours, to be respectful of @CAPS3 that isn't yours, to treat everything with respect even if it's not yours, and not to be foolish kids again. This experience has shown @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, and me the difference between right and wrong, the importance of telling the truth, facing up to @CAPS3 we've done wrong, and thinking before our actions get us in trouble."
428	21248	8	3	"Dozing off into space, I was as relaxed as I could be in a hot, stuffy room. @CAPS1 was lying next to me, and we were both thinking of things to do. But nothing came to mind. We both decided that it was too hot to do anything outside, and there was nothing interesting on TV. We thought we were just going to lie in bed all day, wasting away in the heat. But then @CAPS1 came up with the idea to play some video games. So we turned up some music and blasted the stereo. We put in some @CAPS2 Of @CAPS3 and started having a great time, virtually ""killing people"" in the game. We were really into it, having a lot of fun and feeling like we were winning big. Then @CAPS1 said, ""@CAPS5 I'm getting really tired, and it's getting really warm."" So I decided to try fixing the AC. While I was working on the AC, @CAPS1 was just lying in bed. Time passed slowly. It seemed like the day would never end. We had nothing else to do and felt stuck. Then @CAPS1 started telling me a joke. It was a cheesy one, but it still made me laugh. So there we were, sitting on her bed, telling each other jokes to pass the time. After a while, the jokes got old, and we were sitting on her bed again, about to fall asleep because there was nothing else we could do. The music was off, the window was open, and all you could hear were the cars driving by on the street. Out of nowhere, @CAPS1 let out a fart, and it was not a dainty, girly fart. It was loud and stinky. Right away, I started to laugh. While she was getting embarrassed, for some reason, I also farted. She started cracking up laughing, and her face turned red. Then we both started farting back and forth. Remember, we were in the sixth grade at the time. But nothing was as funny as what was about to happen. It was @CAPS1's turn to fart. She was all set, and then she let one out. But this was not like any other fart! She stopped laughing right away, looked at me with a frown on her face, and said, ""@CAPS10 I think I just pooped my pants!"" I started laughing so hard that I started to cry. It was that bad, and you could really smell it. Then she started walking to the bathroom, and all I heard was, ""@CAPS10 I just pooped my freaking pants!!"
429	21249	8	3	It was the first day of the ninth grade, a terrifying day when one has to decide how they want to be perceived for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like an over - the - top hippie. I was just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds, a long - haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and this made it hard for bullies to have the nerve to treat me like a typical freshman. I sat down in my assigned seat, next to a girl who clearly thought too highly of herself. Despite this off - putting first impression, I attempted to make friends. My attempt was met with confusion and disgust. As I turned to face the front of the class, there stood the teacher. @PERSON1 announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation that would show the rest of the class who we were. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I've always been a showman, and the spotlight is like a close friend. I love to act, sing, and generally entertain. However, my greatest strength is humor. I've discovered that I can captivate an audience, no matter the size, with humor. With this in mind, I designed a presentation to engage my class and show them the real me. I wrote a speech where I explained my talents and the things I enjoy. In this speech, there were many clever turns of phrase, funny punchlines, and puns. The laughter in the class was so loud that other teachers came to see what was causing the commotion. I took a bow and sat back in my seat, looking around at the beaming faces of my new friends. I knew right then that laughter would be the key to building my high - school life. I could make someone forget their troubles for a while or brighten their day with just a few words. I wasn't a star athlete, and I wasn't even a top student. But I seemed to attract friends easily, like a flypaper attracts flies. There's no better feeling than being surrounded by friends. As long as I have humor, I'll always have that wonderful feeling of friendship.

431	21251	8	3	"Laughter has numerous benefits, including inducing feelings of happiness and joy, facilitating bonding with others, triggering an adrenaline rush, and helping to release tension. The daily joking around us also adds to its charm. Laughter is a shareable emotion, especially among those feeling down. It can brighten any day and bring enjoyment. Laughter has been a significant part of my life. Whether it's with family, friends, boyfriends, or even strangers, laughter always holds great importance to me. I love seeing someone who smiles often, as it likely means they laugh a lot and are a happy person. How can I tell? Well, for starters, they may have dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corners of their eyes. These crows feet can appear regardless of age, resulting from frequent laughing, smiling, or squinting in the sun. The most significant aspect of laughter in my life is its role in relationships. Usually, when there's laughter in a relationship, it tends to last longer. The reason is that you can be yourself and let the other person see that you're comfortable laughing and being part of their life. I believe that laughter is the best part of a relationship. For instance, if your partner is in a bad mood, will you let them be moody all day or try to make them laugh and cheer them up? When I'm in a relationship and my partner is being moody, I try my best to cheer them up. I love making people laugh. And when I'm in a bad mood, my boyfriend is helpful, either trying to make me feel better or comforting me to find out what's wrong. So, if there's no laughter in your relationship, there will obviously be no happiness, and it probably won't work out. Therefore, spread the joy of life and make people happy. Another important part of laughter in my life is with friends. If you don't know me well, let me tell you that I'm shy at first, but once I get comfortable with you, you'll see that I'm a very outgoing person. Most of my friends say I'm weird, but I enjoy laughing a lot and making others laugh too. When I'm with my friends and feeling down, someone will always manage to make me laugh in the end. No matter how upset I am, they can always make me laugh at almost anything because I'm easily entertained. Being around these friends is like watching a comedy show. They're always finding ways to be funny and a bit annoying, like being obnoxious and doing stupid things that others wouldn't do because it's embarrassing. But just because it's embarrassing doesn't mean you shouldn't try it. If you don't, it gives us more to do and all the attention. How can you know if something is funny if you don't try something new? How can you laugh at yourself and have others laugh with and at you, no matter how silly it is? So, don't judge until you've tried. The person who said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" is it true or false? Is it really the shortest or the longest? I honestly think it could be a short distance. You don't want to be snooty or crabby all the time, or you'll never make friends or have relationships. And if you don't have friends or relationships, who will make you laugh and help you enjoy life? If you're not a happy person, how can you experience the joys of life and the world around you? You won't, so put a smile on your face and be a spontaneous person without fear. Laughter is beneficial to all of humanity. In my life, laughter has shown me so much and brought enjoyment to me and others. The joys I've experienced include having boyfriends, friends, and family around me. This emotion can brighten any day and bring happy expressions to everyone's faces. So, share the laughter."
432	21253	8	3	"Laughter is undoubtedly the best way to bring people closer together. It forges a bond that makes you feel a bit more at ease and secure. Imagine how sad and depressing life would be if there were no laughter. Everyone has a distinct type of laugh; some are loud, some are quiet, some are weird, and some are funny. Our laughter is what truly makes us who we are. There are numerous effects that occur during the process of laughing. Your laugh can have such a powerful impact on your body that it can cause your eyes to become slightly teary. Sometimes, when you laugh, it becomes harder to breathe, and your stomach might start to ache. When something is really funny, I usually struggle to take another breath because I can't stop laughing. That's one of the effects that happen to me while I'm laughing. Everyone knows that when someone finds something amusing, they laugh. We can laugh at a movie, a joke, or even a simple mistake. My family always manages to make me laugh. When we have parties, we're always laughing and cracking jokes. One of the jokes my cousins said was that my aunt's baby was so white that it looked like it came out of La Lechera. ""Lechera"" is a Spanish word. Another incident that made me laugh was when I went to my cousin's house. We were watching a movie, and I had to go to the restroom. When I came out, she jumped out from around the corner and scared me. I screamed so loudly that my other cousin yelled from upstairs to be quiet. I couldn't stop laughing. I was scared, but it was funny because she scared me out of nowhere, and I never expected her to do that. I consider laughing to be a precious gift. It's something that can always brighten our day. I love to laugh, and there are so many unforgettable moments when I almost laughed until I peed my pants. I believe that the people with the best personalities are those who can make others laugh. Laughter truly has the power to make life more enjoyable and bring people together."
433	21255	8	3	"When you hear a child laugh, what comes to your mind? Do you think of peace and happiness, or something else? When I hear a child laugh, I immediately think of my little sister. Whether we're outside playing Peter Pan or inside playing with dolls, she lights up like a bright light, and I can clearly see her happiness. It's not just my sister's laugh that brings me joy; it's everyone's! However, I do think a child's laugh is the most unique. When you hear your child, niece, nephew, or grandchild laugh, you should be able to sense their happiness. As you grow older, a laugh changes. I remember when my sisters and brothers were younger, they would laugh at the simplest things. But now, they laugh at sick and disgusting jokes and laugh when someone gets teased. That's not the case for me. I'm the one who laughs when someone does something silly, like in America's Funniest Home Videos. A child laughs when you make a funny face or when an animal does something funny. They laugh at the littlest things. To me, a smile is just a silent laugh. I remember hearing the saying ""A smile is worth a thousand words,"" and I think it applies to laughter too! Even though there's no sound in a smile, there's a potential for laughter waiting to burst out. I know for a fact that when I was younger, I was abused. So, whenever something good happened, which was very rare, I would have a huge smile on my face. Then, if someone did something funny, I would try not to laugh, but I could only hold out for about 5 seconds. Then, I would start laughing so hard that I would start to cry. There's one specific time that stands out as the highlight of my life. One day, I was hanging out with my sister Linda, and we were playing with dolls. My dad walked in and accidentally stepped on one of the dolls. Linda started to cry because the arm had been broken off. But as soon as she started to cry, my dad started hopping on one foot, holding the other, and then he fell on his butt. I laughed so hard that afternoon! Later that day, he took me and Linda to the store to each buy a new doll. Once again, I must say that a child's laughter is the most beautiful thing on earth! For some reason, it heals the soul. If you start your day badly, you can come home at the end of the day and hear your child laughing, and suddenly, your day gets better. I wish I could be a child again to relive those simple and happy moments. Every laugh is unique, and as we grow older, our reasons for laughing may change, but the power of laughter remains the same. It can always bring light to our lives."
434	21256	8	3	"Boy says to [someone]: ""What's the weight?"" [Someone] replies: ""What?"" Boy says: ""I just wanted to say something to break the ice!"" Laughter is truly the greatest thing to have in any kind of relationship, whether it's with family, friends, or in a romantic relationship. It creates a strong bond and makes the relationship full of playfulness. It was [date], and I was on my way to pick up a long - time - no - see friend to go to a Warped Tour concert. We hadn't been on the best terms due to an issue that had occurred a few months ago. I decided to take my friend [name] to the concert she'd been wanting to go to all year. When we finally picked her up, there was a lot of tension from the unsaid words between us, but I wasn't going to wait any longer to see what would happen. Before we headed to the concert, my parents decided to get a car wash. Then, I immediately thought of a few funny things I could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slowly as a turtle into the car - wash machine. I left the window cracked just enough for some water to seep in. We were chatting about the concert, and I pretended to be completely unaware that my window was open. In fact, I really didn't expect so much water to come in. She looked at me and started laughing so hard that she could hardly speak. I looked at her and asked, ""What?"" She said, ""Your window's open!"" I turned and saw that water was rushing in, which startled me. I jumped up and quickly closed the window. She was laughing uncontrollably, and so was I. From that moment on, it was a great ice - breaker for all the tension that had been there. The awkwardness was gone, and we had a wonderful rest of the day. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" When laughter is present, no one is truly sad, mad, or in a bad mood. Laughter can make a good first impression between two people who just meet, bring couples closer together, and bring joy and happiness to friends and family. Laughter is indeed the key to happiness. It has the power to transform a tense situation into a pleasant one and make life more enjoyable."
435	21257	8	3	"Laughter is one of the most important things in life. It can range from a simple joke to an unbelievable event that becomes a great memory to share among family members. It helps you through tough times, makes someone's day better, puts a smile on their face, and can start a chain of laughter among people. Sometimes, it can be the most embarrassing thing people remember about you, but in the end, the person laughing at you might have done something similar in the past and just doesn't realize it. I remember on my fifteenth birthday, my grandma took the whole family out to a Chinese restaurant. It was quiet except for the adults discussing what to order from the family meals. I was sitting beside my sister, looking at the menu to see what they had to drink. Her mind was on other things, and out of nowhere, she blurted out, ""They have no fricken chicken!"" Everyone burst into laughter, including the waitress's son who was standing behind our booth and his mother. It really brightened everyone's day because it wasn't the best of days at that time. But you could tell she was embarrassed, yet she also laughed at herself. Her comment to the table was, ""I thought I said it in my head."" I looked at her and said, ""No, you didn't."" So, she just shrugged it off. To this day, whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant, my mom looks at her and says, ""They got your fricken chicken."" She replies, ""Will that ever die?"" We all look at her and say, ""No, it's going to be passed down to your children. They'll hear about their mother's fricken chicken day."" It was such a memorable incident that she gets upset that it won't go away, but it still makes everyone else laugh. Even though it happened so long ago, our parents joke that it'll be her wedding toast. It went something like this: ""As long as you give her, her fricken chicken, you [partner's name] will last forever."" It wasn't the nicest comment about that day, but it was still funny to the rest of us. This is something that will stay in the family for years to come and hopefully be passed down through the generations. Even if she doesn't want it to be talked about, in time, instead of us telling everyone about the incident, she'll probably tell them herself and just laugh about it because it was such an unexpected thing to happen. We still tease her about it and many other things she says out loud without realizing. But those are stories for another time. You never know what could happen. Just remember to laugh. It's true what they say - it's healthy for you. So, make the most of some of the worst days. If you're having a bad day, you never know what might happen to make you smile and laugh, even if you're the one causing everyone to laugh. Think of something that makes you laugh and share it with the people who are special in your life to brighten their day. Even if it's one of the most embarrassing events in your life, laughter can turn it into a happy memory. When we were little, laughter was often the cure for our sadness. Just because we grow"
436	21258	8	3	I think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship, because if you didn't have laughter then that would be one extremely boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of my own. I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is @CAPS1. We first met here at school and then he transferred and moved away. Then, a few months ago, he added me on Facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking, he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again, he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was tough for him to break up with her but he did it and I am really proud of him, because she treated him very badly. In the beginning of our relationship, we were both really shy and didn't talk much but the more and more that we hung out, the more we started talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts. Every time I see him, I get really nervous and it almost seems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street, I cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the couch and watch movies, I can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, whether it's when one of us makes a silly mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Every time he leaves, I cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it, I feel like it would be a really dull relationship. And if it is boring, then you wouldn't want to spend time with one another. I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of, as these moments filled with laughter are what make the relationship truly special.
437	21259	8	3	"Everyone in life has siblings that they grew up with and that they love unconditionally, but for some of us, we didn't know our siblings until later in life. I myself was one of those people but with a slight difference than some others. I had what I like to call a @PERSON1 who in actuality was my biological father. Up until I was seven years old, I thought that my dad @PERSON2 was my quote - on - quote ""real dad"". But one evening, I heard my mother downstairs yelling at someone on the phone. My mom was yelling at this unknown figure about child support and signing over his rights to my dad. I had no idea that who she was talking about was me and in fact, the one on the other end of the line was my biological father. The moment I heard ""your son deserves better than this"", I ran upstairs to my room and began to weep because I thought that @PERSON2 was my dad but now this new figure in my life was claiming to be. My mom had heard me run up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on. As it had turned out, my biological father had rights to my last name and unless he signed these over to my dad, my mom would take him to court and force him to pay the thousands he owed her for child support. During this little story that she was unveiling, I had learned that I have other siblings out there in the world. Over the next eight years of my life, I would spend countless hours running through old phone numbers and email addresses trying to find my other siblings. It wasn't until my freshman year that I met a guy who went to my school and was in the same grade as me, named @PERSON3. He quickly became one of my good friends and we hung out every other day. On one occasion that he was at my house playing video games with me, he chanced upon a question of what my last name was. I thought to myself that this was a peculiar question but in the end, I told him. All of the sudden, a smile crept across his face and he asked if I had a biological father named @CAPS1. My mind started to reel over this sudden question. @PERSON3 started to explain to me that he was half - brother to my sister @CAPS2 who was one of the siblings that I had been searching for. Almost before I could think to ask the question of how, he had called my sister and explained to her he had found her brother. As it had turned out, she had been looking for me just as hard as I was looking for her. @PERSON3 asked her if she would like to meet me and I heard a high - pitched squeal of joy from my sister saying yes on the phone. I too was overjoyed at the thought but I had no idea of how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next day. On the day that I met my sister, @CAPS4's mom had come to pick me up to take me to her house. As we were driving, so many thoughts were racing through my head that I thought I would puke in the car. When we finally arrived at her house, @PERSON4 who is @CAPS4's mom, urged me out of the car and into the house where my sister, who I realized looked almost the same as me, was sitting on the couch looking just as nervous as I was. During the next four long nerve - racking hours, my sister and I played 20 questions with each other to get to know one another. After doing this, we were more comfortable with each other and she looked a lot more accepting that I was truly her older brother. By the end of the day, we were telling jokes and laughing hysterically. We realized that we even had the same obnoxious laugh (that everyone hated) and that too made us hit the floor laughing. At one point in time, her mom had to tell us to quiet down because we were going to wake the baby if we didn't. And by the end of the day, we had connected with each other so much that she even gave me a hug before I left. @CAPS2 and I connected most through our laughter the first time we met and from that day to even now, every time we see each other we giggle and smirk. Since we found each other or in my case, her brother found me, I have gone to her house every other weekend. My sister is one of the most precious people I have in my life and that will never change because nothing we say or do will ever stop the laughing and joy we hold towards one another, and these shared moments of laughter will continue to strengthen our bond."
438	21261	8	3	We couldn't control ourselves. Our eyes were watering, and our stomachs were hurting so much we couldn't move. I was choking on my words as I talked to my best friend @PERSON1. Every time we talked to each other, someone would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about, most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop, @PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Then I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day, we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our classroom. Our 3rd grade teacher had lots of pets in her classroom and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week was @PERSON1's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him, @PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were choking on our words as we took our seats for class. We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually, our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quiet. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day, lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION1 and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would definitely hear us. It wasn't just us being loud; it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quiet but that didn't stop us. In fact, it made @LOCATION1 and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON1 and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quietly about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quiet so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next, she told us to let out our breath as big as we could. Lastly, we were supposed to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently without talking to anyone. When @PERSON1 and I were taking our five deep breaths, we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh their heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually, the class settled back down and started doing their work quietly. Except for @PERSON1 and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over. We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were supposed to. Even to this day, every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something, @PERSON1 and I look at each other and start laughing, and then we breathe really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think it's just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the 3rd grade. Through our friendship, we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together whether it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone. Laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in their lifetime. Not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hearty laugh where you can't control yourself, your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts so bad you can't move, just like @PERSON1 and I did in 3rd grade. These shared moments of uncontrollable laughter are what make our friendship so unique and special.
439	21262	8	3	"It all started one day after school, when my girlfriend and I decided to make a plan to go to my house. We were not planning to walk home because we missed the bus. So we began to walk down the ramp from the high school. While we were walking, we got hungry. So we went to the convenience store. We ordered a burger and some drinks. @PERSON1 decided to shake up my soda and said, ""Here's mine, let's trade."" I agreed and ended up opening the one she shook for real. ""That was a lil devious!"" I said. Then, when I stood up to chase her and pour soda on her, I tripped and fell on some goat heads. While I was in pain, @PERSON1 was cracking up with laughter and said, ""You're so stupid, who falls over a stump!"" After I got up from the ground and pulled all of the thorns out, we continued to walk home. We were already more than half way to my house, when @PERSON1 decided to hit me in the shin and run. Of course not learning my lesson the first time, I chased her. I chased her for about a block and a half, basically to my yard before I slid on mud, and then fell in a puddle of water. I thought I was going to lose it when @PERSON1 was laughing too dramatically. Out of anger, I jumped up and was going to put her face in it. She ended up running inside my house, and locking the door. The reason I knew she had locked it was because I ran so fast to bust in. Before I could, I turned the knob, but it didn't open though. Instead, the impact forced me to fly back, and land on poop. The bad part was that it was fresh, because my back was warm in a certain spot. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, and then headed inside to shower. @PERSON1 asked me why I was going to shower, but I decided to lie to her. If I told her what really happened, she will laugh and make fun of me. After I was done showering, I asked @PERSON1, ""Do you want to go shoot some glass bottles in the back?"" She replied, ""Sure, I'm down let's go!"" So I set up six bottles and was ready to shoot. First, @PERSON1 tried and hit four out of six. That's pretty good for being a girl. Then I went to replace the four bottles she shot. As I was doing that, she shot me in the butt. ""Ouch!"" I yelled and wanted to cry, but I didn't. The only thing I could do was swear like crazy, and aimed my gun at @PERSON1 to get her back. She was quick to run upstairs and grab my expensive item. She said"
440	21263	8	3	"I could just laugh to death. someone said. I sacned the area. ""@CAPS37?"" I said. ""@CAPS1 here son."" I looked @CAPS1 the stairs leading to @CAPS2 avenue. There was the sorce of the voice i had herd. @CAPS35 was only an old man probualy homeless by the looks of him. He had worn shoes, dirty blue jeans, a riped shirt under a worn jacket. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS31 @CAPS33 a little lost""The old man said. ""@CAPS4, I'm @CAPS73 lost"" said @PERSON1. His pocket started to vibrate. @PERSON1 reached into his pocket an pulled out his cell. He fliped @CAPS35 open and read: @CAPS31 going to be here soon? Tommey typed: ya bro just going onto @CAPS2 ave now. Message sent. @PERSON1 started to climb the steps. ""@CAPS5 @CAPS31 later old man"" said @PERSON1 as he dashed of to meet his friends. @PERSON1 saw his friends in site @CAPS62 were all standing outside of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 bakery. ""@CAPS3,guys @CAPS33 @CAPS35's @PERSON1!"" @CAPS34 @PERSON2. @PERSON2 ran at @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 scuped her @CAPS1 and spun her around one before puting her @CAPS66 @CAPS19. @CAPS62 proceeded to walk over to the group. ""@CAPS37 took @CAPS31 so long dude"" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS11, @CAPS63 the short cut i took turned out to be, @CAPS73 to short"" @PERSON1 repiled. ""@CAPS12 don't mind him he's just in a bad mood"" said @CAPS13. ""@CAPS14"" replied @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3, guys can we go into the @CAPS18 @CAPS19's toy store!!"" inqured @PERSON2. ""@CAPS20 that's fine"" replied @CAPS13 @CAPS22. The group proceeded @CAPS19 @CAPS2 avenue @CAPS24 turned right onto @ORGANIZATION1 street, @CAPS24 another right onto @CAPS25 avenue. The store was located halfway @CAPS19 in the middle of other boutiques. ""@CAPS26 were here"" said @PERSON2 as she spun around around from excitement. ""@CAPS24 let's go in"" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS30 old greblin!"" said @PERSON2. ""shh mu ha ha ha"" @CAPS31 got told said @CAPS13. ""@CAPS32"" he grumbled. Once inside the store @CAPS35 was like somone turned @CAPS9 the lights @CAPS9 bright. @CAPS73 only that but the store was filled from top to bottom with @CAPS38 but toys. The toys ranged from small to large to huge. There were all sorts of diffrent types. ""@CAPS33"" @CAPS34 @PERSON2. ""@CAPS35's a @CAPS43 bunny!""""@CAPS35'll smother @CAPS31 in your sleep twerp"" ""@CAPS37's eating @CAPS31?"" said @PERSON1. ""@CAPS38"" grumbbled @CAPS9 @CAPS10. WACK! The bunney conected with @CAPS9 @CAPS10's face. ""@CAPS43 meenie""""@CAPS44, that does @CAPS35"" he took a lion off the shelf and tossed @CAPS35 at @LOCATION2. ""@CAPS3, don't be mean to her!"" said @CAPS13 as she picted @CAPS1 a monester an flung @CAPS35 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. @CAPS35 missed and hit @PERSON1. @PERSON1 flung @CAPS35 @CAPS66 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""That's @CAPS35"" I @CAPS9 @CAPS10 challege @CAPS31. SMAK. ""@CAPS52"" @CAPS53 this. @CAPS53 that. @CAPS54 @CAPS54 @CAPS31 scum. @CAPS31 can't get me. WAM! Ha ha i'm ausome. TWACK!

441	21264	8	3	"I tend to always get myself into awkward situations with the people I love, but that's just life right? When you're a kid, you tend to be overly dramatic about every little thing. And to those who love you, like my parents at that time around @DATE1, they are trying to teach you something @DATE1 or lead you the right way. Or maybe that was just me being naive, haha? I moved out of my dad's place with a horrible bang. I was so eager to live life my way, which was only pushing the people I needed most, like my dad, away. I realized that a little too late. But again, that's just life right? Just about @DATE1, I finally ""rekindled the flame"" with my dad again. It was the hardest thing to do, considering my step - mom hates me. And it's obvious that's never going to change. So that's just something I'll have to deal with. My dad and I still had the most awkward relationship, till about a few months ago when we had gone on a fishing trip together. Standing there by the lake, casting away, there was nothing said. We both consider ourselves fairly humorous people, but even our jokes weren't breaking through the ice. We finally started making conversation when he started to tell me about when I was a kid going @DATE1 visiting my mom for the first time, then coming back to my grandma's @DATE1 calling her a......bad word...but I won't say which one. My dad hasn't really cursed around me before, I guess that's the result of time away from each other. It was pretty funny all these stories he was telling me, especially the way he was explaining them. That brought pretty happy laughter to us both. And that shared laughter really brought us back together again. It made me realize that no matter how awkward things were, family bonds can be mended."
442	21265	8	3	Have you ever laughed so hard that you couldn't really breathe or you started to cry? Well, I can tell you that I do that all the time and that laughter is a big part of my life. I remember when my family and I all went out to eat for dinner one night. My grandpa, who has a great love for Chinese food, wanted to go out to Chinese food in @LOCATION1. So my mom, my energetic little brother, my kind - hearted grandma, grandpa, my close friend @CAPS1 and I all went out to the Chinese @CAPS2. That night was memorable because that was the night that we had the whole table laughing at @CAPS1 and I. When @CAPS1 and I got done ordering our food, the waiter promptly brought us our appetizers and that's when the tears and laughter came out. It was ten minutes of chatting with @CAPS1 about this boy that she liked. And when she said the name, my crab puff, which I was holding carelessly, went launching toward her. I couldn't help but laugh so loud and hard. As @CAPS1 and I sat there and laughed about what had just happened, I had seen that @CAPS1 couldn't really open her mouth because she was laughing too hard and her cheeks hurt from all the laughing. She ended up drooling into the little sauce bowl that had soy sauce in it, and when seeing that, I knew that I couldn't help but not tell her at all. The night came to an end when @CAPS1 ended up dumping her water all over the waiter's son. I had to apologize to the waiter that night and his son too. His son said that it was okay because it happens to him all the time. Laughter is a big part of people's lives because laughing can make you happy, bring smiles to people's faces, and create long - lasting memories that you'll cherish forever.
443	21266	8	3	"This is the second time I have been to @ORGANIZATION1 and I can't wait to go on all the rides. The lines are extremely long, but I am with some family that I haven't seen for a while, so we talk and catch up on each other's lives. My uncle, who is there with us, has a penchant for playing tricks on the kids and embarrassing me. He has given me wedgies, put his kids' diapers under my pillow, and many more crazy tricks. I knew this trip would be no different, so I tried to stay clear of any plans he had in mind. @CAPS1 was going to be a rather warm day today, so I put on some comfortable basketball shorts and a t - shirt. We headed out with five kids under the age of @NUM1, so I knew we would be going on some smaller rides. After we went on ""@CAPS1's a small @ORGANIZATION1"", we decided @CAPS1 was time to go to the bigger rides but we would need some lunch first. We went to a burger shop and were waiting to get our food. So me and my uncle, being the playful ones, decided to have a spit ball war. We were shooting across the aisle from table to table, trying hard to dodge people walking by. I hit him twice in the side of the cheek, so he told me I had won. Once we ate our food and went outside to leave, he told me, ""@CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest"". I, not thinking about @CAPS1, said, ""That's easy!"" and lifted my brother up. Little did I know that was a big mistake. He walked over and pants - ed me in the middle of the walkway. I stood there with a kid above my head and my pants at my ankles. People sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen. I was so embarrassed. How could I be so stupid to fall for his trick? I couldn't believe I had fallen for @CAPS1 again. It happened so fast and I didn't know what to do other than chuckle inside. After that, we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes. They allowed for you to not have to wait in line and go to the front, but they could only be used for certain times. We had to wait for about twenty minutes and @CAPS1 was raining. So we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION2 ponchos and the kids were playing tag. My brothers were the loud, crazy kids that always have boundless energy and don't stop running. They would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away. After about the fifth time, I couldn't take @CAPS1 anymore, so I told them if they hit me again, they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes, I got hit in the back again, so I turned around and walked up to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. Little did I know I had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked up at me with a blank stare, wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree as my uncle and parents were apologizing for what I had done. Although my family was embarrassed for what I had done, they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time. I had no idea that the kid wasn't my brother and could only imagine what that kid was feeling like. This trip, full of both embarrassing and funny moments, will always be etched in my memory."
444	21268	8	3	Laughter is a part of my life. When I laugh, I always have this feeling of pure happiness and a strong connection with others. Laughter makes any relationship stronger. I remember when I was sad, I would go and talk to my friend @PERSON2. I went to him because we could have deep conversations about why I was feeling that way. Then after a while, with his comforting words and our shared sense of humor, we would be laughing - being happy. Laughter brought me closer to my friend. We were able to understand each other on a deeper level. We have been friends since we were in elementary school, where we shared many innocent and funny moments. Because of the laughter in our relationship and the wonderful memories of days when we laughed uncontrollably, it has made this relationship last. I have been mad at my friend and he has been mad at me. But because of all those good times we have had laughing together, like the time we got stuck in the rain and made a game out of it. We are still great friends. Here is a time when laughter was in one of my friend relationships. @PERSON2, @PERSON1 and I were at @ORGANIZATION1's house. It was a lazy @DATE1. We were listening to music and having casual talks about stuff. We didn't do much that day. Except the thing that they were about to do. Out of nowhere, @PERSON2's little nephew, who is always full of energy, starts dancing and laughing while doing it. @PERSON1 gets up and does the same, showing off his funny dance moves. @PERSON2 then gets up too - it was something I didn't expect to happen. They chose a certain song and made a dance for it. The whole time this was happening, we were all having a great time. They all looked so funny doing their dance. After a while, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 got tired. But we kept on laughing because @PERSON2's nephew kept on dancing with so much enthusiasm. They danced to this song a few other times that @DATE1. It was still funny to me the last time as it was the first time they did it. Laughter connected my friendship many other times. This one though, is the one I mostly remember because it was so funny and spontaneous. I remember it like if it was just last week. Being happy in a relationship makes it last a long time. That is why I think laughter is important and it does really make any relationship stronger. I have this story to prove that laughter can turn an ordinary day into an unforgettable one.
445	21269	8	3	"Middle school was a challenging environment. Not only are kids subjected to a rapid advancement in the academic environment, but a maturing social environment as well. The rapidly growing need for social dominance and in turn inflating egos makes for a bully breeding ground. Without the skill to be able to laugh it off, I would fear for anyone's mental well - being in that environment. Throughout my first @NUM1 years in middle school, I struggled with the building social discomfort of classmates higher in the social chain. Their constant teasing and taunting took a severe toll @CAPS1 not only on my self - esteem, but my academics as well. The stress of my own social stature plummeted my grades, continuing a vicious cycle resulting in even more stress. The whole situation seemed hopeless and depressing. I could not believe that in only a little over a decade of life, my outlook had become so grim. I wondered how I would make it through the rest of my school years. Every day I had the ""pleasure"" of hearing any number of new insults made up by those higher in the social ladder, attempting to supplement their growing self - esteem and inflating egos; @CAPS1 some days even those who I previously believed to be my friends joined in with them. Except for a few trusted companions, it seemed the whole world was out to further themselves by bashing me with any number of new insults. Being made fun of daily had continued until I realized something; That laughter is key in social survival. Without laughter there was no way I could have survived those school years. After this revelation, I was able to laugh at things said to me and laugh at myself as well. I was able to take the cacophony of insults and learn with it, taking it as critique to better myself. Through laughter and their jarring remarks, I was able to secure my position in the social scheme as well as improve my intelligence. I also made new, better friends and came to peace with others, while maintaining the hurt I experienced earlier to be ""popular"" without having to make fun out of those who were like who I used to be; @CAPS2 a win - win scenario. Laughter is key in any situation, whether it be a conversation with a friend, or experiencing the pent - up frustrations of immature adolescents. From laughter, I learned a great lesson, one that I hope everyone has or should learn. Without the lesson of laughter, I don't know how anyone could lead a successful and pleasurable life. Laughter truly has the power to turn a negative situation into a positive learning experience."
446	21271	8	3	"They say laughter is the best kind of medicine there is. So, to tell you the truth about that quote, I will tell you a true story about laughter and how it's a medicine. I've already come to believe it myself. I also will explain its key role in the world. To start us off, I'll tell you a story where laughter fixed the tension between my grandpa @CAPS1 and my cousin @PERSON1. It happened sometime during the @DATE1. We were all having a great time. There were my cousins @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and his little brother @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and I. @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were just minding our own business, playing games while our grandpa was watching us. Then, out of nowhere, we heard a loud smack, followed by crying and screaming. It turned out that @PERSON1 ""slipped"" and smacked @PERSON3, who is only seven years old. Our grandpa started yelling and trying to figure out what had happened. After seeing the big red hand mark on @PERSON3's back, grandpa really lost his temper and started going ballistic at @PERSON1. Then @PERSON1 went home, really upset. Later, @PERSON1 came back, and grandpa and I sat at the table talking to him. That's when I said something that made everyone laugh so hard that they forgot what had happened. Then he said sorry to @PERSON3, and we were all happy by the time grandma got home from work. To conclude my story, I want to remind you why laughter is an important element. It was a true story from my life. So, thanks for listening. When you or someone is down or really mad, laughter is the medicine for the job."
447	21272	8	3	"I have heard people say that a smile makes a big difference in a first meeting, a relationship, or just when walking past people on the street. If someone has had a bad @CAPS2, not only should a smile make it better, but also some laughter to accompany that sincere smile. I enjoy walking down the street on a nice, sunny @CAPS2 and passing by locals I know. They smile, laugh, and give a little wave, showing that they are enjoying the @CAPS2 as much as I am. Walking past someone I don't know also has its positives. One look at their face can tell me if they are having a good @CAPS2 or a bad @CAPS2. Either way, I give a smile. A smile to show that it's a good @CAPS2 or a smile of encouragement to let them know it will get better. I enjoy the feeling I get when I meet someone and I know that we connected well. A good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. I now know that I enjoy being around someone like me who loves to smile and laugh. I can't really see myself around a serious person. I know if I was, we would clash and have problems because I am loud, and if they are serious, there would be issues and we wouldn't be able to collaborate on decisions. When I first met my friend @CAPS1, I was nervous and scared because we were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend. It was a @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 double - date with our friend and my cousin. When the guys first picked us up, I got into the car, and the first thing I remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. I ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk. As the date went on, he seemed like a down - to - earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face, and laughter seemed to flow right out of him. As time went on, we became closer than I would have ever thought. I was not sure where our friendship would lead us, but soon after, it became noticeable that he liked me and I liked him. We took it slow, not rushing into things. We had long conversations that would last for hours, and we always seemed to laugh about everything. He made everything seem better each and every time we talked. Having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away. Just the other night, @CAPS1 and @CAPS4, our mutual friend, came over to visit my cousin @PERSON1 and me at her house. We were all laughing and enjoying each other's company when @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 decided to go to the store and buy some things using @CAPS1's car. Since they weren't going to be gone for long, @CAPS1 and I decided to wait inside. Minutes after that, as we sat, talking to each other, @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 ran into the house looking flushed, out of breath, scared, and nervous about something. @CAPS4 wouldn't look at us, so @PERSON1 told us to go outside, saying something had happened to the car. As we stood there, I realized that the car was nowhere in sight in the driveway, so I became suspicious. We asked them where the car was, and they pointed to the road. In the dark, all we could see was the faint outline of a car in the ditch. I was expecting @CAPS1 to get mad and say something to @CAPS4, who seemed not to know what to say. Instead, he smiled, walked towards the car, and said, ""@CAPS11't worry, the car is fine."" When he said that, he started laughing, his amazing laugh. I was still in a state of shock, so when I heard that laugh of his, I turned and looked at him. Realizing that he was happy and didn't seem to mind the accident, I began laughing as well. In less than @NUM1 seconds of him beginning to laugh, not only were we four laughing, but also two of my other cousins who had joined us outside. Laughter made the situation better, and I enjoyed the fact that we could all laugh about the smallest, the unexpected, and the worst as well as the best. What also made me happy was the fact that that very same night after the incident, @CAPS1 asked me the question I was hoping to hear, and the way he said it made me laugh, which then caused him to laugh. I answered his question with a hug and a yes, and he brought out a bouquet of roses. As we walked inside, my cousins and my aunt started to applaud, and we all started to laugh with smiles on our faces."
448	21273	8	3	Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of that is true. Laughter is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life, laughter has helped me through the hardest situations and made them a lot better. You can laugh a lot with friends, family, or people you barely even know. Laughing can mend relationships and help you get through anything. I've found that out many times in my life. My mother and I haven't always had the best relationship. We don't always get along, and since I have a severe separation anxiety from her, we spend a lot of time together, which can cause friction. There was a certain time when we had a fight. I wanted to go somewhere, and she didn't let me. I was expecting her to be mad at me for a while because of how rude I was being. We didn't talk for a couple of hours and tried to stay away from each other. We would only talk if it was really important. After a couple of days of this, I went into her room to talk to her about it. When we talked, I understood why she was so mad at me, and I apologized and left her room. But I could still feel that there was some tension between us. I wanted to make things better more than anything. I wasn't really sure if she was ready to get over this fight, so I thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day, trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about. The next day, we went to do some things around town, like grocery shopping and visiting some family. In the beginning, we didn't really talk much. Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together, we started joking around and laughing at everything each other said. After our errands, we went out to lunch. It was the most fun I've ever had with my mom. We talked about everything, laughed, and had an amazing time. The days after that were wonderful too. We spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other. I know that laughing together and talking really helped. We opened up to each other like we never had before. I love my mother and care for her more than anyone in the world. When we got into that fight, I was scared our relationship would never be the same again. But we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly think that laughter can cure anything, from a broken heart to a broken family.
449	21274	8	3	"Laughter is important in many ways. It can help you solve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help in awkward situations. All relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in a while. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be many more feuds. One instance where laughter helped was when my best friend, @PERSON1, and I were in a big fight about someone spilling paint on a pair of shorts she owned. We were both accusing one another, and the situation was getting worse. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @PERSON1 made a funny face that made me laugh. Once I laughed, I could tell she wasn't amused. She began questioning why I was laughing. So I explained to her, and she ran to the bathroom and, looking into the mirror, made the same face. To my surprise, she started laughing too. After a ten - minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splatter them with paint for a rather ""unique"" look. Needless to say, laughing saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, they probably don't feel good physically. They might feel angry for days, which can give them physical pain. I know for me, if I'm angry long enough, I'll get a headache. Ironically, I get more angry at people around me because my head hurts and they're making it worse. Laughing is a way to change things. Not necessarily being carefree, but learning to let go and live. Physical health is greatly affected by laughter, as well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning to not worry about the small stuff is really important. My favorite thing to hear is ""let go laughing."" Letting go of a problem while laughing is the best way to get rid of problems. I've also noticed that when you laugh more, you feel better overall. You have more energy, usually because of the endorphins that kick in when you have a crazy fit of laughter. It also lightens the mood a lot when you're with other people. All people need to laugh, whether they're married couples, students, teachers, or best friends. Laughing can bring people together. In the end, laughing can benefit you in many ways. It can help resolve feuds, lighten moods, and have good effects on your mental and physical health. And the best thing to always remember is to let go laughing."
450	21275	8	3	"There is nothing more fun than going to a friend's house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a rough message that touches your heart. In fact, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like you are. Which for my story, could be interpreted as a bad thing, but for me it is nothing but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest times together, and the funny thing is we don't have to be doing anything illegal! It's such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching Vampire @CAPS2, and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? Too much. Let me tell you of some things that have happened to my lovely friend and me. First, like always, there is a @DATE1, and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. It's a very short walk. I leave my church at twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, at her door, and I open it. Bark bark bark! ""@CAPS3 up, @PERSON1,"" @CAPS4 yells from another room. The snowzer pup comes to greet me. He should know better. The one dog eats rocks for goodness sakes. But on @DATE2, @CAPS15 has her reasons to yell and be a little grouchy. ""I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if she knows you're here and they are not done."" ""@CAPS6't worry, I'll help you, and we'll get them done before your sister notices."" Then, we are off. @CAPS4 wanders the house frantically, looking for dishes and putting them in the sink. Meanwhile, I work on putting the clean ones away in the dishwasher. We hear a sound from her sister's room, and we jump. @CAPS4's sister sounds like she is waking up, but then she snorts and the noise ends. Then we get back to work. When we got done, we slumped onto the couch and looked at each other. We were tired and our hearts were still pounding. Then, her sister snorts again. We laugh hysterically, and her sister"
451	21276	8	3	"@PERSON1, @CAPS1, wake up! It's almost time for you to go to school!"" @CAPS2's mom yelled at the boy with fuzzy hair, half - opened eyes, and a yawning mouth. That's me. Today is the first day of @CAPS2's first new middle school. Our family moved to a new place, so that's why I had to change schools too. I woke up, took a quick shower, and put on @CAPS2's school uniforms with an excited yet nervous mind, as I didn't know anyone from @CAPS6's new school. When I arrived at the school, students of the same age as me started to scream out loud, either due to the sadness of the upcoming school days or the excitement of meeting their friends again. On the other hand, I was depressed and confused because of these hyper students and the new school environment. I shook @CAPS2's head to clear my thoughts and started to focus on finding @CAPS2's classroom. '@CAPS3, hah! There it is.' @CAPS4, I found @CAPS2's classroom and when I stepped in, @CAPS5 looked at me curiously for a while, since I was the ""new"" kid at @CAPS6's school. I sat alone and waited for the teacher to come. While I was waiting, I put @CAPS2's head down and dozed off a little, with no smile on @CAPS2's face. Suddenly, the teacher opened the door and spoke loudly, ""@CAPS5, sit down and be quiet!"" @CAPS6's teacher must be the strictest teacher I've ever seen. While the teacher was writing something on the whiteboard, the students were whispering and trash - talking about their first impression of the teacher. It was terrible to yell at the students upon first sight. For example, I knew a kid who transferred from a private school to a public school. I was in the same class with him and we were partners. Since I didn't know him very well at first, I started to ask him some questions. At first, he answered me nicely and I thought, 'We could become close friends in @CAPS6's class.' @CAPS7, it turned out to be wrong. He started to talk loudly to me when the teacher was explaining something, which got me into trouble for talking with him. Other students disliked him for being a distraction during class, and he often asked useless questions to the teacher in a very loud voice. Also, he had a really weird perfume smell that he thought was cool. @CAPS5 thought he was annoying, which led to a small fight. @CAPS8 after arguing with other friends, he stopped coming to school and now we don't even know where he is. Like @CAPS6's situation, it shows that the first impression is really important in building relationships with other people. When I heard from the students sitting behind me that the first impression is crucial, it changed @CAPS2's mindset to a more open one, like having a smile on @CAPS2's face. I thought, 'I shouldn't give that kind of first impression like that teacher. Maybe I should change my expression to a smiling and confident one.' @CAPS8 after that class, I started to put a smile on @CAPS2's face and think positively. I tried to actively participate in the class and worked hard to make new friends in the new school. As a result, the other students also opened up and started to ask me questions. For example, they asked, 'Why did you come to @CAPS6's school?', 'What sports do you like the most?', 'What games do you play?', and so on. From those friendly questions, laughter can transform @CAPS2's appearance and help build good relationships. How do I know? When I first entered @CAPS2's classroom with a worried face, @CAPS5 just stared at me and seemed uninterested in getting to know me. @CAPS8 after I started putting on a smile, they started to feel more comfortable around me than the first time. Changing my depressed face was @CAPS2's starting point in the new school. I began to make a lot of friends, which eventually led me to become the class leader. I felt really amazing and proud that ""the new guy"" could be the leader of @CAPS6's class. I was proud of myself and realized the happiness that came with having a smile on @CAPS2's face, as the teacher didn't seem approachable without a smile.  You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well, I would have to agree to that because when I'm at school, I would laugh all day long whenever I saw my friend named @PERSON1. We would have a great time all day long, just the three of us in mostly the same two classes. We would laugh in the halls and in the classrooms, sometimes at each other and sometimes at people we didn't even know. I always loved going to school last year, but this year isn't as much fun because @PERSON1 moved to the @CAPS1 - es and I don't know where she lives now. After @PERSON1 left, I really miss the good old days with her. It's a pity that we aren't going to the same schools anymore or that she isn't coming to school with us. Now it's just @LOCATION1 and me, and we hardly have as much fun in class without her, but most of the days we still manage to have some fun. I remember when @PERSON1 first came to this school, she looked like the other girls in our class. But once we got to know her, we became best friends. The next day, she thought we wouldn't like her because she was a new kid at the school. But we got to know her very well as we would hang out with each other since back in the seventh grade. The thing that I always loved about @PERSON1 is that she could turn anyone having a bad day into a really good one. She would always do kind things like that. However, there were some days when she was feeling down and blue, and @PERSON2 and I would try to cheer her up, but she would just get mad at us because she felt we weren't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that, but we are friends and friends are supposed to be there for each other no matter what. The next day, she wouldn't remember what had happened the previous day because she often forgot things when she was really angry at someone. One time in one of my classes, there weren't many students in the class. We were painting, and @PERSON1 and I were working on a bulletin board. The colors were white and brown, and we kind of got the paint all over the place and on each other. I painted half of her hand brown and the other side white, and she got some of the paint on the paper we were using to let it dry so we could paint again, but that didn't work out well because we had to go to our next class. The next day in that same class, we almost did the same thing. We got the paint on the floor, the sink, the soap dispenser, and on each other. We even drew a little something on each other. I drew a heart with her name in it; her name was in pen and the heart was in paint. In our next class, we laughed for the rest of the day. We even got my sister @LOCATION1 to laugh with us, even though it wasn't that funny because we had eaten a lot of candy, and candy always made us laugh. These are the days that I'll always remember because @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and I were always laughing and always found something to talk about. Out of all the times I've laughed, the most fun ones were with my friend @PERSON1 because we had so much fun together. She was the one who held us all together. I think when all of us were together, we were always laughing every moment of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do, we would laugh all the time. In one of our classes during fifth period, we would say ""like"" all the time because we were the only two girls in the class with four boys and a male teacher. So @PERSON1 and I would do all sorts of things in that class, but we made sure not to do anything that would get us in trouble.  @DATE2, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was an extremely warm day, and @CAPS3 and I were on our way to my family reunion in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2. Our car was packed to the brim with my mom, grandma, cousin, and the two of us girls, so @CAPS2 got incredibly hot. @CAPS2 was around the @NUM1 of @DATE1, in @DATE3. I seriously thought we were all going to suffocate in that car! We had the air - conditioning on full blast, but it didn't help much. I was squeezed in the middle of my cousin, @CAPS4, and @CAPS3. We finally reached a rest stop, and we all kind of staggered out of the car like zombies. @CAPS3 said she wanted to go get a drink, so I tagged along. I'm pretty sure we were getting strange looks from all the people around us at that point. I was wearing my @LOCATION1 @CAPS6's, and @CAPS3 was in @CAPS8 @CAPS9. It felt like it took @NUM2 excruciating minutes just to walk to the drinking fountain. It was really that sweltering. I opened a cliff bar while @CAPS3 was getting a drink. That's when I heard her let out a scream. Of course, I burst out laughing, even though I had no idea what had happened. @CAPS3 turned around, and my laughter quickly turned into hysterical screaming on my part. The spout on the fountain had been adjusted so that the water sprayed directly at you when you tried to drink, and @CAPS3 was completely soaked from head to toe. I said sarcastically, ""@CAPS12, you won't be hot for a while now, will ya?"" We both laughed uncontrollably, and then she chased me around, trying to get me wet too. Sometimes, all you can do in such situations is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally arrived at the family reunion, they had a pool. She tried to push me in, but I managed to pull her in with me. Everyone around was laughing at that point. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard as I did last @DATE2. Those were truly unforgettable and wonderful times.  Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is a very essential thing in life. I personally couldn't imagine living without laughter. I genuinely mean it; I wouldn't be myself without it. All relationships should have an element of laughter. What would a relationship be like without laughter? Laughter is a truly beautiful thing. When I'm laughing, I'm enjoying life in my own unique way, and all my worries seem to vanish instantly. I feel like I'm ""carefree."" Laughter is beneficial for our health, both physically and mentally. Throughout my life, there have been numerous instances where laughter has played a significant role in my relationships. But let me tell you about a particular time when laughter really stood out and remains a huge part of my relationship with my dad. I've always been extremely close to my dad. You might even say I'm a daddy's little girl. Laughter has always had a special place in our relationship. It has a way of sneaking into every moment we share. The @CAPS1 times filled with laughter are the ones I cherish the most. Whenever I think about them, I can't help but smile. I remember when I was a little girl, if I ever needed a good laugh, my dad was the first person I'd turn to. As the years went by, our shared laughter grew even stronger. I can't recall a single moment when my dad and I didn't share a laugh. We used to watch these @CAPS3 comedy shows together. We'd laugh so hard that it was almost impossible to get through an episode without making noise or missing something. We'd laugh so loudly that we'd wake up the whole family. Sometimes, we didn't even know what was so funny; the laughter would just bubble up naturally. I can still hear the sweet sound of our laughter echoing in my ears. Oh, how I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights. They were the highlight of my week. I knew that soon, I'd be laughing side - by - side with my dad, and tears of joy would stream down our faces. I looked forward to that beautiful sound of laughter. It was nearly impossible to watch an entire show without bursting into laughter. Oh, what @CAPS1 wonderful times those were. Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1, we haven't had those precious moments of laughter that I long for so much. But I can always hold them close to my heart. Those moments of laughter were the best I've ever had with my dad, from when I was a little girl to now, on the verge of becoming an adult. I don't think my dad and I would be as close as we are today if it weren't for all the laughter we've shared throughout our lives. Whenever I'm sad or miss my dad, I revisit those memories filled with laughter and can almost hear his laugh in my mind. I never realized how important laughter would be to me. I'm so glad that laughter has played such a vital role in my life. Laughter is an indispensable part of life and relationships because it brings joy and happiness. No matter what, laughter should always be a part of any relationship. I believe laughter is good for our well - being. For example, if you're feeling sad, depressed, or just having a bad day, a good laugh can turn things around, just like it did for my dad and me. Laughter also helps relationships last longer."

I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because @PERSON1 moved into the @CAPS1-es and I don't know where she lives now but after @PERSON1 left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us @LOCATION1 and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do.

The thing that i always love about @PERSON1 is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and @PERSON2 and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we wasn't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterday because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone. one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting and me and @PERSON1 was painting bulletin board. the colors was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go yo our next class.

Out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend @PERSON1 because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together. I think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do we would laugh all that time. This one we would say ""like"" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so @PERSON1 and me would do almost anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in troble."

454	21280	8	3	"Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 For the @ORGANIZATION1 is a very important thing in life , I personally could not live without laughter in my life I honestly could not do it. I would not be me if I didn't have laughter in my life . All relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter! Laughter is a beautiful thing , when I am laughing I am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how I feel like I am ""carefree "" . Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . Through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . But let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   I have always been very close to my dad , you might even say I am a daddy's little girl .Laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. It somehow always found its way into our relationship. The @CAPS1 times of laughter are what I valued and treasured so much that whenever I think about it I cant help but smile . I remember when I was little if I ever needed a @CAPS1 laugh my dad was the person to call . The laughter grew stronger through out the years , I cannot recall a time where my dad and I had a moment where laughter was not involved . We always used to watch these @CAPS3 shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .We would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . I can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and I oh how I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights were what I looked forward to, I knew that I would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . I looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @CAPS1 times those were . Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1 ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that I miss so much, but I can always treasure them in my heart. Those moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my dad,since I was little girl till now almost an adult . I don't know if my dad and I would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. Whenever I am sad or miss my dad , I go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @CAPS1 day a @CAPS1 laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and I. Laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why I am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . If laughter was not involved in my relationships , I could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. My dad is the reason why I laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. I never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  Where I would be today without laughter I truly have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! I certainly cant imagine life without laughter. If my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. What do you think about laughter? Has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?  "
455	21281	8	3	"Laughter: The @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 Laughter, they say, is the best medicine. We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, ""yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine! "
456	21284	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @ORGANIZATION1 is like a magical bridge, the shortest distance between two people. They express pure happiness, a deep sense of belonging, and they let you forget your worries for a few precious seconds. Who does not like to laugh? It's a universal language of joy. I will be writing a true story in which laughter will be one important part. My story will be about myself, who is an exchange student and @CAPS1 in high school, and how I got to know my today's best friend. It all started in the early morning of my first day in a @CAPS1 high school. I remember clearly how nervous and excited I was. I was not able to focus on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions. How is the school going to look like? And what are the students going to think about me? I have never been in the @LOCATION1 before and I have never been an exchange student. Because of all the worries, which were running through my mind, I did not even notice that it was already time to leave the house. This moment which I have been envisioning for months, finally arrived. My host - mom said good - bye to me and wished me a great day. Now I was totally by myself. I walked into the high school and went to my first class: @CAPS3. On the way to the classroom, people stared at me, but nobody said a word. Have you ever felt like you are alone even though hundreds of people are around you? This is exactly the way I felt in that moment. My first class went well, as well as my second class: @CAPS4. During @CAPS4, some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. Although this question seemed really stupid to me, I answered nicely with yes. My next period was drama. I had trouble finding the drama room, but luckily I met a girl on the way who showed me where I was supposed to go. Her name was @PERSON1 and she told me that she moved here last year from @LOCATION3. From the first moment I saw her, she seemed really nice to me. On the way to the classroom, she asked me questions about the difference of @LOCATION2 and the @LOCATION1. She also appeared quite interested in me. While our drama teacher was preparing a scene, we continued talking. I had the strange feeling that I have known her forever. The whole nervousness I had at the beginning of the day was gone. I told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. She answered that they asked her the exact same question, but about @LOCATION3. Suddenly, she started to laugh. It was a happy and friendly laugh and soon I started to laugh as well. It did not feel awkward for me, sitting next to a girl I just met and we were laughing so hard. I knew that this moment, this laughter was special. I felt so happy and belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds. What I did not know in this moment, though, was that she will become my best friend. This was my true story, in which laughter was an important part. It is not easy to be @CAPS1 in school, especially if you are an exchange student. My story showed that a laughter is able to change people's thoughts and to shorten the distance between two people. In my case, it made me feel more comfortable and confident, which was the start of a great relationship, as well as an awesome time in the @LOCATION1. The end.
457	21285	8	3	"High school years are tough for many teenagers, especially if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times. I had a great friend named @PERSON1. She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what. We stopped being each other's friends around the end of our sophomore year. It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a close. It wasn't like we made enemies with each other. But we didn't end our friendship so nice and peacefully. On the @DATE1 going into my junior year, I had forgotten why we weren't friends anymore. If I didn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously it was a stupid thing to fight about. But things were said to one another. So it would be a lot harder to make - up. I really didn't want to be the one to apologize first. I did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that. It was the first day of my junior year. I hadn't seen one sign of @PERSON1 anywhere. It worried me because I thought she might have moved away and I didn't get the chance to say good - bye to her. Lunch had passed and that is when I mostly saw everyone. And there was still no sign of her anywhere. As I walked to my last class of the day, I was seated in the front row. Once I was settled, there walked in @LOCATION1. I had a little smirk on my face knowing she was still here and she hadn't moved away. She turned to look at me with a serious look. For that one second I had forgotten we weren't friends. My face became serious as well. It was great knowing she was still living here, but horrible knowing we still hadn't made peace with each other. But I didn't want to be the one to apologize first, because I knew she would think I was the one to blame. So leaving it like that was all I could think of. The semester went by really fast. Seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there. I lost a really good friend from something I don't even remember. I've noticed she's made new friends and has moved on with our friendship. She still once in a while hung out with my group of friends. When we both joined cheerleading we saw each other more after school. But we still didn't talk. It really felt like she was acting as if I never was a part of her life. At first I hated her for treating me that way. But I also had to take responsibility for what I had done to her. One night I felt so out of it. I really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my face. The only person that came to mind was @PERSON1. I felt very alone at that time. So I decided to write her an e - mail. It would have been better to have said it to her face but I know I would have chickened out if I did it face to face. So an e - mail was better than nothing. I told her I was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth. I told her how much I missed her friendship and how much I missed her presence around me. I woke up the next morning feeling very sick to my stomach. I didn't want to go to school but I did anyways. During lunch time I sat at my usual place in the hall. @PERSON1 came out of nowhere and sat next to me. She smiled and said ""remember when you tripped in the @NUM1 grade?"" I could not stop laughing when she said that. Tears came down my face for how hard I was laughing. It felt like it's been forever since I laughed that hard. We talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives. We laughed more than we talked. I really had my funny best friend back. And the laughs can go on again."
458	21286	8	3	Laughter is an important part of life. It is important in my life because it makes me truly happy. I am going to tell a true story about why laughter is so important to me and to my life. On days that I would be sad because of some stressful and unhappy things that were happening in my life at the moment, my friend @CAPS1 would come to my house to cheer me up. He would cheer me up by making me laugh, a great deal. The main ways that he could make me laugh, when he would notice that I am sad were, tickling me randomly quite a lot, saying a funny joke or asking me a silly question and by making me play a video game or two, that I was very embarrassingly bad at. The first way he can get me to laugh is by tickling me. When he would come over we would just sit around and talk about random stuff that popped into our heads. He would notice me getting sad at some point and he would say that if I didn't cheer up he would tickle me so that I laughed to get cheered up. I wouldn't really cheer up right away so that he could make me laugh to cheer me up. So, he would start to tickle me vigorously. I am ticklish basically everywhere, so I would laugh hysterically and it was so much fun. After he would finally stop tickling me, I would still be laughing. If I were to get sad again, he would just keep on tickling me until he was sure that I was happy. I would get happy that day because of laughter. Another day that he was over just hanging out with me. I might not have been having that great of a day. We would be watching a movie and eating popcorn or watching TV, and he would notice that I wasn't really that happy. So, he would try and make me laugh to cheer me up. He would get me to laugh by saying some funny silly joke or asking me a weird random question. Little funny things like that will always make me laugh. Throughout the day or while watching the movie, he would say something like it is so nice outside when it really wasn't, he was just making me laugh. Or, something in the movie would happen and he would say how that would never be possible in real life. He would just get me to laugh to cheer me up. In addition to tickling me and saying something funny to make me laugh, he would also make me play a video game to get my mind off things. At his house one time he said that we should play some fun video games for something to do, because it would be rainy outside. At first he would show me how good he is at one of his favorite video games, like Assassins @CAPS2. Then he would say that I should try to play it. I was not very good at it but it was fun. I am not used to the controls of an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 so I wouldn't know how to do some things, and he would make fun of me for it because it was actually supposed to be easy. When I couldn't do something I would laugh about it and give the controller to him because I couldn't do it and he could. That would make me laugh because I couldn't do something simple like run up a wall in the game, so, I would have to give it to him to do and that was funny to us. Being bad at video games is funny to me and it makes me laugh. In turn that would make me happy which is important. In conclusion, by my friend @CAPS1 tickling me a lot, saying something weird and random, that is silly and funny or, by getting me to play video games that I was bad at and had to have him do it for me, would make me laugh. By him making me laugh, a lot, it made me very happy. Laughing is a very important part of my life and this story. It is important because if I didn't laugh as much as he makes me, I would not be as happy. If I am not happy, that isn't a good thing. Because, being happy is a very important part of any life and relationship. Most of the ways I can get happy are by laughing. So, this story shows that laughing is a very important part of my life. You could also say that it is important in my relationship with @CAPS1. He makes me laugh which makes me happy. That is very important to me.
459	21287	8	3	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. For the longest time I never thought that I could be happy. I felt as if every time I tried, someone was always there to say ""@CAPS1 no, she's about to be happy. Better take everything away from her."" That's exactly what always happened; I was the one being dumped, cheated on, or losing a best friend. I would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand. I didn't think that wish would come true, but somehow it did. @PERSON2 was the type of guy you could tell anything to. He would listen and care as if it was his problem also. That's what attracted me most to him. His sense of knowing when things weren't right and attempting to make them better. The thing I loved most about him was how he could make me happy when I felt so down. He didn't live close to me, he never came over and we barely knew each other but he made me smile better than anyone I've known for years. I guess I never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It didn't take long for that to be proven wrong. Freshman year and I was lost. I just wanted to be popular, make friends and get a good boyfriend. My main focus that drove me through each class period was boys. It wasn't the best thing I could have focused on but hey, they got me through. I still remember sitting in my math class when a tall boy with brown - blond hair sat in the front row. @PERSON2 was his name, and I suddenly became attached. I did what most girls do when they see a cute guy. Made a fool of myself. I was so sure that I was never going to get a chance with him until I got his number. The story goes on from there, we dated and dumped. For a while we didn't talk. But that's what made us bond even more. We later became best friends, and that is how I became happy. My boyfriend, was not a good boyfriend at all. It took me a while to realize this because I was entranced by his ability"
460	21288	8	3	"Sometimes, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 I glanced around nervously as much mother drove up to the strange and unfamiliar building that was to be @CAPS6 new @ORGANIZATION2. ""@CAPS5 around! We can come back another time...or @CAPS2 not come back at all."" @CAPS6 mother laughed and continued to search for a parking spot. I slumped down in @CAPS6 seat, discouraged and lonely. @DATE1 was the first day of @CAPS6 sophomore year in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2, and I had to spend it at a new @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2; @ORGANIZATION1. Transferring to a new @ORGANIZATION2 would not @CAPS3 been so bad if I hadn't been forced to leave the @ORGANIZATION2 I loved, the @ORGANIZATION2 I had friends in, the @ORGANIZATION2 which met @CAPS6 selective needs and wants. I was dreading this day and only wished I could go home and sleep this vivid nightmare away.  @CAPS6 mom had to practically drag me from our minivan to the @ORGANIZATION2 doors, for both @CAPS6 body and mind were aching to run in the opposite direction. There was a massive crowd of students swarming around the room, which would later be known to me as ""the commons."" @CAPS6 mom introduced me to the woman in charge, @PERSON3, then waved goodbye and headed back to the car. I felt nauseous, and @CAPS6 heart was pounding as I glanced around at @CAPS6 new peers. I did not see even one familiar or friendly face. Not being an outgoing person was a struggle for me, especially when I was faced with new surroundings, such as this @ORGANIZATION2. The truth was, I didn't even want to make any friends. I @CAPS2 wanted to go back to @ORGANIZATION2;@CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION2.  As the day progressed, @CAPS6 mood only got worse. No one had even tried to be nice to me, and I wasn't really trying either. As the students were taking a field trip down to the @CAPS9 campus down the street, I ran into a girl who looked @CAPS2 as uncomfortable as I did. @CAPS14 had long, blond, straight hair, brown eyes, and a pierced nose. We started walking together, our steps in sync with each other, although no words were exchanged. We both @CAPS2 felt more comfortable standing next to each other, rather than standing alone. At the @CAPS9 campus, I decided to abandon @CAPS6 timid, protective shell, and I asked her where @CAPS14 was from. ""@LOCATION1,"" @CAPS14 replied. ""@CAPS6 family moved here last @DATE2, so I was home schooled until the end of the year,"" @CAPS14 informed me, her voice laced with nervousness. We continued to make small talk as our group took a tour through the building. I still had not learned her name though because I couldn't read the handwriting on her name tag, and I was too embarrassed to ask what it was. Fortunately @CAPS14 started talking about her name. ""@CAPS6 parents named me @PERSON1 because @CAPS6 mom is @CAPS13, and I guess @CAPS14 really liked that name."" @CAPS14 shrugged and rolled her eyes. @CAPS14 told me I could call her by her nickname, @PERSON2, because @CAPS14 didn't like people talking to her using her full name.  After our tour, all the groups of students headed back to the @ORGANIZATION2, for we were going to @CAPS3 a pizza party for lunch. As @PERSON2 and I sat in the corner munching on our food, we studied the kids around us. ""@CAPS15...This is going to be the worst year ever,"" I said gloomily. We stared pitifully at each other for a moment, sizing up the difficult times ahead of us. Then, simultaneously, we both cracked a smile. Next thing I knew, we were laughing hysterically, our bodies rocking back and forth with every breathe that managed to escape our lips.  Sometimes, when life throws me lemons, instead of making lemonade, I pucker up @CAPS6 lips at the thought of how sour they are, and I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to @CAPS4. Although laughing did not automatically make @CAPS6 new @ORGANIZATION2 a fun and welcoming place, it made it @CAPS2 a little more bearable. Laughter truly is the best medicine, no matter what the illness or problem is, and it can make two strangers into friends almost immediately."
461	21289	8	3	"I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a proper classroom, or even from a well - written book. I learned this important lesson in a somewhat quiet hallway near the busy copy room. One might be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon. In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third - period class; which was leadership at that time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice might give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the classroom in order to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership directly preceded my least favorite class of the day, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I simply detested that class. I had been in @CAPS1 classes ever since I was in kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION1. I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for @CAPS1 class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot. She was that type of person who had @CAPS10 proper posture and was a stickler for the rules. The kind of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon. In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long - winded. He could take the entire @NUM1 - minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do. That day however, we weren't doing an assignment. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment. Another girl from the class, @CAPS5; and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited patiently for the teacher to finish talking and then asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the @CAPS6 hall, and the library. Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was in my @CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year. He replied with a no. I told him, ""@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!"" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while. Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking. After I had said bye to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter. I was taken - aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. It was right then that @LOCATION1, my @CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, ""@PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!"" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to @LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class."
462	21290	8	3	"Laughter is a crucial element of @CAPS1. Laughter is a huge and essential element of @CAPS1. Without laughter, @CAPS1 wouldn't be what it is today. Laughing is actually an important element of why I am in my relationship with my boyfriend as of right now. I also believe, as someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter also effectively breaks the ice with people, whether they're mad, sad, or just meeting someone new. Also, laughter can bring two people very close together. Here is a true story about how laughter is a key element of @CAPS1. One day while I was with my best friend @PERSON1, we met up with her cousin @CAPS2 friend's @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and I started talking and hanging out a lot that night. I'm a very shy person but he kept making me laugh. This is no love story but his making me laugh broke the wall I had put up because I was shy and very uncomfortable. The more we laughed together, the closer I felt to him and the more comfortable I was around him. Eventually, we started dating. To this day, we are still together and we have a very strong relationship because of laughter. If it wasn't for the laughter, @PERSON2 and I would not be as close as we are now. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I firmly believe that because laughter gives you that feeling of security, like the sense that it is okay to be yourself around strangers. Laughing makes you feel warm and invited to have fun. It makes you feel like at this moment you're bonding with this person. It doesn't make you feel uncomfortable when using laughter for the right reason, for example, breaking the ice with someone or just meeting someone that can bring them closer. Breaking the ice with laughter. Meeting someone for the first time can be very uncomfortable for some people. Making conversation and laughing could do the trick to make them feel not so shy and more at ease to start talking. When I first meet people, I am very shy until someone makes me laugh, then I am very comfortable. Sometimes making people laugh when they are sad or mad could also bring you very close with someone. But laughter could always push you away from someone. When I was upset about me and my ex - fiance breaking up for the first time after a year and a half, no one for a day or two could make me happy. My best friend @PERSON1 brought me out to the state fair. Being on the rides and laughing with her brought her and I closer, and also I was not mad anymore. She broke that anger and hurt inside of me just by laughing. A huge element of @CAPS1 is laughter, there is no doubt about that. Depending on the person's perspective, laughing might not be an element of @CAPS1 to them, but to me it is. Without the feeling of security when laughing with @PERSON2, we wouldn't be as close as we are now. Without laughter, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't feel as warm and comfortable as we are together. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Someone once said. @CAPS1 would be a whole lot different without this element of laughter."
463	21291	8	3	"My friend @ORGANIZATION2 received a random phone call in the @TIME1. It was his friends from high school, and there were three of them. The weird thing about that is they haven't talked much since high school. Surprised, @ORGANIZATION2 asked what was going on and how they were doing, assuming they were in jail or something of that sort. Instead, the friends replied and told him how they were doing and then told @ORGANIZATION2 they wanted to go on a road trip. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to himself ""why the heck are you telling me about this"", and then said cool. He asked, ""what do you need from me?"" The friend replied saying he needed @ORGANIZATION2 to plan the trip because they did not have computers and they couldn't read maps. A week and a half went by later, @ORGANIZATION2 called his friends back to tell them the plans. Proudly he said after his hard work of planning for them, ""It's a ten - day trip for you guys starting in @LOCATION1 then driving down to @LOCATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 and on the way down and back hit up (watch) a game from all five of the professional baseball teams down in @LOCATION2, then go to six flags, another amusement park like @ORGANIZATION1."" The friends replied, ""what do you mean you guys? You are coming with us."" @ORGANIZATION2 was super surprised and told them, ""You guys haven't talked to me in about five years and then you randomly want to go on a road trip with me,"" he said sounding kind of confused. The friends replied, ""well we need your car and we don't know how to drive and again we don't know how to read maps."" Thinking hard about the situation, @ORGANIZATION2 finally caved in and told them yes, but then gave conditions. He split up tasks for his friends so he wouldn't be stuck with all of the work. For example, he gave one of the guys the task of finding hotels and places to stay, another was finding gas stations, and the other friend had to find all the restaurants they were going to eat at. The trip had started and for @ORGANIZATION2 the vacation was much needed and unexpectedly fun and relaxing. At least for now. Everything was going through and working according to plan. They hit up and joyfully watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time. Then @ORGANIZATION1 land went above and beyond expectation, and even six flags was exciting and brought @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends back to feeling like they were in the good old high school days. The only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone. The friend had the nights when they stayed at a relative's or friend's place mostly set up. But for the hotels, they were kind of last - minute. The last few days before heading back, plans were still going accordingly. They just had one more event, the giants baseball game, then stay with their old high school buddy who moved down to @LOCATION2. Making sure they would have a place to stay for sure, @ORGANIZATION2 asked the friend in charge of finding places to stay. The friend replied with a ""no, I haven't talked to him yet. I will call him later."" This made @ORGANIZATION2 a little uneasy, so he told his friend, ""no, call him now."" The friend did. Their other friend picked up to bring bad news; he was back in @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to himself, ""I knew this trip was too good to be true."" On the @TIME1 of the baseball game, things felt rushed. @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends had to leave really early because the traffic in @LOCATION2 is so random and bad. Meanwhile, @ORGANIZATION2 forgot to use the restroom and two hours into the trip to the giants game, things started to take a bad turn. @ORGANIZATION2 had to go bad. But his friends kept him going, saying the traffic is good and we need to keep going, which @ORGANIZATION2 listened to and kept going. Then traffic came to a standstill. @ORGANIZATION2 was going to go in his pants! So he pulled off and drove down the side of the highway. Surprised he didn't get pulled over, he miraculously ended up at giants stadium. Then he saw a portable potty, he pulled over and raced to it, but it was locked. @ORGANIZATION2 looked around and saw another one. He took off as fast as he could for it. And yes, it was open. Finally, @ORGANIZATION2 thought to himself ecstatically! He stepped inside but then looking at the urinal he realizes he didn't get there fast enough and embarrassingly he went in his pants."
464	21292	8	3	Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke is told, to reminisce about a fond memory, or to clear one's head and create the feeling of calmness. In @DATE1's opinion, laughter is a form of communication. I discovered this through the course of @DATE1 through many different situations. Many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who I was able to connect with through laughter. One of @DATE1's experiences with laughter has been with the many different exchange students that @DATE1's family has hosted. We have gotten exchange students from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION4. Most of them have rather good broken @CAPS1, but there were some words that proved difficult to describe and translate. @DATE1's favorite exchange student was @PERSON1, a student from @LOCATION3. She lives in the northern part of the @LOCATION3, in the @LOCATION2 country. In the @LOCATION2 country, they speak @CAPS2 and the @LOCATION2 culture is slightly different from the rest of @LOCATION3. What made @PERSON1 so enjoyable was her cheerful
465	21293	8	3	"What's a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Laughter?  Would me and @PERSON1 be best friends @CAPS2 ever laughing? That would be a negative. I honestly think laughter is the biggest part of @CAPS1. What kind of @CAPS1 is two friends who never laugh? If there are any people in the world that don't laugh, I bet they don't have any friends, well at least true friends. I feel sorry for these people. I can't even imagine life @CAPS2 laughter. All of my friends and I laugh all the time. Especially with me and @PERSON1. When @PERSON1 and I are around each other, @CAPS5's usually non stop laughter. @PERSON1 and I laugh about almost everything. We have so many inside jokes its not even funny (well to me and her @CAPS5 is), such as ""an upstairs @CAPS3 @CAPS4!"" or ""john, john, john, john"". See there things people wouldn't think where funny, but whenever one of us blurts one of our stupid inside jokes out, we start laughing until we ball our eyes out. If I imagine me and @PERSON1 never laughing, then that would be the worst @CAPS1. I hate to even think about us never laughing. @CAPS5 sounds horrible. If me and @PERSON1 never laughed, then we most likely would not be friends. I'm so glad I have so much laughter in my life. I don't know what I would do @CAPS2 @CAPS5."
466	21294	8	3	@ORGANIZATION1, when you think of a relationship, what exactly comes to mind? Do you believe that laughter is a significant element in a relationship? Here, laughter refers to the sounds of merriment or derision. Many people have experienced relationships, ranging from excellent to bad. When they were @ORGANIZATION1 laughing with each other, they genuinely enjoyed the pleasure derived from one another. First of all, when a couple is laughing, they relish being in each other's company, which makes them eager to spend more time together. Laughter, on its own, allows the couple to develop a better bond. The couple would also achieve a stronger connection. Thus, they would be able to understand each other better. For example, when a couple is out having a great time, they would want to keep sharing this wonderful bond with each other. Another reason why laughter is an element of a relationship is that it will ultimately enable the couple to have a stronger relationship because they would have a remarkable connection and, therefore, be able to understand each other. Consequently, things between them would lead to a stronger and better relationship. Next time you are in a relationship, think about how laughter is an element and how enjoyment, connection, more time together, and a stronger relationship are all somehow benefits just from laughter. So, the next time you are laughing with your boyfriend or girlfriend, think about what you guys are gaining from just laughing with one another. It truly makes a relationship more fulfilling.
467	21295	8	3	"It has been said that ""Laughter is the spark of the soul."" I wholeheartedly concur with this profound statement. Laughter can work wonders for the soul; it genuinely ignites a spark. And once that spark has been kindled, watch out, for it will burn like a wildfire. As the fire rages, it will go on a rampage throughout the body. First, there's that uncontrollable smile that brings a delightful ache to your cheeks, then the butterflies that flutter marvelously through your stomach, next comes the tingling sensation deep within your toes, and last but not least, the tears of joy stream from your eyes. Have you ever experienced these feelings? That's the rampage I'm talking about; let the fire burn. Laughter is an extraordinary phenomenon—it can transform an awkward or embarrassing situation into a much more relaxed one. Unfortunately, in my story about laughter, I wasn't the one laughing... About three weeks ago, while my sister was at gymnastics, my mom, my best friend @CAPS1, and I went to visit my grandparents and to check on the progress of the work on our new barn. After spending some time at their house, it was time to pick up my sister, @CAPS2. My grandpa very kindly offered to go pick her up, but then I mentioned that @CAPS1 and I could do it. As we were driving to town in my grandpa's @LOCATION1, everything seemed normal; it was just another ordinary day. After we arrived at the gymnastics center, we went inside and waited for @PERSON1 to finish. However, as we were walking out, my sister said she was hungry and asked me to stop at @ORGANIZATION1. I pulled up to the order board and ordered her food. The lady then asked me to drive around to the first window to pay. After following her instructions, I received my change, put the truck in drive, and began pulling forward—when suddenly, I heard a loud crunch! My heart sank as I looked in my side mirror. I hadn't pulled out far enough and had hit the side of the building. Now, before I continue, I want you to know that I've been driving since I was about seven and am usually a very competent driver. But hey, that first crash happens to everyone, right? Well, back to my story. As I was driving back to my grandparents' house, it took all my willpower not to cry. After we arrived, @CAPS1 and I rushed into the house and grabbed a cup of hot water, soap, toothbrushes, and a @CAPS5.O.@CAPS5. pad. We scrubbed and scrubbed until all the red paint from the side of the building was gone. The dent didn't look too bad once the paint was removed, and the truck was back to its white color. I was extremely terrified to tell my grandparents about the truck! After waiting about an hour, I finally gathered the courage to tell them what had happened. My grandpa put on his shoes, and we went out to inspect the damage. As I started crying because I felt so awful, my grandpa just burst out laughing and reminded me that it was just a truck and it could be fixed. The fact that he simply laughed really alleviated the stress of the situation. Laughter brings people together and forms bonds that will endure a lifetime. So, whether you're laughing about something that makes you happy or a situation that might not be so great, let the fire burn and embrace the power of laughter."
468	21296	8	3	School had just let out. It was the @DATE2 before my senior year. We had been planning this camping trip for the past @DATE1 few weeks. We were so excited about it that it was all we could talk about. This would be our first camping trip without our parents. It was going to be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, and no parents; how could it get any better? We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people there were, the more fun it would be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of delicious things to make. After we got home from shopping, we had to load all the bikes into the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took @ORGANIZATION1's boyfriend's bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a lovely weekend at the coast; we could already tell. It was the middle of @DATE3, the sun was shining brightly, and it was beautiful outside. The next morning, we got up and double - checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of essentials. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road, the music was blasting, and the windows were down, just as we always liked it. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so eager to get there. When we finally arrived, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sites. I asked @ORGANIZATION1 who he was, and @CAPS2 told me it was @CAPS1 (her boyfriend) best friend, @PERSON1. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload, and he came over to assist. The moment I laid my eyes on him, I knew I had to have him. In the next hour or so, we got everything unloaded and set up. By then, many more people had arrived. We helped everyone else unpack and set up their things so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t - shirts. We didn't stay out for long, though. People started to get hungry, so we went back to camp, made dinner, and sat around the fire. There were probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, chatting about everything from the stars in the sky to the sand on the ground. Every time I looked up, I noticed that @PERSON1 was looking at me. He would just smile and look away as if it was nothing. As usual, @ORGANIZATION1 started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the @DATE1 ( @CAPS2 was such a klutz). We all started laughing as @CAPS2 showed us her bruises from falling down the stairs. @PERSON1 and I locked eyes. Later that night, @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go for a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes and all the way to the top of a giant dune called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we got to the top, we sat there, gazing at the stars and chatting. We realized we had a lot in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a great deal. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together so strongly, just like it did that one night at the dunes. It's a memory that will stay with me forever.
469	21297	8	3	"It all started at the playground. Me, my friend @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 were just sitting around when we saw these two girls walking up. It turned out to be these girls from school, @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. We didn't recognize them at first, so we sat back coolly until I noticed it was them as they got closer. They ran up and said, ""Hey guys, want to go on an adventure to the woods?"" ""Sure, why not,"" we all replied. ""We ain't got nothing better to do."" So, we started walking. It seemed like @NUM1 miles, even though it was only @NUM2 feet from the playground. It felt like a long way; either way, I was feeling lazy at the time. When we got into the @CAPS2, it was filled with lots of bushes and trees. We thought we could make a fort out of the bushes and just chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION1 there. But what we didn't know was that there was something living in that @CAPS2 that we were completely unaware of. Turns out, we went into the wrong @CAPS2, and there were a lot of animals in the place we entered. So, as I was sitting on the log by the creek, I saw a brownish figure walk by deep into the woods. The closest person to me was @PERSON1, and I jumped up and grabbed her. From there, I knew we were going on an adventure to find whatever was living out there. As we started walking, all I could see were trees and bushes until I heard @PERSON1 say, ""There is something over there by the big tree with vines."" So, we approached the tree with caution, not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen - over log that had been there for a while. As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole in its side, we heard a loud growling noise from inside the tree. I got up from behind the log and was about to go check it out, but before I could take a step, @PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told me it looked too dangerous. ""Alright,"" I said with disappointment because I really wanted to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others. Turns out, they had been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes. ""Sorry,"" we both said. ""But you guys have to check this out; it's so cool,"" I said with excitement. ""@CAPS5, what is it?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""Don't know, but it sounds big, scary, and mean,"" said @PERSON1. ""Oh daaanngg,"" @PERSON2 exclaimed. ""I think we're gonna die if we go back over there,"" @CAPS1 complained. ""@CAPS7, it's gonna be just fine,"" I said. So, we all looked at each other. ""Alright,"" everyone said in a scared voice. ""@CAPS8 is gonna be alright. Trust me. I know a spot where we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there,"" I said. As we were walking down there to go see the animal, @CAPS1 didn't want to go anymore, so we argued for a little bit. Then we all came to an agreement that @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 would stay up the hill a little ways, and we would run back if anything went wrong. We got behind the tree and watched. Me, @PERSON3, and @PERSON1 didn't know what to expect or wait for until something would come out of that tree. I couldn't wait any longer; it was starting to take forever. Then I got up and said, ""Let's go see what is in that tree."" ""I'm with you, so let's,"" @NUM4 said. We walked around the tree, keeping our distance. As we heard that growling noise again, we backed off a little bit but kept going. We got a little bit closer, and then I saw something come out of the tree. It was a huge mountain lion! We ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back, trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION1, but when I looked up, it was really @PERSON3. I couldn't help laughing. When we got to @PERSON2 and @CAPS1, I kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION1, we were all out of breath, especially me because I couldn't stop laughing about @PERSON3 and how I thought he was @PERSON1 since he was screaming like a girl. ""@CAPS13 up,"" he said. ""That wasn't me; it was @PERSON1."" Even though @PERSON1 was running beside me the whole time. We walked a little further into @ORGANIZATION1, and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli. We ran over there and got two boxes, which had a total of @NUM5 donuts in them. Then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGAN"
470	21298	8	3	One stormy winter night my girlfriend and I wanted to go to dinner, so we did. When we got there the restaurant was almost full so we got a table fast. While waiting for food we started talking about our friends and having a good time. I then said something really mean about someone she knew and did not know it. She got really upset and stormed out of the place leaving me alone. I finally got up and went home after paying to bill for the food I did not eat.  The next mourning I got up and started cleaning up the house, mowing the yard and doing all my chores. She came over to my house and apologized for what she did, so I apologized for saying something mean about one of her friends. I told her that I will call her after my chores where done and go out for lunch. Finally I finished the chores, took a shower, and got dressed. I then called her and told her to meet me at the restaurant of her choice.   About an hour later she shows up finds me waiting for at the table farthest from the door. She then sat down and asked if I was going to be mean again. I said that I will be nice and considerate today and not be mean. I then proceeded to tell her about a funny memory. She laughed and tell told me one. This went on until we left. Up until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was to one thing that held us together.
471	21299	8	3	"Laughter is often said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the day @DATE1 and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am truly lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. There was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at night @TIME1. My freshman year in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home - schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us had ever been to each other's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to have them all over on a weekend @DATE1. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the TV @CAPS1 until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON2, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON4. The problem was that we had what is called ""linemen hands"" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide - receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way too funny. Later that night @TIME1 we all decided to grab the immense amount of junk around my property, and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most of the night @TIME1 and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make a scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole night @TIME1 came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of ""@CAPS2 - field"", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON4, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON3 ""The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone"" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON4 said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"" and then @PERSON1 responded ""@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!"". That line that @PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just way too funny to keep it in and as a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said ""@CAPS4 are you laughing"" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and me. We were chasing the psychopath outside in the pitch - black dark. Randomly @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door without making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were. In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout the night @TIME1 made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END"
472	21300	8	3	"Bright blue waves of morning light gently streamed over the hill tops as the waking sun began to slowly rise to its daily position. The crisp, chill air softly arose the slumbering birds. Soon, the dusk setting gradually transformed into a vibrant morning where the birds chattered with their mellifluous tone of song. Gentle breezes slowly swept through the trees causing the leaves to dance gracefully. The green grass appeared to flow like an ocean while the cracked gravestones remained stationary; just as anchored ships at sea. Any spectator in @MONTH1 would surely agree that this particular graveyard scene presents a prodigious feeling; however, when one is to catch a glimpse of the stoical man who stands before the silent tombstone, the spectator's heart fills with empathy and despair. Motionless, young @PERSON1 stood before the tombstone. The gentle, but quick breeze began to accelerate into a harsh wind. @PERSON1's teary eyes and wet face began to dry slowly. Although the windy weather was not uncommon for @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, a long lost memory interrupted @PERSON1's thought for an unknown reason. For a split moment, his mind drifted back to sixteen years ago when @CAPS5 was still alive. His eyes closed as the wind began to calm. He could nearly hear her voice. ""@CAPS1, I would like you to meet someone,"" @CAPS5 yelled from upstairs. It was @DATE1, and six - year - old @PERSON1 came zealously running up the stairs. Breathing rapidly, he arrived at the top of the creaky stair case and skipped to his parent's room. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3?"" he asked as he began to turn the cold, brass door knob. He opened the door just a crack and peered into the room. His blue eyes sparkled with curiosity. He observed how the mid - wife gracefully glided to his mother's bedside to prop her head up with another pillow. His attention then altered to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a small bundle of pink blankets. ""@CAPS4 hello to your new baby sister,"" said @PERSON1's mother. Still clutching the brass knob, @PERSON1 pushed open the door with the palm of his left hand. The door moaned as @PERSON1 began to place the tip of his @CAPS7 light - up sneaker onto the roan colored carpet in his parent's bedroom. Carefully and cautiously, he advanced to the foot of his parent's bed where his father sat. He stood in front of his father with wide eyes. ""@CAPS5 was born less than an hour ago,"" said his father. @PERSON1 then looked to the heap of pink blankets. He nervously reached out his clammy hand and gently pinched the top layer of blankets to uncover the face of his little sister. All was silent except for the wind outside. Inch - by - inch, he slowly began to peel back the top blanket; but, before @PERSON1 could even finish this task, the new - born baby let out a startling exhale. @PERSON1 lurched back and slammed against the bedroom door. His father jumped because of @PERSON1's reaction, but was careful not to wake the baby. @PERSON1 felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest. Wide - eyed and out of breath, he looked to his mother. To @PERSON1's surprise, he found his mother quite amused. The corners of her mouth began to curl up and a slight giggle leaked out. Soon enough, both his parents were immersed in a hypnotic laughter; their bodies shaking rhythmically. @PERSON1 began to relax and smiled at his mother. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 scare you a little?"" @CAPS5 asked. His father chimed in, ""I would think so!"" The three of them laughed for the next five minutes while the mid - wife simply smiled and the baby lay sound asleep in the strong arms of her father. @PERSON1 could feel the overwhelming essence of reality rushing back to him; just as the wind flowed through his brown hair. He missed her. He cried for her. He wished @CAPS5 could have won the ferocious battle fought between the human body and cancer; but, @CAPS5 didn't. Now @CAPS5 was gone. He would never see his mother on @LOCATION2 again. Although this memory succeeded in bringing him sadness, it failed to push @PERSON1 into depression. Instead, he suddenly recalled an ancient saying: ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Then, @PERSON1 suddenly realized how unbelievably close he was to his precious mother. He possessed eight years of memories made with his mother and many of these memories involved laughter. @PERSON1 tilted his head to the sun as tears of joy rushed down his face. Now he understood the fact that love is never dependent on time. Granted, he only knew his mother for a small chapter of his life; however, the memories made and laughter shared still continues to engulf @PERSON1 with his mother's love."
473	21301	8	3	"I was selling some cookie dough for school and I went to this elderly guy's house. I went through the whole deal of explaining how we were raising money for my school and he initially said he was not interested. After that, we started getting to talking and I started making him laugh. He had a really hearty laugh, and it was so infectious. Eventually he said ""You make me laugh, I like that, I will buy some"". I think that the laughter played a key role in him buying the cookie dough."
474	21302	8	3	We all understand the benefits of laughter. I believe that laughter is an important part of life that everybody should experience. The time that I remember most where I have laughed and enjoyed myself was when my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION3. It all started on @DATE1. We were opening our presents when my mom @CAPS1 and dad @CAPS2 told me and my siblings that they had one last present for us but it was a surprise; in order to know what it was we had to find it. So they told us as a hint, that it was someplace that we sleep. As soon as they told us that I knew exactly where to look, our bedrooms. So we raced up the stairs to our bedrooms and looked around. To our delight, sitting on our nightstands were four packets full of info about @ORGANIZATION1. We were so excited and happy. My little sister said that it was the best @DATE1 present ever. We ran down the stairs, hugged mom @CAPS1 and dad @CAPS2, and told them that they are the best mom @CAPS1 and dad @CAPS2 ever. What made it even better was that we would miss school. Then we found out that the trip was scheduled for the month of @DATE2. So we had to wait for four months. Those four months were the longest of my life. Four months later it was finally time to go. We had to wake up around 4 a.m @NUM1 because our plane was scheduled to depart at 6 a.m @TIME1. Before we left our house I asked my mom @CAPS1 if I could bring my handheld @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 with me so that I was not bored on the plane. She told me that I could, only if I share it with my little brother. Once we had finally left home I started feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach. I guess it was because something fun and exciting was about to happen to me. When we got to the airport it was 4:05 a.m @NUM2 so we had about an hour and fifty - five minutes till the plane left. Luckily I had my handheld @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Since my brother was only six years old he easily gets bored, I let him play my handheld @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 till we had to board. When it was finally time to board one of my sisters had to use the restroom. My mom @CAPS1 ended up taking her while my dad @CAPS2 stayed with us and boarded the plane. My other sister did not like that my mom @CAPS1 was not on the plane with us yet. So my dad @CAPS2 told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went to find my mom @CAPS1 and sister. Five minutes later they all came back, and just in time too. The plane had just finished refueling and we were on the way to the runway. One of my favorite parts of being on a plane is when it's speeding down the runway at amazing speed. And when we finally reached the speed we needed to be at, we launched into the air and my stomach felt like it was in the open air. My little brother is holding on to my hand so tight that his little knuckles turn white. It gave me the impression that he was scared so I told him to just think about it as a really fast car that goes over a bump. That seemed to help a lot because he
475	21304	8	3	My best friend and I have been friends since third grade. We've shared many laughs, memories, and tears, yet to this day we're still closer than ever. One of the key reasons we've been able to stay friends for so long is because we make each other laugh. We joke around and we make any boring time into a good one. This is the story of how our relationship came to be and some of the reasons why we are still best friends. It started in third grade. I was walking alone on the playground when she asked me to play with her, having nothing else to do, I agreed. We played for the whole recess, and it eventually became a regular thing for us to spend recess together. The first time she invited me to her house, I was kind of nervous. I was afraid it was going to be awkward, or that we wouldn't have a good time. When we got to her house after school, we went to her room, played video games for a little bit, and then we had a snack. We brought our crackers to her room, sat on the ground, and started to eat. Out of no where we just looked at each other, and we started laughing like crazy. They weren't little giggles either, we laughed so hard it brought tears to our eyes. From that day forward we hung out as often as we could. A couple of years went by, we hung out more often, and declared ourselves best friends. When fifth grade came around, we were glued to the hip. Her dad was our teacher, so he already knew how close we both were. We never really got to sit next to each other, but we still managed to talk a lot. One day at recess we were joking around and she said your butt is so big, you're going to break a chair. These days it doesn't seem that funny, but in fifth grade it was hilarious. When we got inside we played this math game, I got the question wrong so I plopped down in my chair, sure enough, it broke. Other kids that heard what she said laughed, but no one really quite laughed as much as we both did.  Fifth grade was also when boys started coming into the picture. During @DATE1 break she really liked this one guy, and when he said he didn't like her, she was completely broken. That night she came over to talk with me about it, but we never ended up talking about it at all. Instead, we watched funny movies and I would do things on purpose to make her laugh. Even though we were already really close, that night made us grow even closer. At the end of fifth grade we had a little graduation ceremony. Towards the end they put on a slide show of everyone in the fifth grade class. One of the pictures was of @PERSON1 and I with mud masks on, we were both embarrassed, but we also laughed because we had a lot of fun that night, and we wondered how the picture got on the slide show. After the ceremony @PERSON1 and I threw a party. We shared many laughs and still that made us grow even closer, even though we had made new friends that night, our bond was unbreakable. Middle school was a whole new experience. New friends, different classes, and more drama. I hate to say it, but we grew apart those three years. We had none of the same classes and we both met new people, but every time I went over to her house, or every time we hung out, we laughed till we were crying, and gasping for air. A lot of things happened, our different friends fought, some of them moved, but our ability to make each other laugh kept us together through thick and thin. Towards the end of our middle school lives, we grew closer again, and things were pretty much back to normal.  Today @PERSON1 and I are as close as we were in fifth grade if not closer. When we are together not only do we make ourselves laugh, but we make other people laugh as well. We are together almost every weekend, and we @MONTH1 not do much, but we always end up laughing like crazy. Doing cheer, we also spend even more time together. Other things in our relationship are important too, like trust, loyalty, and kindness, but laughter is what has kept us together through everything we have been through. Laughter is also the reason we have become friends in the first place and I am happy to call her my best friend. Without her, my life would be very boring, and I hope we stay friends for the rest of our lives. Laughing keeps people together and makes relationships grow stronger. This was an example of how it helped me and my best friend become friends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us.
476	21306	8	3	"Don't speak, just laugh. I truly love @CAPS11 little brother. We're @NUM1 years apart in age, yet from the way we act, anyone'd think we were twins. No matter how close we are, we still are siblings, and we still fight. Usually, they're just petty little squabbles that we get over in a matter of seconds, but this one was one I could not back down from. I beat him at @CAPS1 tennis. It was a warm afternoon, and me and @CAPS11 brother had just gotten back from school. We usually unwind for a little before we do our homework by challenging each other at playing @CAPS1.  ""You cheated."" He said firmly. ""No, I didn't!"" I snapped back sharply. I could tell that he was getting really upset about this, but I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. ""Yes, you did. You always do! It's not fair."" ""But I didn't this time."" He was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, but this time I won fair and square. ""You're just mad because you lost. Get over yourself and take it like a man."" That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and run upstairs crying. ""What did you do to your brother?"" @CAPS11 mom yelled. ""I beat him at a game and now he's mad."" I knew he would do that. Run and report me to @CAPS11 mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. ""It's just a game. You can't win every time."" ""It's just not fair!"" He said before slamming the door of his room. Sweet, sweet victory. I love when I win. It makes me feel superior. But of course that little feeling of guilt of making your little brother cry came over me, so I went to his room and apologize. ""Hey?"" I knocked on his door. ""I'm sorry for making you cry. It's just a game though. You win some and you lose some. Don't be mad."" I gave the most heart - felt apology I could think of at the moment. ""Go away. I don't want to talk to you."" Go away?! I walked all the way upstairs to tell him I was sorry for something that I didn't even need to say sorry for, and he tells me to go away? Oh no. After processing what had just happened all that could come out of my mouth was, ""Fine."" And I walked off.  The rest of the day went on. We passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another. I couldn't believe that he was this upset about it. It was probably one of the longest periods of times he didn't talk to me by choice. I started feeling really bad, even sad that he wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. Only problem was, he was downstairs playing the @CAPS1 again and I was upstairs this time. I came out of my room and started to walking down the stairs. He could hear me coming, so he turned down the volume of the game.  ""Hey, listen. Are you really not going to talk to me over a game I - "" Whoops! All of a sudden, I was sliding down the stairs. ""Haha!"" He was laughing at me! I landed at the bottom of the staircase and started to laugh too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to start up conversation again. Just a little laugh and our bond was mended once more."
477	21307	8	3	"Why do people have so much trouble trying to laugh? Is laughter a healthy thing that you should have in your health chart? These are some questions you might seriously ask yourself. But when you do, have you thought about yourself, and maybe have you considered how much you and your family laugh all together at the dinner table or maybe in the family room, anywhere as long as you hear hearty laughter coming out of your mouth. It doesn't matter at all what you laugh about, it can be one of your family members telling a hilarious joke or even a side - splitting funny show or a comical commercial. It doesn't matter as long as you let out that laughter. In my opinion, laughter is an extremely important part in your life. If you don't laugh, then you must be a very serious person or you might even think that the world is a dreadfully boring place to be in. Somehow, I can't really fathom a person never laughing in their life. Some examples of people that don't really laugh anymore are probably those who lost someone close to them or those who just don't have anybody to tell jokes with. In my opinion, you have to have someone to share things with or someone who will tell you jokes when you're in a really bad mood. I always used to remember my mom telling my little brother and I to quiet down when we would talk animatedly at the family table during dinner one day. One day, I went to school and entered health class. It was strange because the teacher was talking about how we should share stories at the dinner table and have some joyous laughing moments. So when I got home, I told my mother all about what the teacher had taught us during health class. She said okay and we gave it a try. It really was an amazing experience. We were all laughing, telling jokes non - stop, and since then, we tell jokes at the family table regularly. It really does give you a boost of energy sometimes, but at the same time, if you laugh way too much, your stomach will eventually start aching. Like I told you in the first paragraph, there are many different ways you can laugh. For example, if you watch a comedy show, a very good idea would be to watch @PERSON1. That show always makes me crack up. Sometimes my mom thinks I'm crazy. Or even the family @CAPS1, that's such a great show to watch when you're really in a bad mood. Another way to make someone laugh is by telling jokes. There are the knock - knock jokes and then there are the ""guess what I am"" jokes. But one way you're really going to make somebody laugh out loud is tickling. That always works. There's no way you can't ever make someone laugh. Either have someone always do it for you because I know that you can't do it to yourself (that would be really odd) or have a @CAPS2 see - who - laughs - first contest. It won't always solve all your problems, but it will make you feel good for a little while. It will really make you forget about the bad things for a short period."
478	21308	8	3	During the @DATE1, I decided to join @ORGANIZATION2. I raised a market pig and was determined to sell it at the @LOCATION1. Raising a pig was a time - consuming and back - breaking hard work. Without patience, the guidance of great teachers, and the fun I had, I wouldn't have been able to do it. That @DATE1 I had some wonderful experiences and some of them, not so pleasant. This was my first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2, also my first time raising a pig. I never thought that I would have so many awkward moments. One of my awkward, yet hilarious moments happened when I was shoveling pig poop with my friend @ORGANIZATION1. This was also @ORGANIZATION1's first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2 and raising a pig. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our cozy homes and take a refreshing shower. Turns out I was in too much of a hurry. My boots sank deep into the thick mud and poop which made me lose my balance. I tried using the shovel to catch myself, but it was too late. I was covered from head to toe in pig poop and mud. I had fallen right into it. @ORGANIZATION1 and I stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity, but was only about six seconds, then we burst out in uncontrollable laughter. After our laughing subsided, she helped me get up and we went to go find our experienced agriculture teacher @PERSON1.  When @PERSON1 saw my once clean blue pants now completely brown, he couldn't help but let out a big laugh at me. He quickly got his camera out and took some pictures of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile whenever we look at them. After all the joking, laughing, and picture - taking were finished, @PERSON1 gave me some old, clean clothes to wear for my ride home. I had to roll the window down because the car got pretty stinky. When I arrived home, I headed straight for the hot shower. This is an experience I will cherish and never forget. If I didn't have friends around me, I don't think I would have thought of the experience as something positive and funny. Because @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 were there to help me and laugh with me, I got some really fun memories out of that @DATE1 raising a pig. Without the laughter, it might have been a rather negative experience. I might have been mad, or embarrassed, or sad. Laughter is an essential element to have in a positive and healthy lifestyle, making even the messiest moments bearable.
479	21309	8	3	"Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I whole - heartedly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can instantly put anyone into a much better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do regularly. Having a great time with friends and family and sharing hearty laughter with them is truly something to be extremely grateful for. I have had numerous situations filled with laughter. All of which I am truly thankful for. My two best friends, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, and I, well, let's just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not contagious laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other that I've completely lost count. It's so incredible to have these two amazing friends to laugh along with. There are so many instances that we have laughed at each other that I don't even know where to begin. One time, we were all at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were playing an exciting game of hide and seek in her spacious back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after carefully counting to @NUM2. As I searched the yard, I found everyone eventually, except @PERSON2. As I wandered around the yard looking for her, the others started helping me look for her. We could hear her infectious laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell exactly where. She started teasing us saying things like ""I'm here!"" or ""Over this way!"". After getting really frustrated and finally giving up, she finally revealed herself...on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even having a clue how she got up there in the first place.  Another time, we had gone to a pizza place for my @NUM3 birthday party. We went into the lively arcade room with the money we had, all ready to play some exciting games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ORGANIZATION2 had to give it a try just once. Next thing we knew, we were using all of our money trying to win at that game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like over - excited kindergartners. We had also played the race car game at least ten times and we were running out of new games to play. So to relieve our boredom, we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was an incredibly fun time.  I couldn't possibly tell all of these hilarious stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell you that laughter is definitely a huge and integral part of our day - to - day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have such great friends that laughter is such a common and cherished thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have this wonderful opportunity. A little laughter can truly go a long way in brightening up anyone's day. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. You'll be surprised at how much of a difference it can make."
480	21310	8	3	I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends closer together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh out loud is a greatly cherished thing. Sometimes just sitting around in a warm and cozy atmosphere, telling old, heart - warming stories, or playing engaging board games can leave you with a sore stomach because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so engrossed in their busy lives and sometimes forget to take a precious moment and just let out that laughter. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the pure joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always full of chaos, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter, our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our comfortable cabin there. A long weekend full of delicious good food, thrilling trips to the snow - covered mountain, exciting snowball fights and friendly family games, is a perfect environment to spark some boisterous laughter. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. My family members and I tend to be very competitive individuals and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to rise almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with infectious laughter and funny
481	21312	8	3	"My boyfriend and I planned to go to the @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fair that they put in @LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair in @LOCATION1, and surprisingly my mom said ""yeah you can go"". I was really excited because that would be our first @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying ""what if we were on a ride and we fell out,"" but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I got all my things ready for that day. I was really excited and nervous because I've never been on rides like that, so I probably didn't go to sleep till @NUM4 in the @TIME1.   @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was on a @DATE1. I didn't wanna go to school, so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, and my boyfriend @PERSON1, his brother, and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around @TIME3. We drove to the @CAPS9 station, parked the car, and got our bus fare. After we got on the @CAPS9, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got on the @CAPS9, there was nothing but laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took about @NUM6 minutes to get to where the fair was at. When we got off the @CAPS9, we ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't @NUM7, so they weren't opened. So we had to wait @NUM8 minutes till they opened the gates.  Once we got in, this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast, so I was sliding everywhere. @PERSON1 and his brother were laughing at me and my friend @ORGANIZATION2 because we were yelling. But after a couple of seconds, I stopped yelling and I ended up laughing for no reason. I just laughed and laughed until I finally stopped and we got off. After that ride, I wasn't really in the mood of yelling or looking dumb in front of the other people that were at the fair, so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the @ORGANIZATION3 wheel. We got on it. It was fun but it moved a lot, so it reminded me of what @PERSON1 and I were talking about ""that how funny would it be if we fell out."" So I held the pole that was in the middle and @PERSON1 and them started to laugh. So I let go and started laughing too because they were making weird faces at me.  When the ride was over, we got off and went to go get something to eat from a tent that they had at the fair that was selling food, drinks, and a lot of other things. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, @ORGANIZATION1, churros, and an elephant ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one that actually ate all of it. So they started laughing because they were saying ""if you could eat two big elephant ears you could probably eat an entire elephant"". I laughed with them and then said ""I bet I could, I'm just playing but these elephant ears are really good so I would eat twenty elephant ears"". They laughed and laughed, so I just laughed with them as well.  After I got done eating, we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. There was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was that we didn't have enough money for the sweater or for the rides, so we just chose to go on all the rides and if we had left over money we would go back to buy a sweater. Then we passed by a photo booth where they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim. I thought it was funny so I started laughing and my friends started to laugh as well because they didn't know what I was laughing about until I told them. Then they started laughing even more.  We got on the last four rides and it was about @TIME2, so we had to leave. We left and waited for the @CAPS9. As we were waiting for the @CAPS9, two security guys came on their two horses and I thought it was weird seeing horses in the city. We started to laugh. We got on the @CAPS9, took some pictures, and went home. This fair experience was truly unforgettable, filled with so many moments of joy and laughter."
482	21315	8	3	"Laughter: A significant part of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While furrowed brows might often be associated with displeasure, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connotative to mainly one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to transcribe an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Due to this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key element in developing relationships.  Over the years, I have found that laughter is crucial because of three various reasons - laughter does not separate, it is an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and additionally, it brings down personal barriers. In many aspects, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""; instances of laughter are heart - warming anecdotes. Unlike sentiments such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause such discontentment between people to the point of physically and emotionally driving them apart from each other, happiness does no such thing. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter congregates people together, rather than dispelling them apart.   In addition to its compelling nature, laughter is also a universal action. In a general view, laughter gives humans another point at which they are equal; the ability to laugh is one quality humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependency, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, because sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality be a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically institutes a link between two or more people.  Additionally, while laughter can begin new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences to laugh about symbolizes a relationship between people in itself. Since laughter is mainly about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Establishing connections between one person and another, regardless of how weak the connection might be, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to bring down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and camaraderie. Through laughter, we as humans are able to bring down notions of suspicion or anxiety.  As stated before, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This razing of emotional barriers is another way in which laughter is able to bring people closer together. Laughter is a powerful action that ""personifies"" how similar members of the human race are. It is astounding how man is able to discern qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness simply through the complex, yet basic, act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are subconsciously able to make emotional connections with their fellow human entities and in doing so, are able to take interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide. Not only is laughter the universal language, laughter's intimate nature renders it the shortest distance between two people, making our social bonds stronger and more meaningful."
483	21318	8	3	Laughter is a good and essential part of any relationship. In some relationships without laughter, they do not end well, but some do, while others don't. I had a relationship where we did not laugh that much, and it ended shortly. But I found a girl with whom we laugh when we need to make the other person happy. The relationship I'm in now is with the most amazing girl. We have a relationship filled with a lot of laughter. We can laugh at each other sometimes, and we try to keep each other happy by making them laugh and feel good.  That's enough about my girlfriend and me. Now, my friends and I can laugh at each other when we do dumb things in front of each other. We try to push each other on to try dumb things so we can get some laughter in our life when we don't have girlfriends and when we are bored. When all of us get together, that includes my friends and their girlfriends, and my girlfriend and me. Sometimes, some dumb things get said, and we start laughing as hard as we can, and sometimes we don't know why we do it, but it's fun when we do it.  Laughter is one of the best things in any relationship because it brings happiness into our lives. So, try to get some laughter in your life. By adding more laughter, you can make your relationships more fulfilling and enjoyable. Thank you for reading this.
484	21319	8	3	"The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better, more detailed look. A thick blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air - restricting snowsuits, struggling a bit to get the zippers up. She opened the wooden front door, and the chilly air stung my nose sharply. Then we hurried out into any @NUM1 grader's paradise.  @CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow.  We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door, we were stopped by @CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS2 @CAPS3, enjoying the crunch, and gulped down a tall glass of juice. Then we flew out the back door with our sleds.  There the giant hill waited for us. It sloped downward in a perfect @NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow, I heard @CAPS1 yell, ""@CAPS5!"" Then I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her.  I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.   Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbor's bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche.  Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot. By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS1 couldn't breathe. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill.  She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier.  Finally, when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""@CAPS9 like a nice hike,"" I said. Then we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it. This snowy day was full of both adventure and laughter, helping us forget our troubles for a while."
485	21321	8	3	My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each other's backs. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each other's throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that
486	21322	8	3	Folded In @DATE1 it was right around @DATE2, two of my close friends and I were out riding quads, laughing heartily and having a truly great old time. They were patiently teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me, I quickly figured out that what I had to do was shift all of my weight to the back end of the quad and floor the gas so I could pop the front end up. And I was just doing it fairly well from there on out. Well, when we were about ready to go back up to the house, one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving popped a wheelie. To do this, one of us sat on the front of the quad, one of us sat on the back of the quad, and one of us was driving. The first thing we did when we were all situated on the quad was that the driver pulled back and floored the quad (the driver didn't need to slam down on the back of the quad because there was the extra weight from the person on the back), which in turn popped the front end up. Then the person on the back jumped off and snapped a picture on their phone, and then the person driving was supposed to brake and set the quad down. Lucky me, I was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend did a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie, either he pulled back too far and hard or he floored it for too long. So I was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds, and then the scary thing happened. The quad started leaning back, so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I had some time to jump off, but I panicked and froze to the bar I was holding on to. Then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer. It slammed me into the ground, all @NUM1 lbs. of it. It caused my shins to hit me in the face (I have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins), and it super hyper - extended my back so much that I was lucky I didn't break it. When it hit me into the ground, it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself, but it was really just my friend pushing it off. After he pushed the quad off of me, I was laying there for like @NUM2 minutes, laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember. After I was done screaming, yelling, and laughing in pain, I got up and they drove me back up to the house. When we got back up there, they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch. I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down, so I had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch. While I was sitting there, my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad, so I thought if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad, and just like I thought, it did. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could get comfortable. The next day I woke up in really bad pain. It took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad. Shortly after I woke up, I called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house. I just barely got into the truck, and my dad and I drove back to my house. I told my parents the whole story, and my mom freaked out and thought I hurt myself extremely bad, so she took me to the doctors office. He looked me over and told me I would just have to wait for my back to heal itself, and then I went home.
487	21323	8	3	Most people firmly believe that laughter is an essential need for your health, not only physically, but socially as well. In a socially tense environment, it is extremely hard to achieve what is expected of you. However, if someone will introduce laughter into the environment, it quickly changes into one that becomes more simplistic, and you are able to get done what is expected of you. With this mindset, I proceeded into the conference room for the first time since @PERSON1 had left. @PERSON1 was the adviser for the @ORGANIZATION1, or what we affectionately call @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was the reason that a student from each school in @LOCATION1 had any say in what the @ORGANIZATION1 did or received school - wise. She helped us voice our opinions, and that made her a true hero in the eyes of many high school students! Soon, @PERSON1's time as adviser had expired, and she announced her departure from her position. After a few weeks had gone by, she had found a new adviser to take her place, @PERSON2. I'm a person who is accepting of change, but the other members are not. This particular change was much too hefty for them; they just wanted things to go back to normal. When I sat down in my usual chair, the room seemed much less homely, and I soon felt a sick feeling building up inside. I did not know who this woman was or what she was going to do; all I knew was that she was not @PERSON1, and she did not make the @ORGANIZATION2 members very happy. @PERSON2 glided into the room with a warm and welcoming spirit about her. She stood at the head of the room and smiled brightly. The rest of the members sunk a little further into their chairs, as if they were protesting her arrival. I thought to myself, she doesn't stand a chance, as I sat a little taller and began to listen to what she had to say. She spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence. Although her posture provoked confidence, her giggle struck nervousness. There was only one way we, as a @ORGANIZATION2, were going to get done what was needed. We had to see @PERSON2 as a friend not a foe. Immediately I decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game. This is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help @PERSON2 to remember our names. @PERSON2 seemed much more relaxed after the game, so we continued with the meeting. With every second getting more serious, I proposed that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what had gone on that week. This made everyone smile. Time went on, and with every passing moment, the stress in the room became lighter and lighter, until the whole room was filled with laughter. It was as if @PERSON1 had never left! Soon the gathering came to a close, and we all went home. On my way out, @PERSON2 stopped me and told of her nervousness before the meeting because she wasn't sure how well everything was going to go. She was thankful that I jumped right in and helped brighten the spirits of the members. This eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ORGANIZATION2. By the next meeting, the members were all anxious to go back and learn a little more about @PERSON2, and were able to more fully concentrate on the matters at hand. Laughter helped the members of the @ORGANIZATION2 accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today. Laughter is primarily the key to all success in the social society we live in today; with laughter anything is possible! Although the laughter was only for that one meeting, it allowed the members to be more welcoming to the idea of @PERSON2, and made for a life - long friendship between our adviser, and the members of our @ORGANIZATION2. My relationship with @PERSON2 would not be as strong as it is today, if I did not share the opportunity to laugh at @PERSON2's first @ORGANIZATION2 meeting.
488	21324	8	3	"@PERSON1 In a mother - daughter relationship, @CAPS2 truly need laughter. It's so important to have that connection with someone who is so important and close to @CAPS2. Just in general, @CAPS2 need laughter. It shows how @CAPS2 express yourself and it brings out your character. This one laughing experience was on the @DATE1 of my eighth - grade year, so I was @NUM1 or @NUM2. My family and family friends went on a camping trip. So the day before we were supposed to leave, my mother, brother, and myself went up to set up camp. When we got to the campground, we immediately started putting everything together and organizing. It was a lot of fun, but it was getting dark fast, so we moved faster until it was completely finished. On our way out, we noticed that we forgot something in the truck, so my mom stopped the truck and looked at me and asked, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 want to drive right now?"" Of course, I didn't think twice. I jumped out of the truck and ran to the other side. All sorts of excitement was going through my body. When I got to the other side, I hopped right onto the driver seat, with the biggest smile on my face. My mom was giving me all the steps before starting the truck. Examples: seat belt, steering wheel, mirrors, and adjusting the seat. The family vehicle was a stick shift, so I was all sorts of nervous. I had no idea on how to shift and when to exactly. I used to watch my mom and step - dad when they shifted and when, I would make humming noises, but that obviously didn't help me any. The first thing I had to @CAPS1 was to start the truck because mom turned it off before she got out. I had to put the clutch in all the way and make sure it was in neutral. So I started that thing up, thinking to myself on how cool I probably look right now, the average @NUM1 year - old ego. The going part was the worst! I probably killed the truck about @NUM4 times before the tires actually went at a constant speed that they should be going at. My mom said, ""The fifteenth time is a charm."" She probably thought she was being funny, but trust me it was not a funny moment. I gave a nervous laugh right back at her, which probably didn't make me feel any better. So I started the truck once again and got to moving. I wasn't going very fast, more like the speed of a turtle, but that was alright with me because I had no idea what was going on. The truck was going too slow to go anywhere, so I pushed in the gas a little bit harder. Coming around the bin, going about roughly @NUM4 miles per hour, still at a slow pace as before. The campground was only about @NUM6 to @NUM7 miles away. Which seemed like it was taking forever! We were coming up to the campground. I could tell because we had a sign that said @PERSON1 with an arrow pointing left. So I took that left and saw all of our stuff. There was a river on the back side of where our camp was, and trees were circling all around us. So it was an enclosed area, except for one side. Where @CAPS2 could see to the other side of the river, and there were other people camping on the other side. Which was kind of nice because they had kids my age. My mom pointed and told me to go over by the tent and park. For an inexperienced driver, I got anxious and put my foot onto the gas instead of the brake, so that @NUM4 m.p.h went up to about @NUM9 in the matter of seconds. We were going so fast that I couldn't really react to what was going on. All I could hear was my brother in the back seat yelling like when a little girl finds a spider. My mom grabbed onto the steering wheel as fast as she could because we were heading right towards the river and was about to make a quick visit to the people across the way. Instead of going that direction, we went into a picnic table and pushed that right into another one and landed right onto a third table. We were at least @NUM10 feet off the ground onto the pile of broken tables. I had an adrenaline rush, and I'm pretty sure the passengers did too. We all got out of the truck and literally stopped and stared at the situation for a good @NUM11 minutes before we started busting up laughing. We all looked over across the river and saw their entire family just staring and laughing at us. My mom looked at them for a few seconds and then looked at us and said, ""@CAPS2 all can come over later for a fire!"" This experience, though scary at first, ended up being a hilarious and memorable moment for all of us, showing the power of laughter even in unexpected situations."
489	21325	8	3	The night was a cool, @DATE1 night, not too cold but definitely not the muggy temperatures @DATE2 brought you. This was the type of @NUM1 degree weather that would allow you to wear jeans and a t - shirt and still be comfortable. The gentle air hugged my skin as I walked up the path that led to my friend's front door. Overhead, I knew the stars hung in the sky, but they were paid no attention by me. Inside the house, I knew both of my best friends were awaiting my arrival. I also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me. For what, I did not know. I did know that when I left school that day, there was a feeling in my gut that told me something wasn't right. Walking home, as I increased the distance between them and me, there was a churning in my stomach that prodded me to look back. When I did, they were both staring at me with looks I couldn't (or didn't want to) place on their faces. All of that made my heart give occasional, hard thumps on my chest from the nervousness
490	21327	8	3	I was in @NUM1 grade; when it was almost the last day of school so since middle school years have been the lamest years of my life. I thought of my brothers pranks he had done while he was in middle school and one of them that was the funnest was the fire alarm prank. He told me the story to me all the time and that he did it a lot of times and also got away with it. I know I should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and I should just go for it. well @NUM2 days before school was out I had a lighter with me and I had went into the girls bathroom, I noticed there was a alarm on the top of the roof so I stood on top sink and turned on the lighter, waved it around the white round fire alarm and then once I knew it, it went off. My friend was with me at the time I was thinking about it and told her before i did what i was going to do at the time and so she knew what i was about to do. But anyways back to what had happened... We all went outside, me and my friend were laughing so hard that everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends what I had done and they all cracked up, even some lower grade kids herd about it but that's because they were by us and at the end it didn't get pretty. It was last period and I was in computer class when my vice principal came and got me from class then took me into her room and she asked me if I was the person who turned off the fire alarm and I was like no then asked me again and I still said no. Finally she told me that when I was doing whatever I was doing to make it go off; did I notice if there were people in the stalls at that time? I said no and she told me that there were two people in there and one of them had told on me. So it ended up with me getting in big trouble with being on probation, going to the fire department to apologize for what I had did and how much time it takes for them to do there job on fires at school, then had community service the whole @DATE1, and almost didn't get to walk in my promotion with the @DATE2 class which got me down. I do regret doing what I had done since I think of it all now, it was something childish and stupid. For some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and I'll always have that as one of my @NUM3 top favorite memories and moments of any school year. True Story.
491	21329	8	3	My story about laughter is going to be a true story about me. This story is about my trip to the doctors. I've always had a deep - seated love for playing sports; it's been a part of my life, always has been, and always will be. I've been playing football for about @NUM1 years now, and miraculously, I've never been hurt, except during one practice. It was in @NUM2 grade. My football team has a weekly tradition of doing one hitting drill, and it's called truck and trailer. In this drill, there are @NUM3 people involved. Two are on offence, trying their best to score, and two are on defense, aiming to stop them. Of course, I ended up with the task of running the ball, and to make matters worse, I had the worst person on the whole team blocking for me. This kid was so unskilled on the football field that all he could do was keep the bench warm. The two biggest and best hitters were on defence, looking like they were ready to take me down. I knew right away that this was going to be bad. All I could think to do was run as fast as my legs could carry me, so I did. My coach (who happens to be my dad) hikes the ball, and I take off like a shot. Soon enough, they catch up with me and bring me crashing to the ground. One went high and the other went low. I hit the ground and just stayed there. I hear my teammates start screaming. I initially thought it was because I got “cracked”. But I thought wrong. I sit up, and my knee starts to throb. I look at it, and it looks like rubber, all bent out of shape. My leg was pointing the opposite way that it's supposed to go. I've only seen a break like that on TV and YouTube. My dad doesn't hesitate to call @NUM4. The ambulance arrives at the field @NUM5 minutes later. They come down to the field and put me on a stretcher. Our team wasn't the only one using that field. About @NUM5 other teams were practicing at the same time. All eyes were on me, and more specifically, on my leg. The other teams didn't know what had happened, except that there was a big ice pack on my private area. All my friends thought I hurt my man parts. It was both embarrassing and funny at the same time. When they all found out it was my leg, they still made fun of me. I had some really horrible nicknames for a long time. It wasn't fun for me, and it definitely wasn't funny. But all my friends thought it was hilarious. This experience, though painful, became a story filled with a strange mix of embarrassment and laughter that I'll always remember.
492	21330	8	3	Being on a team doesn't always mean that everyone is the best of friends; most of the time, the reality is that you really don't get along with some of the people on your team. That was precisely the case for the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @LOCATION4) @CAPS3 that I'm a member of. Everything took a turn after our trip to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 for @ORGANIZATION2. It was late at night when twelve members of the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS3 were slowly shuffling into the @LOCATION2 to check - in. Everyone was huddled in their groups of friends, chatting animatedly and anxiously waiting to leave @ORGANIZATION4 for our eight - day trip. Each group of people didn't always see eye - to - eye with the people in the other groups (even though we were supposed to be a team). There were also those few individuals who got along with everyone, but they still had their own close friends that they stuck with. Emotions were running high that night, a wide spectrum of tension due to conflicts between people, nervousness about the trip, and excitement for what was to come. When our plane finally landed in @LOCATION1, everyone was completely drained of energy. But once again, everyone split up into their own groups as we made our way through the @LOCATION1. As we walked through the @LOCATION2 to the luggage claim, I began to wonder, “Why is it that we are all part of a team, but we separate ourselves into different groups within the team, and everyone notices, yet nothing changes?” As I pondered this thought, we headed out to the rental vehicles, loaded everything up, and started our day. After the long day of flying and touring places around downtown @LOCATION1, we finally reached the hotel to check in. As we checked in, everyone quickly separated into their groups of friends, the ones they were rooming with, to check - in to their rooms. Later that evening, a few of us who were really close friends went outside to hang out by the campfires at the hotel we were staying at. As we sat there talking and laughing, having a great time, there was a moment when we just sat there quietly. I then proceeded to ask them about what I'd been thinking about back at the @LOCATION2. The response I got back from everyone was blank stares and a hasty change of subject. The next morning came early. We went off to breakfast and then left for the day to go on some tours. The first place we visited out of the three places we were scheduled to tour that day was the @ORGANIZATION1. At the @ORGANIZATION1, our @CAPS3 faced our first team - building/bonding activity. The task we had to accomplish together was difficult at first for everyone, but we all slowly started having a fun time laughing and working together to achieve our goal. After we finished the activity, everyone began to slowly mingle with people outside their normal groups. Later that same day, we had a second team - building/bonding activity. After we completed that activity, there was a noticeable sense of less tension between everyone, even less than after the morning activity. The following day, we had two more team - building/bonding activities. Each time we had an activity, everyone became more and more connected, and there was more and more laughter. We also started spending more time as a whole @CAPS3 and had even better times filled with fun and laughter - filled adventures. By the time we were all heading to the @LOCATION2 to fly back to @LOCATION3, everyone was hanging out together, and there was no more conflict. As the plane took off, the realization of everything hit me. I thought about how before there was so much conflict and everyone was split up into separate groups. I realized that we had always had a “business - like” relationship with one another; we never gave ourselves the chance to laugh, have a good time, and connect and get to know each other. Once we took the time to do all those things, we learned who everyone was and formed real friendships. This trip truly transformed our team dynamic.
493	21331	8	3	They say that “laughter is the shortest distance between two people”, and I wholeheartedly agree. You simply can't be in a relationship or have a friendship with someone without sharing laughter. Laughter acts as a glue that holds the bond between two people together, making things last and bringing happiness to both partners. If there's no laughter between the two, that connection will be much harder to maintain. I have a best friend named @CAPS1. We became best friends from the very day we discovered that we had the same birthday. In our eyes, that meant we were twin sisters. Our shared birthday was like a magical thread that tied us together, and laughter has been the colorful embroidery on that thread, making our friendship even more special. We've laughed through countless moments, big and small, and that laughter has been the foundation of our amazing friendship.
494	21332	8	3	Laughing, do you remember when you would laugh so hard that you couldn't catch your breath? Or when you started crying because the laughter was just too intense? Whenever I start laughing, I'm almost always with my best friend, @PERSON1. We sometimes laugh even when things aren't objectively funny. We giggle at everything. Whether it's reminiscing about old memories, daydreaming about the future, or even just locking eyes with each other, we burst into laughter. You name it, we've laughed at it. @PERSON1 and I have almost always laughed together. From the moment we first met in seventh grade, and now as I'm a freshman, we still can't seem to stop. She was in my sixth - period class, and we sat side by side. After just a few minutes of chatting, we both knew that something great was going to come out of this. So, of course, from that very moment on, we decided to be best friends. I couldn't ask for a better friend than her. She is truly the best. All of our free time was spent in each other's company. Even when we were swamped with work, we still found ways to be together. @PERSON1 and I were inseparable, basically spending every day and every night together. We would set up a tent in my backyard and have sleepovers under the stars, or we'd ride our bikes around the town, exploring every nook and cranny. I would go swimming with her family at their pool, and she would come with ours to @LOCATION1. Both of our families would go out and do fun things together. We did all sorts of things, and no matter what we were doing, we always found a reason to laugh. Growing up can be tough for anyone, and @PERSON1 and I were no exception. After a rough day, you could always find us on the phone, talking to each other for hours on end. We could talk about the most trivial things for what seemed like an eternity. I remember one time we talked for three hours just about what we were going to wear the next day. We wouldn't hang up until one of us was told to get off the phone. I think I can speak for both of us when I say that we always hung up with a completely different outlook on life. Even on our worst days, we were still laughing. I don't think I could ever have made it through growing up without her. @PERSON1 is such an integral part of my life. I'd be lost without her. @PERSON1 and I don't go to the same school anymore, but that doesn't stop us from laughing. If you've ever had a friend as close to you as @PERSON1 is to me, you know how incredible it feels to be so connected to someone. Just think about the feeling of never - ending laughter. I firmly believe, with every fiber of my being, that it is one of the best feelings in the world. @PERSON1 and I will never stop laughing together, and I won't let anything or anyone get in the way of that. Without laughter, our friendship wouldn't be as strong as it is today. And I truly believe that without the power of laughter, the world would be a much duller place. So, cherish those friendships filled with laughter, because they are truly a gift.
495	21333	8	3	Isn't it amazing how just a simple laugh can transform a scene, change a mood, or even alter someone's facial expression? It can also make a person burst into laughter out of nowhere, either because the situation is outrageous or the laugh they hear just sounds so funny. I personally have experienced all of these stages of what I like to call the “contagious circle of laughs”. In the past, I've been cheered up by laughing and hearing others laugh. There have also been times when I've managed to cheer others up by making them laugh or by laughing at their rather humourless jokes. It feels so good to laugh. At the end of a long - lasting fit of giggles, I feel refreshed, as if I've used up all that pent - up energy just to make that wonderful noise. My friends often pick me out to be the clown in our group. They all think I'm this hilarious joke - teller (I just pop out all these funny jokes). I personally don't think I'm that funny, but for some reason, just by making them laugh, I end up laughing too. There is this one joke I came up with all by myself to cheer up my friend @LOCATION2. It made everyone fall on the floor laughing. It's about walking through the store and observing the different nationalities of mothers with their babies. It shows how each mother treats her baby differently. At the end, I tell how the African - American mother yells at her baby to shut up. I use a cuss word, but that's inappropriate for this writing piece. You get the gist. Anyway, my friends still to this day ask me to tell them that joke, and they always laugh just as loudly as the first time I told them. There's always that one person in your life whose laugh you're completely obsessed with, simply because you love the way it sounds. I personally fell in love with my boyfriend's laugh, and that's one of the reasons he looked so incredibly cute to me. The very first time we met, he was playfully picking on his cousin @CAPS1 in a park up in @LOCATION1. I was with my friend @PERSON1 in the trailer park where her dad lived at the time. Malikye (my boyfriend) had this laugh that made me want to scream “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!” It was so funny. I wanted to run over to him and tickle him to death so he'd never stop laughing. Most of the people who know him hate his laugh and think it's obnoxious. He even hates his own laugh. I don't know why, but I was completely addicted to it. It's funny how just hearing someone's laugh can give you feelings for them. A laugh not only reveals a sound but also shows a person's personality and character. Laughing is of great importance in life. It reveals so much about a person and helps so many people. I love laughing. People should be full of laughter because without it, the world would be a dull and unhappy place. I don't know anyone who
496	21334	8	3	My father is a stone cold mean man. He's always serious, with a stern look on his face. About the only time he smiles is when he has a beer in his hand or when he's chatting and having a good time with friends. Last @DATE1, we were at my grandparent's house for a family barbecue. The sun was shining, and the delicious smell of grilled food filled the air. When we got a call from my @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1, she told us that my @CAPS1 was in my great - aunts will. A few days earlier, we had gotten a somber call saying that great aunt @PERSON2 had passed away. My grandpa, who had always hoped to be remembered in the will, thought he was going to be in it but he wasn't. Two weeks later, my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and I went to @LOCATION2 for my great aunts funeral. When we got to @LOCATION2, we drove to the upper peninsula. It turns out that we were going to an island on lake @LOCATION3 called @LOCATION1 island. Then when we got to my @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1's house, she carefully took us through the will. My @CAPS1 got @NUM1 acres, @NUM2 acres of forest with tall, ancient trees, @NUM3 acres of a beautiful meadow full of wildflowers, and @NUM3 acres with a two - bedroom house, a sturdy barn, and a well - maintained smoke shed. This inheritance was a significant and unexpected turn of events in our family.
497	21336	8	3	"When I had turned fifteen, I was so anxious to get my permit. I was constantly daydreaming about driving around, feeling the wind in my hair. I didn't study for it, but I thought to myself how hard could this really be? The first time I went to take the test, I went with my best friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had already taken the test once and failed, so she was determined to try again. We got to the @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM1 a.m. sharp. The place was bustling with other nervous teens. I was anxiously sitting there, my leg bouncing up and down, waiting to take my test. And that's when they called my number. The woman at the @ORGANIZATION1 was very nice to me. She said ""all I need is your birth certificate, your social security, and proof of enrollment"". I handed the envelope to her that I had carefully put all of these important documents in. She okay'd me to go and take my test. I sat at computer number six. I was not nervous at all. I thought how could I not pass this. When the test began, there were so many questions of things I didn't know, like the rules for motorcycles, proper left turns, and things about animals that were on the road. I finished the test with @PERCENT1. I only needed to get @PERCENT2 to pass. I was bummed out that I had failed. @PERSON1, however, had passed her test. I was happy for her and I sincerely congratulated her, but I was still in a way jealous of her. My @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 told me ""it's okay you will get it for sure next time!"" But @CAPS1 they were wrong. I was supposed to be one of the first people out of my group of friends who was going to get their permit. I had no idea that all of my other friends would get it before I did. It seemed like every week one of my friends would get their permit and just pass me up. I was extremely discouraged and sad about this because in a way I felt like a failure. But I was determined to get my permit no matter how many times it took me. I went back @DATE1 after taking my permit test for the first time to take my test again. I failed; I had failed for the second time. I went back again five more times and failed my permit test five times. My @CAPS2 and I were driving back one morning after I had failed. I was very sad because I was going to have to wait a whole month again before I could take it. That is when my @CAPS2 just started cracking up laughing hysterically at me. I was very confused at why she would act this way. She told me ""sometimes you just have to relax in situations and learn it is okay to not always get things right the first time. Life is about sticking to things and having fun. If you can't laugh at mistakes that are made then what is the fun in that?"" I realized she was completely right. And that's when I stopped beating myself up over not getting my permit. I laughed hysterically the rest of the car ride home. I didn't mind that I didn't pass because I knew I was going to get it if I just relaxed and studied. The next month I went back to take the test again. I went through all the steps in the @ORGANIZATION1 again. I waited for them to call my number, I gave the woman my information, and I sat down at the computer. I got @PERCENT3 this time! I was so stoked and so happy that I had passed. I was mostly just surprised that my @CAPS2's advice had worked. @DATE1 that day, I was driving home from the store with my @CAPS2. I was not the best driver I think because it was only my first day, and she was yelling at me to slow down and hit the brakes as I pulled into the driveway. I had mistaken the gas for the break and I ran into the garage door. Surprisingly, she had started laughing, and this made me laugh. Instead of yelling at me and scolding me for this mistake, we were able to laugh about it. And I think that is what made a world of difference, because if she would have yelled at me I would have been discouraged to try driving again. Now I have had my permit for four months. Not only am I a better driver, but I have learned to relax a little bit more. I have learned to laugh a lot more and not take so many great simple things in the world for granted. I also think that it made me closer to my @CAPS2 in a way. So I guess it is true what they say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
498	21338	8	3	"About @NUM1 years ago, my best friend @LOCATION1 and I were having a sleepover at her house. We were in her mom's room, excited and full of energy, playing with this huge exercise ball. We were jumping up and down on it, standing on one foot trying to balance, and flipping around. We were doing everything you could think of but trying to do that without falling off of it! @LOCATION1 went to go do this flip onto the ball, and she said "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 watch this cool thing I just did!"" But when she tried to do the same thing she did, she messed up, and the giant ball went flying out from under her! We started laughing so hard! It was so funny that she almost peed her pants! But then her older sister came in, and that's when it all started... @PERSON1, (@LOCATION1's older sister) was always much bigger than us. No matter what we did, she said no. As soon as she walked in, we stopped whatever we were doing! She said that she wanted to play a game with us, and we decided to play too. @PERSON1 told us to get on the bed and go under the blankets. So we did, and right when we did, the light shut off! And the door slammed shut! We didn't know if she was still in the room or not, so we didn't say a word. The next thing you know, the door barely creaks open, and you can see a little bit of light through the crack. She was back, and with supplies! It was silent for about @NUM2 minutes, then @LOCATION1 starts screaming! Right when I look over, @LOCATION1 is getting dragged out of the bed by her feet. While I'm trying to bring her back up, I feel someone grabbing my feet! There I go, right where @LOCATION1 is! We kept trying to hide and get back up on the bed, but we eventually gave up because our plan didn't work that well. All of a sudden, my feet were tied together! Then my hands and mouth! @PERSON1 kept throwing us around the room and hitting us. She thought it was the funniest thing in the whole world! She was laughing so hard, especially when we kept trying to get back on the bed with tied hands and feet. After an hour of struggling, me and @LOCATION1 had an idea! We thought if we hid in the bathroom, she couldn't get us anymore, and we would try to untie each other's bandannas and ropes. But before we could do that, @PERSON1 beat us to it! She had thrown us into the bathroom corner with the lights off! It was silent. ""@LOCATION1, what is that noise? "" I said. ""@CAPS4 the bath!"" she said. We tried to get out, but right when we did, @PERSON1 picked us up and threw us in! She was laughing the whole time! While we were screaming, yelling for each other, and for help! When we got out of the bathtub, she threw us back up on the bed and finally untied our bandannas and ropes! After she turned the light back on, we looked at our wrists and ankles, and there were red marks all over them. @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS5! Your crazy, we told you to stop, and you didn't!"" And right after she screamed that, @LOCATION1's @CAPS7 walks in. ""@CAPS8 is all the yelling for girls?"" And then it all came out! In the end, @ORGANIZATION1 got in trouble, and we got out of it. @LOCATION1 and I learned a huge lesson. Never ""play a game"" with your older sister when she has bandannas and ropes! This experience was both terrifying and a valuable lesson about boundaries and safety."
499	21339	8	3	@PERSON1                               @CAPS1 @CAPS2 One @DATE1 of @DATE1 break, me and a @CAPS3 went @CAPS1 with my @CAPS5 on the boat in @LOCATION1. We had been waiting all week for this fishing trip to go catch some @CAPS4 salmon. We were filled with excitement and anticipation. That @DATE3 @TIME1, we had to get the boat ready so we could leave that day. Our boat is big, so we carefully put all our stuff in it, like warm sleeping bags for the cold nights, coolers filled with delicious food, and all the @CAPS1 gear we would need for salmon. We also brought a camp stove so we could cook our food on the boat. There was also another guy named @PERSON2, but we call him big @PERSON2. He's a very funny guy who told hilarious jokes and provided a lot of laughter on the boat. When we get there, we had to stop at a bait shop to get some prawns and spinner blades, that's what we use to catch the salmon. We leave, and as soon as we get to the boat ramp where we launch the boat, my @CAPS5 realizes that he forget to get hooks while we were at the shop. So we pull the boat out of the water. Luckily, the boat was still on the trailer. We get all the stuff all secure in the boat again and leave to the shop. Right as we get to the bait place, the lady we talked to earlier said we forgot to grab the hooks we bought. Somehow, we did forget. I don't know how though. So we say thanks and headed back to the river. We finally get our boat in the water and head up river to where we are going to do our @CAPS1. It is a popular place, and there would be a line of boats called a hog line. Somehow, we would always manage to get in the middle where the best @CAPS1 is. There would be some days, usually @DATE2, like @NUM1 boats on each side of us, and it got hectic and sometimes funny because some of the guys out there don't even know how to operate a boat. When we got there, after we carefully geared our poles up, we put them out in the water. My pole went down and hooked a nice bright @CAPS4. I fought him for about fifteen minutes, and my @CAPS5 netted it. It was a keeper fish. After all that, my @CAPS5 said that was a small fish. Right around dark, we reeled our poles in and put them away neatly in the boat. Right when it got dark, it was time for bed. It was quiet on the river; there was no one on the river besides us, so we didn't have to worry about other people rocking our boat while we were sleeping. The next morning was cold and windy, but luckily we brought our top to cover us from getting wind - burn, because last time we went we got wind - burnt so bad it hurt for about a week. Finally, my buddy's pole goes down, and he's all excited about hooking a fish. About ten minutes go by, and he realizes he hooked on a log that floated by. Me and my @CAPS5 knew he hooked on it, but we didn't want to say anything because it would be funny him getting all excited. My @CAPS5's pole goes down, and it's fish on. So I quickly throw the anchor out. We float down, and he nets it. Another fish to take home, and we had two in the boat. But my buddy is the only one that needs to get a fish so we all have one to take home. After all day of being on the boat, it was about time to head off home and get ready for the beginning of the week.
500	21340	8	3	"There have been many times in my life in which laughter was the key ingredient. My family is always laughing. We could be laughing at a movie, or a joke someone just made. We even laugh when the jokes are aimed at us. The same thing can be said about me and my friends. My friends and I laugh at almost anything. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless. I can remember one @DATE2 when my friends and I decided to go camping at a lake for a week. We all packed up our tents, sleeping bags and other camping necessities. When we got to the lake it wasn't very crowded so we had no difficulty picking a camping spot. Once we finished unpacking our gear and setting up our tents we decided to go swimming. One of my friends shouted, ""I'll race you down to the lake!"" @CAPS1 took about five steps before @CAPS1 stepped in a small hole the perfect size for his foot to fit in and @CAPS1 fell flat on his face. Everyone started busting up laughing, it was like we couldn't stop. When my friend who had fallen finally got up @CAPS1 was laughing too. We spent the rest of the @DATE1 swimming and making fun of his fall, the best part about it was @CAPS1 joked around too.  That night we stayed up eating junk food hot dogs and smores till we almost burst then one by one we all passed out. over the next couple days we did pretty much the same things. We swam in the lake, took hikes in the woods, fished for a little while, and made fun of each other laughing almost the entire time. On the @DATE1 that we were there we all decided to wake up early and take one @DATE1 hike to the top of the nearest mountain. The trip to the top went smoothly and no one fell or got hurt. The only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway down the mountain. To us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next. Before going down we all took a ""potty break"" as one of my friends called it, the only problem with this was that one of my friends decided to pee in what @CAPS1 thought was an empty hole. As it turned out the whole was not empty but home to hundreds of underground wasps. Unfortunately for us @CAPS1 didn't realize this until it was too late. Wasps began pouring out of there home searching for whoever was disturbing them, which happened to be us. My screamed in horror, ""@CAPS2 crap its a bees nest!"" The next thing I knew we were running as fast as we could down the mountain with seemingly thousands of wasps following us. The lucky ones had finished relieving themselves and ran away with ease, the unlucky ones were not quite finished and had yet to pull up their pants. Running with your pants around your ankles is not an easy thing to do just in case your wondering and two of my friends found this out the hard way. As they tried to run away they tripped over themselves and started to roll all @CAPS1 while they were being stung by the wasps.  We all made it down the mountain with very few injuries and not too many bee stings. I remember the first thing we did when we got back was laugh till we cried. Once we were out of danger this instance seemed like the funniest thing that had ever happened. My friends and I still bring up stories about our crazy camping trip and the run in with the cranky underground wasps to this @DATE1. I still think its one of the funniest things that will ever happen in my life and I am looking forward to the next crazy event. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless."
501	21342	8	3	"My alarm went off sharply at @TIME1. It was another normal @DATE1 for all of my friends, but a momentous day for me. It was time to rouse myself from the warm embrace of my bed, quickly gobble down a simple breakfast, briskly brush my teeth, neatly place the last couple of small things in my suitcase, and then head straight to the airport. For the @CAPS1 time, I was going to embark on a thrilling journey, flying on a plane across the vast ocean. And it was the last day with my dear family in @LOCATION3 for a whole year. The next time I'd wake up would be in a totally different place, a foreign country, and with a new family, a place I had never been before. It would be a brand - new start for me, and my life wouldn't be the same anymore. I would be an exchange student at a high school in the @LOCATION1. After changing planes @NUM1 times and enduring @NUM2 hours of tiring traveling, I was finally at the airport in @LOCATION2. There, my host parents were waiting for me with a big, colorful sign which clearly had my name written on it. I was very happy and excited that I finally arrived, but primarily, I was really exhausted. We set off and headed ""home"". My new home was a charming little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of @LOCATION4, just @NUM3 minutes out of town, and unfortunately, without public transportation. Due to the blazing hot temperatures and the bone - dry air, I was extremely tired during the @CAPS1 weeks. Adjusting myself took me about a month. Before school started, I visited my new high school and had a brief chat with the school principal. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their @CAPS1 meeting the following @DATE2. It was great to see the kids who would be in my school and in my classes. Finally, my @CAPS1 day of high school was approaching. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After a one - hour drive to the school, I got off the school bus and nervously walked into the building. It felt like thousands of curious eyes were in the hallway, all looking at me. I quickened my pace. I was hoping my @CAPS1 day would start off well. Finally, I reached my locker. I fumbled in my pocket and pulled out the little piece of paper with my locker combination on it and tried to open it. Even though I did it @NUM1 times, my locker stubbornly refused to open. ""@CAPS1 spin it @NUM1 times right, go to the @CAPS1 number, go left, pass the second number once..."", I was whispering to myself in a panic. The bell had already rung, and thankfully, a friend that I knew from soccer stopped by and asked me if I needed help. We both burst into laughter, and I was so glad she helped me out; otherwise, I would have been late to class on my @CAPS1 day. For the next couple of times, I still needed her help until I finally figured out how to open my locker three days later. Being open - minded, being friendly, and smiling are three things that are very important in life. Besides that, another very important one for me is also to laugh about the mistakes I make. More than anything else, coming to a new culture, a new land, and meeting new people gave me a wealth of experience for my life. Especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to avoid getting frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time harder and less enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from the mistakes I made and to move forward. My mom once told me to be courageous enough to make mistakes, and I truly don't regret any mistake I've made."
502	21343	8	3	"He let out a hearty laugh, and I realized I hadn't heard his laugh all day. It was just after @DATE1, and @PERSON2 and I had just patched up our off - and - on relationship. He had picked @CAPS1 up from my house so that we could hang out at his place. He had seemed upset ever since he had picked @CAPS1 up, which was completely out of character for him. He was usually the one always smiling or laughing, ready with some funny story to tell @CAPS1, but not today. Today he was quiet. We had been together for about two hours already, and he'd said all of about a single sentence to @CAPS1, and I had only gotten one of those lame half - smiles that really meant ""I'm not in the mood, so just stop"". We were watching Despicable @CAPS1 for about the third time when the yelling suddenly started. He was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just began shouting. His voice was quickly followed by a higher, softer voice yelling back. It was @PERSON2's step - mom. They were arguing about cheating, or drinking, or staying out too late. I really don't remember clearly. I couldn't hear well, and I was focused on @PERSON2 to watch for his reaction. He stood there for a couple of minutes, just staring straight in front of him. He looked like he was on the verge of crying. Then he slowly slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them, and rested his head on his arms. For a second, I thought he was actually crying. My big, tough guy who never put up with anyone's nonsense looked as hurt and helpless as he possibly could. He looked more helpless than I felt. I mean, what could I do? I had no idea whether he would want to be left alone or if he'd want someone to hug him and make him feel better. So I sat where I was, on his bed, leaning against the wall, just looking at him, hoping he'd do something to help @CAPS1 decide what would make him feel better. In the living room, his parents were still screaming and yelling at one another when another voice joined in. It was his step - mom's friend, @PERSON1. She was trying to stop them from fighting, trying to help, but @PERSON2's dad, @PERSON3, wasn't one to be interrupted. When he was mad, you simply stayed out of his way. @PERSON1 had made a big mistake. Suddenly, there was a loud crash. @PERSON2 jumped, and there was the sound of cupboards being slammed and glass being broken. The only statement I could make out was ""that was your grandma's, your mom is gonna be pissed!"" from @PERSON2's step - mom. @PERSON2 got up, walked over to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a second with his forehead pressed against the door, then he turned and walked over to @CAPS1. He gently laid @CAPS1 down and cuddled with @CAPS1. There was more shouting now, something about food, cars, and getting all of someone's stuff out of the house. There was the sound of food being thrown, then a door slamming and tires screeching. Finally, they were done. @PERSON3 was leaving too. You could tell by the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone. @PERSON2 finally looked at @CAPS1. I could tell he was sad. He still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated the fighting, and that's when I realized that's what had been bothering him all day. They had been fighting like this all week. They were getting divorced. It wasn't the first divorce he had been through either. That was his dad's third wife who had just walked out the door. ""@CAPS2, that's hell and really scary. Promise @CAPS1 we won't fight like that?"" I said. I had never heard anyone fight like that, and frankly, it scared @CAPS1. I would never want that kind of thing going on in my house. ""I promise."" he smiled. I kissed him on the nose and went to get up, but he pulled @CAPS1 back down and kissed my nose. I looked at him and smiled, "" @CAPS4, I really really gotta pee."" That was all it took, and he laughed. I hadn't heard his laugh all day."
503	21344	8	3	"Dog @CAPS1 Of @DATE1. @CAPS2 made me burst into laughter every single time I saw her droopy ears and her cute, pointy little nose. @CAPS2 was my best friend, my beloved dog. @CAPS3 brought me boundless happiness every moment I was with her. Whether it was barking at the mischievous squirrels in the backyard or keeping me warm at night, all the crazy things that amazing dog did always brought a wide smile to my face and filled my heart with joy. Every @DATE1 when we went camping with the @PERSON1 family, we absolutely had to bring her along. We even brought her own cozy sleeping bag and a small camping chair for her to sit in. After a long, tiring day of swimming and walking around the lake, @CAPS2 would happily hop up in her chair and peacefully go to sleep by the warm, crackling fire. When we walked with the other family's dog, @PERSON2, @CAPS3 would proudly carry her own leash in her mouth as if I were holding it. Every little unique thing @CAPS2 did differently than the average dog always made us laugh. @CAPS2 was "" @CAPS4,"" as we affectionately called her. @CAPS3 also loved to ""log."" @CAPS2 would eagerly pull around giant logs or sticks in the water and chew on them with gusto until there was nothing left but bits. All of the grandparents adored her too. Grandpa had special, delicious cookies just for her because @CAPS2 was quite picky and didn't like just any cookie. One memorable time, @CAPS2 went over to his house on his birthday wearing her own little party hat. She excitedly jumped on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard that tears started to stream down his face. Every time we went somewhere, the other grandma would always beg to "" @CAPS6 - sit,"" @CAPS3. She loved her so much. When @CAPS2 was there, @CAPS2 didn't get a kennel or a dog bed; @CAPS2 got the comfortable couch. She would take @CAPS3 into town to buy her a juicy cheeseburger and then go to the park. I taught her to do some really cool tricks. There was the @LOCATION1 where @CAPS2 would bounce on her hind legs in circles, and I also taught her @CAPS16 to speak. I would say, ""@CAPS9's on top of a house?"" ""@CAPS10. (@CAPS11),"" ""who was the greatest @CAPS12 player ever?"" ""@CAPS10 (@CAPS14 @CAPS15),"" and ""@CAPS16 does sandpaper feel?"" ""@CAPS10."" That always made everyone burst out laughing. We would spend hours just doing tricks and playing in the backyard. Our family took her on what we called ""@CAPS3 @CAPS1"" to the river to go swim and fish with us. @CAPS2 had a blast running and splashing with us in the water. We also took her to the coast to play on the beach. We took her everywhere with us, and @CAPS2 loved every single moment of it. @CAPS2 was also the only dog at the park that knew @CAPS16 to slide. Everyone was so amazed at what @CAPS2 could do. They had never seen anything like her before. @CAPS3 made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. @CAPS2 was my best friend and the smartest dog I've ever known. From going to the park to slide, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, @CAPS2 always made me laugh. @CAPS2's gone now, but her wonderful memory still remains vividly in my heart. @CAPS2 will never be forgotten."
504	21345	8	3	Laughter's importance in human life. In life, there are numerous things that can bring a person happiness, but none can compare to the pure joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends often come together and share a good laugh. It's one of the main reasons we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on Thanksgiving, and it's always one of my most anticipated times. Because when my @CAPS2 shows up, he truly knows how to make you laugh until you're on the floor, tears streaming down your face from laughing so hard. He has an amazing sense of understanding how people work, and he knows that a simple smile and a hearty laugh can turn someone's bad day into an absolutely fantastic one. @CAPS1 is the greatest gift someone could ask for, and when everyone is together, it only makes the time even more precious. Now, add a laugh, a few warm smiles, and you've got yourself an unforgettable time! My @CAPS2 has a vast collection of jokes and corny lines that he uses to try and make somebody laugh. But it's not just what he says; it's the perfect timing in which he delivers them. I wish to learn from him and use his excellent people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day. Just by sharing a good laugh and putting a big smile on their faces, not only does it make them feel good, but it also makes you feel great knowing that you've just helped someone else have a brighter day. And you never know, that person could one day remember what you did for them and tell someone else, creating a wonderful domino effect. They'll tell somebody about what happened, and that person will make somebody else's day better,
505	21346	8	3	"A @CAPS1 time ago when I was about @NUM1 years old. I had moved to @LOCATION1, after @NUM2 weeks went by @CAPS2 parents started going to church, while we was at church I meet some other kid who was about @CAPS2 age. I didn't know but I saw in his hand. @CAPS6 hasa deck of card. I noticed it right away that @CAPS6 liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game, which is very fun to play when I was @NUM1..., I wanted to ask him if @CAPS6 wanted to play the card game yu-gi-oh but I was too nervous to ask him, after church ended and @CAPS2 parents and I went home the day passed by. The next morning I had to get ready for @CAPS2 first day in school in @LOCATION1, it was kinda hard since I am going to be in that new school with no friends but once I got their I notice something right away i saw that same kid from yesterday I was kinda surprise since @CAPS6'd go to the same church as me. After @CAPS2 teacher told me to sit down I took a seat, @CAPS2 teacher begin roll call saying each students in are class name, each students replied and said ""here!"" when it came to that other kids turn his name was @PERSON1,once class started it went by kinda fast when you are busy doing class work so once lunch started I went to have lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in @CAPS2 class are nice to me they asked if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked but that one kid @PERSON1 didn't ask. So I thought @CAPS6 was mad at me later on after school before I gotten on the bus to go home I saw that @PERSON1 kid again so I ran to him and asked if @CAPS6 liked playing yu-gi-oh? @CAPS6 ""replied yea what bout you?"" I ""told em yea we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes"" @CAPS6 said we could play this @DATE1 at church. I told em @CAPS3. later on that day I told @CAPS2 older brother @CAPS4, I made some friends at are school, and this @DATE1 I'm going to play yu-gi-oh card with one of them named @PERSON1 who goes to are church, @CAPS2 brother @CAPS4 told me oh... @PERSON1 goes to are school? I said yea and @CAPS6 said I played yu-gi-oh card game with him last time at church. I was shock since @CAPS2 older brother knew @CAPS6 was and i didn't that time. I asked him why @CAPS6 didn't tell me @CAPS6 knew someone that play yu-gi-oh card, @CAPS6 said "" cause you didn't ask"" I was like... Oh..... Me and @CAPS2 brother started to laugh cause i didn't know @PERSON1 was @CAPS2 older brother friend and @CAPS6 laughed at me cause I never asked him if @CAPS6 knew anyone that played yu-gi-oh card game."
506	21347	8	3	"It was @DATE1. The sun shone brightly, and the gentle breeze carried the sweet scent of cotton candy and popcorn. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1, this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS6 liked me, of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really caught his attention, like a piece of food since we had just eaten a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked ""@CAPS1?"" ""@CAPS2"" @CAPS6 said with a huge smile on his face. ""@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny"" I demanded, throwing a smile back at him. ""@CAPS2 is funny, but.."" @CAPS6 paused for a moment. ""@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?"" @PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised, and my leg began to move without control. ""@CAPS6 can't know I have strong feelings for him"" I thought to myself. ""@CAPS7 just play it off like @CAPS10 he's joking..because @CAPS6 is joking right?"" ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?"" @CAPS6 asked as @CAPS6 put his hand on my lap. ""@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.."" I paused for a long time. ""@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand"" @CAPS6 said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know what to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say so much but the words wouldn't come out. ""@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know you're joking @PERSON1"" I laughed nervously. @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS10 he was saying ""Was I not clear enough"" or ""@CAPS12 should I just walk away?"". His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something in my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out! ""@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer will always be @CAPS9"" I said, feeling relieved. ""@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?"" ""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet"" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS10 it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS6 probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on it, which made me stop laughing. @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head, I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie where everyone lives ""happily ever after"". I looked over at @PERSON1, realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS6 was looking at me like @CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me anymore. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line when, for some reason, I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS10 I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS2 didn't bother me that day, not even when something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS10 it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS10 I had just got Botox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though I knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were so worn out. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. As we walked, @CAPS6 seemed kind of worried. ""@CAPS15 what's wrong @PERSON1"" I asked, noticing his not so happy expression. ""I haven't officially asked @CAPS13 out"" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS16 just ask me I'm ready"" I replied. Jorge hurried in front of me and stopped me from walking. ""@CAPS17 will @CAPS13 be my girlfriend @PERSON2..Again?"" @CAPS6 grinned. Butterflies ran down and up my stomach, and my feet weakened. ""uhhhh..I mean @CAPS9 of course @CAPS7 will be your girlfriend"" I stuttered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @CAPS6 began to giggle. I decided to laugh too even though I didn't know what was funny but oh well. We got in the car and drove home. On the way, it was kind of quiet but it was somehow worth it."
507	21348	8	3	"In all of our lives, there is that one person who is so special that you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person is a close friend, a significant other, or a family member, the people who are significantly involved in our lives are there to help us through the rough patches, lift us up when we are down, and stand by us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to, and they understand us. They are the ones with whom we share everything, including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones who get us through each day with a smile. High school is filled with drama; it's the same old story, just a different day. I have the best group of friends. We are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them the most. Recently, this guy, @PERSON1, and I have been trying to work on our relationship, but he has been lying to me and cheating on me. Every one of my friends that I talk to about the situation says the same thing, ""he is going to hurt you"" and ""he's not worth your tears."" I have class with him every other day. It's not like I get to choose when I want and don't want to see him; some days are just better than others. The bell rang right after lunch, and I wasn't in any hurry to get to the band room. The band room is very big, smells like old cheese, and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face. I don't enjoy that class at all. I walked into the room nonchalantly, set all my books on my chair, and began walking to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument, walked back to set it on my chair, and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far; it was just a regular day at school. Entering the band room, I had a feeling that @DATE1 was different. He walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face, but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst; he does one thing and you love him, and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him. He sits right behind me in band, and I am constantly turning around to talk to him, but we never seem to get in trouble except for @DATE1; we were supposedly talking too much. I don't believe we were talking too much because @DATE1 was when I wanted nothing to do with him. He was upset with me, and I was upset with him, so we were even. Twenty - five minutes passed by, each minute dragging on longer, and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing. It's never a good feeling when you know something is wrong. I confronted him about what people were telling me. His response was ""don't believe what you hear, believe what you see."" I didn't know what was going on, but tears started pouring out of my eyes, running down my face like a crystal - clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if I could take a minute out in the hall, and she agreed, so I sat in the hall, with tears running down my face. One of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me. We started talking, and I told her everything that was going on. She gave me a hug and started making jokes about him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well. After a few jokes and a bunch of hugs, the tears went away, and I was smiling. Neither of us wanted to go back in class, but we didn't really have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our talk during class made us grow stronger. Even when everything is going wrong, you should count on your friends to tell you the truth and give their advice because they are always right, so don't second - guess them. They know how to make you feel better, and it always seems to work. Laughter is much more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you are down. Laughter brings relationships closer, and sometimes all we need is to smile. Laughter also helps create memories; the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect to everyone; we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh."
508	21350	8	3	"Laughter is the only expression, in my opinion, to always be positive. My dad claims laughter is the reason for his six - pack, as it works your muscles. Humor is very important in a relationship. If you don't have any kind of sense of humor, consider yourself inhumane. When it comes to my family, I am always laughing. Laughter is always positive, and happiness follows it in life. If I have a problem, I think of something that would make me laugh; a laugh is always nice. Relationships can be created by having things in common. See, my dad and I don't always get along. When we laugh, everything else is silent; it sets the mood. If you didn't laugh around my dad, he would ask ""Do you got a sore sense of humor?"" Again, if you're not laughing with me at something funny, you must be an outsider. Laughter is positive, and positive energy is good. I laugh a lot; I laugh out loud. You would not have the relations you have today if it wasn't for laughter. Some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree with that statement. If it wasn't for laughter, I think that I would be very negative. I would be disciplined more, and I think I would be more distant with my dad. As I grow older, I see myself maturing; I laugh a lot less. My dad also sees the change; we have grown further apart, which is normal with every teenager growing up. My dad is very funny, and even though I'm glad to be growing up, I wouldn't trade the world for the humorous relations I have with my dad. Laughter is all around. I see people walking down the street laughing on their cell phone. I hear of the phrase ""Laugh all the way to the bank."" I would be laughing if I was rich too. Being rich is a positive thing, but if you are not laughing and happy in life, then money doesn't mean a thing. I could be poor and laughing and still be happy. If you are not happy in life, then everything you have or worked for means nothing. Laughter brings people together; there is no doubt. I've met many people by just simply ""laughing."" You will be surprised what you can get by just putting a smile on your face, or if you find something funny, ""laugh out."" I have a very humorous dad, and I would not change it. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I believe that everyone deserves a good laugh and to be happy. I think they deserve it. It's unfortunate not everyone is happy in life, so why don't you personally go out of your way and make someone laugh? You don't know their situation; it is nearly possible a laugh can take you many places. You never know what a laugh will bring you until you find out. Laughter is a strong element in relations and can base a personality profile of someone and who they are."
509	21351	8	3	Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1, @CAPS2, Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negatively, and then there are some that take it positively. I believe that those three words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car, the most expensive clothes, or the nicest physical appearance. I'm going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship.
510	21352	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner."
511	21354	8	3	I woke up at @NUM1 in the morning from a call from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to a cousin I have never met before. After we got off the phone, I quickly hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as I could. I threw on a random shirt and rushed around to tidy up a bit. Once they got to my house, I frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast, expecting some kind of friendly reaction from my new cousin, but the one I got wasn't what I expected. Right when I opened the door, he began cracking up laughing at me for a couple of minutes. I got kinda mad at him because I didn't know what he was laughing at, until I looked down and realized I had no pants on. I blushed deeply and rushed back into my room and put some shorts on. Then I came back into the living room while they were still on the couch laughing at my stupid mistake. I sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that I did it on purpose for a joke. They didn't believe me at all. I don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance. After they stopped laughing, my cousin asked me if that was the only thing I'd done like that. I replied no, and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like I did. That ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. It turns out that just because I made that dumb mistake, it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in. And just for that reason, we have had a good relationship since we met. In the end, I was glad I did that because it made us really close because we can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff. And that's my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and me.
512	21355	8	3	It was @NUM1 pm at night. I was watching @CAPS1.V when my dad said that he was going to the store. I wanted to go with him, but my mom said no because he was going to be back soon as he was only going to get a few things from the store. My dad said it was okay, so I went with him. On the way there, we saw a man on his bike. He didn't have much control on his bike. It looked like he was going to crash on one of the poles. We passed by him and looked back, and the man on the bike was on the ground. It was kind of funny, and me and my dad were laughing, but we stopped and helped the man up. He seemed a bit shaken but thanked us. At the store, me and my dad went separate ways. I went to the candy area and he went the other way. I was done looking at the candies, so I went to look for my dad. I couldn't find him anywhere at the store, so I went outside to look for him. The car wasn't there. I thought he went to the other store, so I went there, but he was not there. So I went back to the store to look again one more time. He was gone, so I started walking to my house. While I was walking, a car pulls over and asks me if I wanted a ride. I said no thanks. They insisted, but I told them once again that it was okay that I lived in the next block. They left, so I kept walking. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned back and it was a black tall shadow. I got really scared. I thought I was gonna get robbed. I kept walking faster and faster, then I started running. I turned back and the shadow was far behind me. A car passes me. I looked and it was my dad. I tried calling him, but he couldn't hear me. He was getting away, so I threw a rock at the car. My dad stopped immediately. I ran to it. My dad saw me and told me that he had forgotten that he took me with him. At the end, we both started laughing. We didn't tell my mom because she would get mad at my dad.
513	21356	8	3	"In all of the times, people have paid a lot of attention to laughter. We can't imagine our lives without @CAPS9. We laugh every day, make jokes, and smile. For me, laughter always was one of the best things in the world! @CAPS9 helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role. It all started @DATE1 in @DATE2. I was living in @LOCATION2 at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the @LOCATION2 for one @DATE1 as an exchange student. To do this, I had to pass a lot of tests, write countless essays, and go through all the paperwork... One of the things that I had to do was to talk to a group of other participants and two @CAPS1 for about one hour. So, the people who chose the kids to go abroad would look at how we could communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking a foreign language with a group of people who you have never seen before? No. Especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to @LOCATION1. You know that everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever will let others say something. But I still hoped everything would be fine. I remember that day as if it was yesterday. Everything in details. It was @DATE3 @TIME1 when I came into the big, white building of @ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was going to be. I came into the class and two @CAPS1 introduced us to each other. And at that exact moment, when I saw the other three people, at that exact second, I realized that I actually had to worry! I saw their faces. They thought the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. Big black shoes that looked like old army ones that my grandfather has, a black skirt that was longer than the girl, black ties, a dark t-shirt that was three or four sizes bigger than the girl; you can not even imagine how dark her short straight hair was. She looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the @DATE1. Another girl was a complete ""barbie girl"". You know, typical @CAPS3 - too good for everyone. She was tall, thin, with long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Bright - pink jeans, a light - pink top, and high heels. I remember her saying something to the girl in black. Also, there was one boy. He was a wonderful example of a rap person. All his look from shoes to attitude were just screaming about how much he liked rap. No, loved rap. Big blue jeans, cool @ORGANIZATION2 shoes from rap companies, a white tee - shirt with a face of a popular @LOCATION2 rap musician, a hoodoo, and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack, and I was able to hear music from his I - pod. Well, me, I was in new green pants, a grey top, a black cardigan, a nice grey purse, and black flats. I looked like a girl who loves style, I guess. I can not tell you what they thought about me. I just don't know. But I'm pretty sure that they thought I was a person who just reads magazines all the time and watches @CAPS6 fashion shows. So, we all looked super different from each other and seemed as if we were interested just in our own thing. And in nothing else. I didn't understand how we were able to be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were awkward. We did not know what to talk about since we all were so different. Two @CAPS1 who were making notes on how our conversation was going decided to help us. They gave us a random word, something like ""jungadzhumba"" and told us to think about what it is and to perform it. That seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others. The girl - in - black said that it was stupid. And then, the next second, the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about it. Yes, just a joke, and I don't even remember what it was. The only thing is that it was really funny. We started to laugh. And the laughter helped us. We were talking so long, more than one hour, but it seemed for us so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics, we were talking in that room, and then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home... It was a wonderful time! That day is very important for me now, because at that day I realized that laughter is a key for everything. I've heard it before, but the real understanding was at that @DATE3. Now my favorite phrase is: ""Laugh, if you don't know what to do, just laugh!"" It will help you."
514	21357	8	3	"Laughter is an amazing feeling. When people laugh, they feel good, they feel wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It is what brings the best out of people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor, and to show love. I am more of a depressed person, and my therapist always told me, ""You don't want wrinkles, so smile, and laugh it out."" I predict that laughing is what makes people who they really are. When people are mad, or even sad. What do they want to do? I don't think people would want to be grouchy all day. I would think people would want their friends or family to make them laugh, so they can get over what they're upset about, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love, and laughter. There is no love without laughter. No laughter without love. We need one another to keep our days going. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family problems, I'm a sophomore, yet I am still standing tall with a bright smile on my face. I know that everything will be all fine if I just laugh it out. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like I am needed in this world. I've been through so much that others look up to me. When it comes to that, I know exactly what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing. A lot of people have always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since middle school. And I tell them, ""Laugh it out. It makes you feel way better in the end."" I mean, you might feel silly when you're done laughing, but also feel great. That you can laugh, and move on. Because it is life. Nothing is perfect, things will get messed up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and be happy that he/she was once yours. Memories last forever, cherish every moment you have, laugh and live life as it is, because it is too short to waste time and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, some are very quiet, and giggly. I have a loud mouth. Also a loud laugh. I am very tiny, yet the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes people so surprised. I entertain people with my laugh. Depending on my mood, my laugh will change tone. Sometimes people can say my laugh is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so don't be afraid, speak out, and like text messages that people send to each other, laugh out loud. Everything will be okay. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a ""blonde,"" people say. No matter what, I'll always be laughing. In fourth grade my teacher once said, ""If you laugh a lot, you will live life longer."" I still remember it from then on, I still, and will believe in that quote. Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me become a better, and stronger person. The most common thing that people do is laugh. You can walk down the hall, in the mall, next door, outside, at a park, wherever else. There will always be people laughing, and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can speak through laughter."
515	21358	8	3	"Laughter is a powerful force. What do music, tears, and laughter have in common? They're all universal languages - they surpass any language barriers to get the point across without words. This was definitely the case the time my mom's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2. I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my mom announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my mom was encouraging. ""It will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""You'll learn some @CAPS6, and they'll learn some @CAPS7."" It was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when they arrived. As they pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I suddenly felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""Aunt"" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @PERSON3's rich voice"
516	21360	8	3	"One day my brother and I were at the bustling mall, aimlessly strolling around, looking for a cool hat to buy. My brother came up to me holding a stylish hat and asked if he should get it. I took a quick look and told him he shouldn't, so then he reluctantly put it back on the rack. Later on, we went our separate ways to look at a different store. I was at one trendy store while my brother was at another nearby. As I was carefully examining a pair of sunglasses and about to make a purchase, I suddenly felt a light tap on my shoulder. I looked back and saw a guy that was working at the last store we were at, flanked by two serious - looking cops. I was extremely curious why he was talking to me. He said to me sternly, ""hey where is the hat you stole from my store?"" ""I didn't steal a hat bro,"" I answered back firmly. ""Yes, you did, we got it on tape that you had the hat,"" said the guy confidently. ""Dude, I did not take a hat,"" I replied, my voice rising slightly. ""Okay. then what about your brother, where is he?"" questioned the guy. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me as I was still in the middle of making a purchase. At this point, I was pretty upset that my brother and I were wrongly accused of stealing a hat. The cops started to ask me some personal questions, like where I lived and what I did for fun. I told them I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what was happening. My dad was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing. My dad was asking me detailed questions of what happened, and I told him the truth of what happened. As the cop, my dad and I were walking back to the store to watch the film of the whole incident, we saw my brother walking back with the other cop. ""I'm good to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack,"" said my brother. I was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film, only bits and pieces of it. The guy apologized to my dad and I. I was still mad, because the guy didn't watch the whole film, and I didn't want the people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes. There is no reason to be mad about it as we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget about it. I think without our laughter about it, this situation could have been very different. Laughter makes experiences more fun as there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you are taking a bunch of weight off your shoulder and makes you relieved. I could have called the manager about how I felt, and what the guy did with the video, but I just forget about it and crack a few jokes to make myself laugh about it."
517	21361	8	3	"On a beautiful @DATE2, I woke up to a sight of a clear sky and the warm sun shining brightly through my window, which was quite unusual for a day in @DATE1. I got out of bed, as I usually do in a somewhat sleepy state. I ate my simple breakfast of cereal and milk, went to the bathroom, and carefully brushed my teeth. I left the house feeling a bit tired but overall in a great mood. As I walked to my bus stop, I watched people go by in a hurry, saying ""good - morning"" every now and then. When I got to my bus stop, there was no one there. I thought that maybe the bus had already come and picked the kids up. I waited and waited patiently. Almost fifteen minutes went by, and I was starting to get worried. If I had missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION1. My parents worked until the @TIME1 and there was no one to drive me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. There was no one there either. By that time, I was sure that the bus had come earlier and left me behind. I started to walk back to my house with a heavy heart. When I got there, I opened the door and went straight to check the @ORGANIZATION1 calender hanging on the wall. There was nothing written on @DATE3. It was a normal @ORGANIZATION1 day. How could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to ask myself of other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed. That wasn't possible because the weather was great. Maybe something happened to the bus, like an accident and it couldn't come, but that wasn't it either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about it, the less it made sense to me. What was going on that day? I got frustrated. I set my backpack down so that I could look for my daily planner. I opened it up and searched for the @ORGANIZATION1's phone number. Then, I took the phone and called the @ORGANIZATION1. ""You've reached @ORGANIZATION1,"" a woman on the phone said. ""How may I help you?"" ""Yes, I'm a student there and I was wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today?"" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman didn't answer me. This was making me angry. ""Hello, are you still there?"" I asked, with anger showing through my voice. Nothing. Then, the woman started laughing. She laughed for almost a minute. This had made me mad. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? ""Was there something that I said?"" I asked. ""No, no, I'm so sorry,"" she said, trying to keep herself from laughing. ""No, it's just that, do you know what day is today?"" ""It's @DATE3, isn't it?"" She laughed again. ""No, today isn't @DATE3, it's @DATE2."" I was shocked to hear that. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility that I hadn't thought of was that it was @DATE2. I felt like an idiot. I set down the phone and started to laugh. I laughed and laughed like I hadn't in years. Laughter finally made me forget about the earlier frustration, and I realized it was just a silly mistake."
518	21364	8	3	"Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something silly, at something comical, about someone's funny behavior, at someone's ridiculous antics, a funny event like a prank, a funny face someone makes, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life. I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh heartily. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step - mom, @CAPS1. We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide in shock. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The football hits the grass, as do all of us. We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together. My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reach out through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You - tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you - tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing a crazy game of @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you - tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co - workers who shared it with their family and friends. They all laughed. Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1. Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the playground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughter that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one. Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do, too, and that you can find more moments of laughter in your own life."
519	21365	8	3	"People say ""laughter can cure anything"", and you know what, I totally believe it to. There has been multiple times when I was sad or angry that someone made me laugh, and I have made almost everyone I know laugh when they were down or frustrated. Now, many people have made me laugh throughout my whole sixteen years that I have been alive. To be completely honest, I only really remember one moment in my life that really, laughter was all I needed to pull me back to reality. My best friend @PERSON2 really knew what I needed to help me out. Her humor made my life real again, and because of it I was able to accept life. It was @DATE1, when I got really upset because I knew that the guy I loved since seventh grade wouldn't date me again. His reason for this was because he didn't want to ruin our great and close friendship. Just because he said that didn't mean I would just give up. I tried hard to win him back, but it just seemed like nothing was working. At this point I knew I needed to talk to my best friend, so I text - ed @PERSON2. I told her how I was doing, and how none of it was working. If you knew @PERSON2, you would know that she sees a bright side to anything. @PERSON2 told me at that time, ""@PERSON1, you can have any guy in the world, and yet, you can't seem to realize it. I don't know about you, but you must be really lovesick!"" She said that once or twice because she knew it was true. I still just couldn't accept what she was telling me. That never stopped me from smiling or laughing though. I'll admit those words really dried my tears up and helped me move forward. Now it is @DATE2 time, school is out, and it's time for me to step my game up. I was still trying to win @PERSON3, the love of my life back. Once again I tried hard! I even asked @PERSON2 to ask @PERSON3 if he still had feelings for me. He never gave her an answer. When I asked @PERSON2 for more advice, she responded like usual. ""@PERSON1, @PERSON3 is just one guy, there are plenty of guys out there for you. You just need to look and stop trying for just one guy"". This got me thinking. And she is totally right, I just need to find a guy that makes me feel the same way @PERSON3 makes me feel. Don't get me wrong though, even though @PERSON2 was trying to be serious, I couldn't help but smile a little, and giggle. As I was giggling, I thought to myself. I still love @PERSON3 like crazy. It's the beginning of @DATE2, and I am just relaxing at my house like usual, when I get a text from @PERSON3 saying he might be moving to @LOCATION1. I just started bawling like a baby who is hungry. I quickly text - ed @PERSON2 to tell her, but she already knew. I had one more plan to win @PERSON3 back, and I told @PERSON2 all about it. My plan is to ask @PERSON3 if he wants to hike @CAPS4. Pisqah with me before he moves. When we hiked all the way to the top I am going to tell him how I truly still feel about him, then I am going to kiss him. When @PERSON2 read this, her first response was, ""Well shoot girly, aren't you just a spitball of love and romance!"" I almost peed my pants when I read that. It was hysterical! My plan never happened because @PERSON3 ended up not moving thankfully. Quintin and I still haven't got back together, but I am fine with"
520	21366	8	3	"I slowly got up and watched as paint dripped off my face, my hair and clothes. A trail of paint followed me as I tried to hop from one clear spot on the floor to the next, but there weren't many clear spots. All that I could think of, was if I was going to make @CAPS5 to high school, or not. Trying my hardest not to get anymore paint on the ground, I opened the door carefully, and called out. ""@CAPS1...Hey mom?"" I yelled half-halfheartedly, as I glanced back at the ""painted"" room.  ""@CAPS2?"" she hollered back up the stairs.My mouth wouldn't open, I was afraid to answer. I've messed up millions of times, but none have been this bad.  ""@CAPS3, you see... I've had a paint withdraw from the paint pan."" I replied softly, hoping she would not hear me.  ""A paint withdraw?"" she asked in a confused tone, as she walked up the stairs to see what has happened. I closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner.My mind raced as I tried to prepare myself for a rant about how I have to be more careful, and punishment. Neither came. She started to crack up.  I was @CAPS8 confused at the sight of my mom sitting on the floor, almost peeing her pants. I then realized that I was probably a sight to see. I was covered in paint from head to toe. I started to giggle as I took in the situation, only something like this would happen to me. Minutes later we finial got a hold of ourselves and mom went to go get some paper towels to clean up my mess.  She came back upstairs carrying a role of paper towels and a plastic garbage bags.""@CAPS4 thing I put the plastic covering over everything, before I let you paint."" she stated, smiling at me. ""@CAPS5 would have been way worse, if I spilled the paint all over the carpet."" I replied, returning her smile. I started to gather up the plastic covering, revealing the unsoiled carpet. The garbage-can was as full as a stuffed @LOCATION1 on @CAPS6. After we gathered up the last of the plastic covering, I slammed the garbage-cans lid as I put the last bit of plastic covering in. My mom came in carrying @CAPS7, and a handful of paper-towels.  ""@CAPS8 what made the paint pan have sudden withdraw of paint, @CAPS9?, @CAPS10 you trip on the plastic covering, or drop the paintbrush in the pan?"" she questioned me, as she gave me a confused facial expression.  I didn't know what to say. "" I...@CAPS1, @CAPS3, I was on my way to paint the edges against the ceiling, when I took my first step on the ladder and slipped. Landing in the paint pan and receiving the paintbrush in my face"" I didn't mention the fact that I tripped on my shoelace. My mom always got on me, for leaving my shoes untied. My mom started to laugh uncontrollably again. She started to turn beat-red. I could not believe her reaction. The situation was @CAPS8 funny, I started to laugh again as-@CAPS3. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined anyone forgiving me in such a big way.  Once we finally stopped laughing, my mom and I finished cleaning the mess. My mom and I remember this day as a time we got to bond. I now realize that my mom will understand, and forgive me for my mistakes, no matter how big they are. "
521	21367	8	3	"@CAPS1 @CAPS2   @CAPS3 entering the school's office was a usual thing for me. I was only in elementary school and had already developed the habit of feigning illness ""so I could go home. It had worked several @CAPS2 times, but the reality was that somehow adults could outsmart ""my sickness"". As a kid, I was a perfect actor, but apparently my acting skills were fading. All the staff knew me by then, and by now it was harder for me to find my way out. I remember being in fourth grade when I made an appearance at the office, not really by choice, and in my innocence, I never knew what could happen next. My cousin @PERSON2 and I were in the same classes. We used to look alike when we were kids, and teachers would often confuse who we were because we looked like twins. One day, my cousin was struggling with a couple of math problems, and @PERSON1, our math teacher, decided to stay a few minutes after school to help her. However, we also used to ride the same bus, and I decided to wait for her to catch the bus together. Those few minutes turned into more, and once @PERSON2 was out, we had already missed the bus. That's when we made our appearance in the office, and there she was, the chunky old lady who knew me well. I would always remember her sitting in a chair in front of the computer, filling out some papers. This time, she knew it wasn't one of those ""wanna go home"" days. ""We missed the bus,"" we said. She then asked us why, and we both gave our explanations. In the meantime, she called @PERSON1 to make sure we were telling the truth. When @PERSON1 showed up, the office lady explained what we had said, but the problem was that she confused our explanations, thinking we both missed the bus for the same reason, making me look like a liar. When @PERSON1 heard this, she said that I wasn't telling the truth. When I tried to explain to her that the lady had been mistaken, it was no use. Even my cousin tried to defend me, but the office lady said she was sure of what I had said. Being a kid and all, I felt ashamed, even though I knew I was telling the truth. Mrs. @PERSON1 decided to give me a demerit, but deep inside, I knew I had told the truth, and that's what matters. As a kid, it seems like the end of the world in these situations. I felt angry because I wasn't able to do anything about it, but now that I look back, it brings a smile to my face. In my poor judgment back then, I could just think of the teacher as being mean, but now I see that it was just a big misunderstanding. Now, around @NUM1 years have passed, and this memory is still with me, but I only take the best from it. When I hang out with my cousin @PERSON2, the basis of our conversations are these funny moments of our childhood that only bring laughter. Just remembering the foolish things we did when we were young. Sharing these moments brings us closer, not only as a family but also as friends, and there is no better thing than enjoying moments of long - lasting laughter with the people we love."
522	21369	8	3	I think that laughter is the key. Being happy is a big part of life because being happy feels so good. If I were in a relationship that was not happy, I would not like it at all. In a happy relationship, laughter is bound to come. The first thing I do when I meet someone is always smiling and telling jokes. If I tell jokes and they laugh, they know that I am a happy person. Whether it's a grown - up, a friend, or someone I want to date, people will always enjoy laughter. Let's say me and my girlfriend. When I first saw her, she was sitting at a desk in my history class, crying. I asked if she was okay, and she told me her story. After she told me her story, I told her how I understood her feelings and then told her a joke, and she laughed. After she finished laughing, she asked me for my phone number, and that night, we started dating. I asked her what she liked about me, and she said it was the way I made her laugh. I always love to make my family and friends laugh because when they smile, it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and myself. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy, it would be a better place. I'd rather laugh and be happy than be mad or sad about something. When I was growing up, I was alone most of the time, so I had to learn how to keep myself happy. I would think about funny things I had seen or said in the past and try to make a story out of it, and it worked. When I got older, I started doing stand - up comedy. It made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh. After the show, seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on their faces was a night I will never forget. If I had to choose what I'd want to do for fun, I'd be a comedian. Thank you for reading this, and have a nice day.
523	21370	8	3	My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past tragedies, future mishaps, and current mistakes—loss. Life is a puzzle I can't figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I dive into life. I isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear - soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile can go a long way, perhaps too long. It sends the wrong message to those who can't tell if the mask is real or perfectly put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter fades, my smile droops, and my lips begin to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding and being squeezed at the same time. My eyes become moist, they start to sting, and redden as if infected. Don't ask me if I'm okay, offer to do anything for me, or hug me. It will only push me to break down, which is unacceptable. Peace is the only thing I need at the moment, and of course, my best friend, tissue. In these tough times, I hope that one day, this mask will no longer be necessary, and I can truly smile from the heart.
524	21373	8	3	"In the ninth grade, I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am terrible at giving speeches. Before speeches, my hands get clammy and cold, I experience ""hot flashes,"" and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches, my eyes frantically glance around the room, and my breathing pattern changes to quick, short breaths, almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches, I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I don't speak, I don't laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, @CAPS4 speech was different. My @CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer. So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room, nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting during ""speech - giving time,"" (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other), the classroom was focused on me. Today, @CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me, no matter what I really had to say and how professional @CAPS5 came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @CAPS5 up (@CAPS2't that what advertisement is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today, I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets, and there was a cardboard box around @CAPS5 to serve as a television. @CAPS4 also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets, and all they heard were the voices of the ""actors."" After the first few lines of the speech, my group of classroom peers laughed. @CAPS4 was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi - large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches, people laugh, but usually it's a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. @CAPS5's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, turning it into just an introduction and an ending, with no body. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of @CAPS4 laughter encouraged me to continue with my speech. At the end of my speech, everyone clapped. They always clap. @CAPS5 is required to clap. @CAPS4 clap was different. @CAPS5 was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said ""@CAPS4 speech had a clear purpose and made the audience want to keep listening."" @CAPS5 was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and they had understood @CAPS5, and maybe they would now want to read the book. @CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying. @CAPS4 was a definite improvement and also a factor in why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had an introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually, I get so nervous that I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel, and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can affect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting, and it showed me that I could overcome my fear of public speaking."
525	21374	8	3	"In @LOCATION1, there was a small boy, @ORGANIZATION1, who didn't have much ambition in life. He was taunted and teased to the point where he would just hide away in his house and not talk to anyone. The other boys at school would laugh at @ORGANIZATION1 for being so much smaller than themselves. He was never the fastest, strongest, or coolest, but he was the smartest. He knew how to twist and turn any phrase to make himself feel superior to others. In truth, @ORGANIZATION1 was lonely. He had never laughed whole - heartedly or felt the gentle touch of a lover. He wished dearly that he could be more outgoing so that a girl would fall in love with him. There was in fact a girl he had his eye on for months. Her name was @PERSON1. She was the most beautiful girl he had ever laid eyes on. He had followed her all over town and rode his bicycle past her almost every day when she was with her friend @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 hated @CAPS1 because he got to be with @PERSON1 every day, hold her, and talk to her. @ORGANIZATION1 had envied @CAPS1 for around four months before he messaged her on a website called ""myyeabook,"" a place to meet new people and make friends. @ORGANIZATION1 sent her a friend request and asked for her digits, hoping she would find him attractive and let him text her. @PERSON1 accepted his request and sent him a message saying ""@CAPS4 I see you're from the town next to mine. We should hang out sometime. It would be cool."" @ORGANIZATION1 almost lost it when he read this. He went and got a haircut and new clothes so that she would think he was attractive and cool. @PERSON1 went to the park with her friend @PERSON2 and waited for this fellow named @ORGANIZATION1. She and @PERSON2 played on the swings and spun each other on the spinning wheel. @ORGANIZATION1 had been riding his bike and set it down a hundred yards away from where they were. He walked over, said ""@CAPS4."" to @PERSON2, and then walked over to @LOCATION2. He told her he thought she was beautiful and had an amazing smile. @PERSON1 blushed and asked him if he wanted to swing for a while. @PERSON2 took off home, seeing that @PERSON1 was going to be okay with this guy. Little did they know, they were made for each other. @ORGANIZATION1 let his guard down and told her some jokes. He laid out his life story almost completely with her. He was so comfortable around her, and he didn't know why. @PERSON1 felt the same way. She laughed at his jokes and told him her life story. In this one short meeting, they connected on a level far beyond their ages"
526	21375	8	3	Moving schools is never easy, especially for a fourth grader. I had been dreading going back to a new school all summer and the day had finally arrived. My mom reassured me as I reluctantly walked onto the bus. As I scanned the seats it became apparent to me that I needed to try to make new friends or live out my fourth grade career a loner. The bus ride was a quiet one, I did not talk to anyone nor did they talk to me. The school day started like any other. First the teacher assigned everyone their seats in groups of two, I sat by a boy named Jake. At first I thought my school life would remain a solo one, I wasn't sure what my seating partner's problem was but no words were being exchanged. The rest of the day went by rather fast, before I knew it it was over. I had made it through my first day of school. The bus ride home was not much different than the ride to school, as I got off the bus at my house my mother was there to ask how my day went. After telling her all about it she said that I should try to just be myself and eventually I would make friends. It was Monday, I got up that morning with a sense of new found motivation. I got ready for the day and waited at my bus stop, I kept waiting for almost a half hour before I went to my mom. After phoning the school we discovered that my bus had been in a minor accident so I had to be driven to school that day. My mom was surprised but told me to get into the car and she would take me to school, just as we were pulling out of our driveway I noticed Jake, my seating partner, was waiting at his bus stop oblivious to what had happened. Screeching to a halt my mom rolled down her window to ask him if he wanted a ride. At first he seemed unsure but he took us up on the offer. The car ride was spent in silence, listening to the radio. We made it to school and me and Jake start walking to class. I don't know what got into me but I felt like running down the sidewalk to our classroom. Sprinting down the sidewalk while Jake is watching, I almost made it to class until one of the teachers decided to open their door. At full speed I ran head first into the door and fell backwards onto the sidewalk. After rubbing a major bump on my head I turn around to see Jake laughing hysterically. I got somewhat mad at first until I thought about it, and it was probably funny to the onlookers. Scraping myself off the cement I walk over to Jake, We laugh about the incident and head to class. That day we spent the entire class talking, even getting into trouble a time or two. Ever since that day Jake has been a good friend of mine, it's been eight years since we met and there is no end in sight. Overall in my opinion laughter is an important part of daily life, and a great way to make friends.
527	21377	8	3	When I was young me and my friends would play at Mike's Lake. Mike's Lake was a lake in the middle of an orchard, there was a slide, diving board, and two rope swings. All summer long we would sit, play, swim, and laugh down at the lake. We would have our end - of - school day party, and celebrate the arrival of summer down at the lake. There is one day I can remember so well that it's like it was yesterday. The last day of school had just ended, my friends and I got on the bus as fast as we could. When the bus stopped at the lake we all started running and stripping down to our swim trunks. I was the first one in, as a result I was the first one to realize the water was as cold as the river, it felt like a thousand little nettles stabbing me over and over again. My friends described me as a bouncy ball because I got out as fast as I got in. As soon as my friends saw my blue lips they all started laughing so hard that some of them fell into the freezing water themselves. After that we walked up to Mike's house and asked him to turn on the generator, after about an hour the lake was warm enough to swim in. After we all had swam around for a bit we decided to go on the rope swing. After a while we started doing back flips, when we stopped our backs and chests were as red as the apples in the orchard, and our throats hurt from laughter. As well as being sore from hitting the water over and over again, we were also hungry so we fired up the grill and started making burgers. When the first and second batches resembled a mound of coal, we decided to order pizza. We spent the time by playing airsoft, when the pizza arrived the lake had thousands of airsoft pellets floating in it. As we ate we sat on the small dock and stuck our legs in and collected whatever pellets came near. Soon after eating we started playing hide and seek in the orchard. After ten or so rounds we were all scraped up by running through the trees, so of course we poured soda on our cuts, to this day I still wonder why we did that because it really hurt. Once we were done being stupid we laughed at ourselves, then we laughed at each other. It wasn't long before we played swimming baseball, the bases were the corners of the docks and the pitcher was on the floating platform. We used floating balls and swam from base to base. Eventually the sun started to set and we made a fire by the side of the lake and roasted marshmallows over it. When our parents came to get us we were in the middle of a belly - flop contest. Before we left we promised that we would never forget that day, and that we would be friends forever and laughter would always be the glue. That night I stayed up all night thinking of all the fun and all the laughs we had that day, it was definitely the start of one of the best and one of the most memorable summers of my life.
528	21379	8	3	It was Memorial Day of 2015, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great day to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in our small town, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and what's a better way for that to happen than being in a parade? I was with my best friend Bailey and her family. Their float was for the local ice - cream parlor. Which is the ice - cream parlor that they had owned at the time. We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only Bailey, Bailey's mom, and the manager of the ice - cream parlor to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float. Bailey and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin babies. I can't remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well - behaved babies, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed too hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly. We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while Bailey and I had started to get tired from holding the babies and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though. The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail. Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the babies. At the time I was holding the girl and Bailey was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The babies were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had. The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beet red. Bailey's mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the babies off to the ice - cream parlor manager who was there. Then Bailey's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time Bailey even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore. At the end of the parade Bailey's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle Mark's kids, Jake and Lily, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa Tom had asked if we were okay. When he asked that Bailey and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that. That day was a good day for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at ourselves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens it's best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. Bailey and I have made a fool of ourselves many times ever since, and laughing at ourselves had made us much closer. Every relationship whether it's intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will affect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives.
529	21380	8	3	When I was fourteen years old I think my family and I started riding four - wheelers out in the sand. My parents' friends are the ones who got us started riding. The first time I went out there I had a 50cc four - wheeler and I couldn't stop laughing because it was so small and everybody had big four - wheelers and dirt bikes, but riding out there with that thing was fun and my family would laugh every time my brother rode it up a hill because he would just ride the heck out of that thing. After that ride we sold my four - wheeler and got a 250cc four - wheeler. It's the first time going to the dunes with my new four - wheeler and I can't wait. We get to the dunes, unload everything, get our riding gear on and our helmets with our goggles on. It was thirty minutes of riding and my brother was jumping his four - wheeler when some people showed up and were video - taping him, which made him show off a little bit. So he was jumping in front of those people going further and further every time. My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing because he was showing up everybody there who was trying to out - jump him. So when he got done jumping the guys who were video - taping him came up to us and they told us that he is really good and that we should follow them to another jump. So my brother, trying to be cool, whipped his bike around and wrecked it. It was funny, my dad and I were laughing so hard our eyes were tearing up but lucky for him my dad and I were the only ones to see his little crash. So we went to go see if he's okay and he said yeah so we took off. My brother and I were right behind them and our parents were nowhere in sight. I turned my head to look and see if they were behind us and when I looked ahead of me all I see is a roost of sand in my face, which made me turn my handlebars so I hit a grass mound and the bike flew up in the air, rolled off a little hill and landed on my leg. My brother didn't know he did that to me so I was stranded until my parents came. I don't know why but I couldn't stop laughing because believe it or not that wreck was actually kinda fun and funny because no matter what I did I couldn't seem to get that four - wheeler off my leg. About ten minutes passed by with my four - wheeler on my leg and I finally heard a loud noise, it was my dad and he came to save me. So I told him what happened and he couldn't stop laughing at me. He told me he would get my brother back. So when we were on our way back to the truck my brother was behind my dad and my dad roosted him with sand so bad it made his goggles fall off! My parents and I couldn't stop laughing and we ended up pulling over so we could stop laughing at my brother. After that my brother doesn't roost me anymore. It's been a year since we have started riding and still my brother has not yet roosted me. He still tends to show off. This one time my mom's friends came out and my brother was trying to be cool and ride really fast from coming out of the dunes and he slid on the concrete and he wrecked in front of us and maybe like seven people, it was hilarious everybody was laughing besides my mom. He looked at his arm and he had road rash all down his arm. Well I guess that's what he gets for trying to show off. It's like every time he tries to show off he wrecks, so why does he keep doing it? I don
530	21382	8	3	"Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away."
531	21383	8	3	"Many things are said to bring people together. These things can vary from favorite foods—such as the delicious pizza with a thin crust and a medley of toppings, like pepperoni, mushrooms, and bell peppers—to fashion taste, whether it's the trendy street - wear style or the classic elegant look, or even disliking the same people, but nothing can bring two people as close as a good laugh can. Laughing will always lighten the mood, bring out a winning smile that shows off one's pearly whites and from time to time, a tear to the eye. Laughing makes the bad days, like those filled with endless assignments and stressful exams, manageable and the great days, such as a sunny day at the beach, fantastic. In my perspective, the world wouldn't go around without a good laugh every now and then. By 'good laugh', I don't mean the kind that makes you happy for a moment, I mean the kind that brings tears to your eyes and creates a shaking feeling in your stomach. The kind of laugh that you remember. I've had many of those moments, but one that I cherish most just happened to occur during a school day. A couple weeks ago I was having a pretty nice day, sure it's winter so the cold and damp weather dampened my spirits a little, but I was doing alright. I had my normal classes, like math with its complex equations and history with its long - ago stories, got my average homework load, and then it came time for study hall. Study hall is basically study hall at my school. I sit at a round table in there with a few of my friends and we talk about nearly everything. Everyday, I sit by Sarah. Sarah and I occasionally sit and talk with everyone else, but we tend to disengage ourselves from the others and lock ourselves in our own private world of inside jokes, smart - ass laughs and people watching. So that day during study hall, I can't quite recall what we were talking about at our table, we all just couldn't keep ourselves from laughing. Most of the laughing was just giggles, and some of it was straight up, hardcore red - faced laughing. After we all settled down from the most recent up - roar of chuckling, Sarah started talking. She somehow spit out the words, ""Stop it you guys! You're making my eyes hurt!"" amongst the giggles still blossoming out of her mouth. After she said that, I became puzzled. I just stared at her and stuttered, ""...what?"". I was sure she made a mistake and said eyes instead of stomach, but after she replied with ""Don't your eyes hurt when you laugh really hard?!"" I lost control. I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe and I felt like I was going to pee! See, the funny part is, Sarah is nearsighted. So the idea of her eyes hurting from laughing really hard is just uncontrollably funny. After Sarah and I caught our breath, we asked other classmates around the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh and guess what? They did! This only made us laugh harder. This occasion instantly became another inside joke we treasure. That inside joke is by far one of the funniest ones, and it being funny, just makes it funnier! Everytime she laughs I ask, ""Do your eyes hurt?"" and we just burst into more laughter. The idea of the joke alone brings a smile to my face, that being the reason why laughing is such a big part in our world. It brings happiness, joy and love. Well, actually it brings just about every positive emotion. I may not be a doctor yet, but I know I'm right when I say; everyone should get their daily dose of laughter. Laughter can cure just about anything."
532	21384	8	3	It was the Friday and my friend Lily was going to come home with me. We talked about our plans for the week all Friday at school. Some of our ideas that we had thought up included going to a movie, like that new action - packed superhero movie that everyone was talking about, hanging out at my house and doing our nails while telling stories, or going on an adventure around my neighborhood, maybe exploring that old, abandoned shed at the end of the street. At lunch that Friday we decided on trying to do all of the ideas because we had the whole weekend days to hang out. After lunch we went to our next two classes and the classes seemed to go by really slow. The math class with its difficult trigonometry problems and the science class with its boring lecture on the water cycle just dragged on. Finally the last bell of the day rang and Lily and I ran to our locker to meet up and get all of our stuff to go home.  We went outside the front doors of the school and waited on the front steps for my mom. We waited for twenty minutes when we remembered that my mom told me that we would have to walk home after school because she had to work late. Lily and I looked over at each other and started laughing, because we had totally forgotten about having to walk home. Finally we stopped laughing and got up to walk home. On our way home we had my i - pod out and the volume turned to max so we could listen to music and dance around. We were singing along to our favorite pop songs as we swayed and twirled. We finally made it home and dropped all of our stuff off and got something to drink, like a cold glass of lemonade.  On our way to my moms work, we stopped at the local gas station to get something to eat, like a couple of chocolate bars and a bag of chips. We left the gas station and continued to my moms work. On the way to the bank where my mom works we came across a dog chasing a squirrel. The dog was running so fast that the fur on its face was pushed back and it looked like it was going to rip off. The squirrel ran up a tree that was nearby, but the dog didn't realize that he couldn't climb the trunk and ended up running head - first into the tree. Lily and I started laughing at the dog because it stumbled around for a few minutes and then decided to sit down and just bark at the tree. We left the dog and squirrel and continued to the bank. We arrived at the bank twenty minutes later and talked to my mom. She gave us money to go buy a coffee and then she told us to go back home. On our way home we stopped at Starbucks and got coffee.   On our way back to my house from Starbucks we watched the people drive by and laughed at all the people singing in their cars while stopped at the light. Some were singing off - key and making all sorts of funny faces. We arrived back at my house and decided to put a movie in. We watched Minions and ate popcorn. Any time the little yellow people came into the movie we laughed because we both thought they were cute. After the movie my parents got home, and we had pizza and ice - cream for dinner. After dinner we played the wii and then fell asleep. The next Saturday when we woke up my dad made us pancakes and eggs for breakfast. After breakfast we got ready to go and my mom took us to the mall. At the mall my mom told Lily and I to meet her back at food court around two. We left my mom and headed to the first store. While we were walking to one of the store we saw a guy with a mohawk and a green beard. We looked at each other and started laughing because his beard looked like a Christmas tree tipped over. At two - o'clock we left to go back to food court to meet up with my mom. She bought us ice - cream and told us that if we left now we could go see a movie. We decided to stay for one more hour and then we left to go home. On our way home we danced around in the backseat and sang to all of the songs that we knew.  When we arrived home we played the wii until my dad got there. After my dad got home we ate dinner and then played the wii again. This time when we played the wii we got my parents to play too. Whenever it was my moms turn we would laugh because of how she would set herself up to bowl. After we finished playing the wii Lily and I went into my room and talked about all of the guys that we liked. We laughed at some of our choices because of the reasons that we liked them. We talked for about two hours and then fell asleep. The next Sunday we woke up and had eggs and toast for breakfast. After breakfast Lily got dressed to go home. After she left we talked over text about all the fun we had, and how we couldn't wait for tomorrow.
533	21385	8	3	"All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers, like those summer nights at the beach with bonfires and music. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day - to - day frustrations, like getting a bad grade on a test, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend Emily has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile - long gravel drive away from the candy - apple red paint on her Mustang. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, Tom and Jake, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but Emily never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, Jake became fed up and said that he could probably run faster than Emily was driving. Emily decided to take him up on the offer, stopped her car, and Jake proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon he was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, he soon changed his mind and since the car was going slow enough, he climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from Emily's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when Emily realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. Jake slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed him forward at a trot. He slid on the gravel road, landed on his rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at him for the few seconds he remained sitting. He then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and Jake could have been hurt. But he wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""Hey, I'm having fun."" While crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun. Laughter truly enriches our lives and makes our friendships stronger."
534	21386	8	3	"During the spring of the sixth grade, my parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at my best friend Lily's house.   ""Honey, your father,"" my mom said through the phone to me.   ""What mom, what's going on?"" I asked her.   ""I need to come home, I've been served today with divorce papers."" my mom told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell up in my eyes. I had no clue what was happening, I was only eleven and vaguely knew what divorce was. Without saying a word to her, I hung up the phone and ran into Lily's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to what extent.   I stayed at Lily's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see my mom or my father. At night I dreamt about what my sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered what my father was doing, where my mom was, and whether or not my sisters were okay. Even though I knew I"
535	21387	8	3	"@CAPS10 you laughed today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives. @CAPS10 you heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine."" @CAPS1 comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @CAPS2. Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you @MONTH1 not know yet. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" is accurate in my opinion. I relate @CAPS1 to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice, and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy. When I was younger my best friends name was @PERSON1, and we hung out nearly everyday after school. We shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had. Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @CAPS1 was just the other day though @CAPS1 was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today @PERSON1 was going to get to come home with me and my @CAPS3. My @CAPS3 knew she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @CAPS1 was around lunch time and my @CAPS3 thought, well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick @CAPS1 up on the way home. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ORGANIZATION1's (a local @CAPS6 restaurant) for a @CAPS7 lunch.  When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @CAPS1 would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @CAPS1 came to our table I was really excited and I started to drink @CAPS1 really fast. maybe a little too fast. When all of the sudden ""whoosh"" @CAPS1 had spilled all over my face and clothes, @CAPS1 was everywhere, in my hair, on my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that I started crying right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked over my @CAPS3 was laughing too I was humiliated. I was so worried my friend and my @CAPS3 would make fun of me being so clumsy, but they both said that @CAPS1 has happened to them too.  After I got cleaned up I realized how silly I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me. But when I thought about @CAPS1 I would @CAPS10 laughed too. The whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we would both think about @CAPS1 and start cracking up again.   Even though at first I though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident, we ended up laughing together and @CAPS1 made us closer as friends. Our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us. We were and always will be great friends. We are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again.  I do believe laughter is the best medicine. Although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers I think @CAPS1 makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and @CAPS10 a positive outlook, if you @CAPS10 something to look forward too, something you don't want to miss. Laughter can make a sick person forget about their illness, @CAPS1 can make them carefree and living in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than we realize. So consider this question instead: @CAPS10 you made someone laugh today?"
536	21388	8	3	Its often said that laughing is an essential and wonderful part of life. It's also commonly stated that it's healthy to have a good chuckle here and there. It's truly true that laughing is beneficial as it makes everyone a better - natured person. Spontaneous laughter can lighten the mood and bring joy, making life more pleasant. All in all, laughter is a precious aspect of our existence that enriches our daily lives.
537	21389	8	3	Family trip @CAPS1 on the @DATE1, my family and I decided to embark on a trip to @LOCATION2. My father, who had recently woken up from a coma, was deeply in a state of depression. The doctor advised my mother that she should start planning family activities and do some things during the @DATE1 break. I was twelve years old at that time, and I keenly noticed how my father was struggling to cope with the fact that he had lost both of his arms. He tried his best to hide the fact that it was overwhelming for him to handle, but that only made us more worried about his well - being. My mother, along with my sister @CAPS2 and I, decided to go out on a trip to distract my father and hopefully lift him out of his depression. On the day of the trip, we headed out at about @NUM1 am from the apartments. My mother was the kind of person who would always be punctually early for anything. Overnight, we had carefully packed our bags and already loaded the stuff into the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I carefully helped my father, as there was no way for him to keep himself balanced, while going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to get my sisters excited, and they kept chatting with my father in the car. A few hours later, one by one, my sisters started dozing off, and then my father also started sleeping. My mother was starting to feel drowsy, so I stayed awake and began talking to her about random topics. As I kept her company, she began sharing stories about her childhood, like the hearty laughs she would have when her cousins played pranks on one another. Some of the stories were so hilarious that we tried hard not to wake everyone up with our laughter. Even though she had endured a rough childhood, her cousin @PERSON2 was always the one who knew exactly how to make her laugh. My father and sisters woke up and started feeling carsick, so my mother ended up exiting towards @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. As we began searching for a gas station, we started to hear loud music, and as we got closer, we noticed that there was a lively carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @CAPS2, who was @NUM2 - years - old at the time, began complaining, along with @PERSON1, who was eight - years - old. I tried to persuade my parents, and my mother agreed, but my father only got angry. That was until my sister @CAPS4, who was @NUM3 - years - old, started ranting non - stop, until my father finally gave in. My mother parked the car at the nearby park, and my sisters ran ahead of us towards the carnival. My mother tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. As we arrived at the carnival, we saw stands filled with beautiful jewelry, trendy clothing, and other small items. We kept walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing gracefully on stage. Later on, a funny comedian went up on stage and made everyone in the audience burst into laughter. After watching the gypsies and the comedian, we started exploring around. We ended up buying three @CAPS5 parasols, and the fourth parasol was free. We thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade. The @DATE1 heat was getting increasingly intense, so we headed towards the car. As we reached the car, my mother's face turned pale; she had left the car keys inside. She began arguing with me, and I started regretting the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My father finally interrupted by saying that he was going to search for a wire hanger from one of the stands in the carnival. As he left with my sister @PERSON1, the rest of us began walking towards the park. @CAPS4 started pouting, and my mother kept blaming me for locking the car, while I pretended I couldn't hear her. After my father came back with a wire hanger, I began straightening it out and bending one side to create a hook. After many attempts, I still couldn't open the car, and my arms started to ache. An old couple riding on a motorcycle parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My father told them we had left the keys inside the car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we got inside the car. We decided to head home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed, we enjoyed the trip, and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mother and sisters started joking around, and for the first time since coming out of the hospital, my father began laughing. This trip, despite the setbacks, ended up being a memorable and heart - warming experience for our family.
538	21390	8	3	"I think laughter is extremely good for relationships, and here is the reason why. When I first arrived at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I was trying my best to be myself and make friends. One day, I was in class, and @CAPS4 walked into my classroom and came straight up to me. She started chatting with me, and I started laughing. Then she told me that she liked my laugh, so she started mimicking my laugh. I felt good knowing that she wasn't making fun of my laugh but was truly enjoying it. She was trying to get me to laugh because she thought my laugh was funny since she had never heard anyone laugh like that before. Everyone has a distinct laugh; I have two laughs, which she found amusing. That day, @CAPS5, was the best day of my life because I was being my genuine self, and I knew she wasn't laughing at me in a negative way. Every time she hears me laugh, she starts laughing and tries to make me laugh so that we can all have a great time. For me, @CAPS5 is funny because a lot of people don't pay attention to how others laugh. I feel good that she noticed and liked my laugh and wanted to have a good time with me. Most people, when they make fun of someone, say hurtful things, but @CAPS4 wanted to make me laugh again. I know she wasn't making fun of me. She just thought my laugh was unique and funny, not in a ""haha, you are weird"" kind of way, but more like ""omg, I love your laugh, it's cute and funny."" Now, every time she sees me, she tries to make me laugh, and it makes me feel great every time she does it. When you are new at @CAPS3, it's good to make other people laugh, especially when it's not at you directly. To be honest, @CAPS5 made me feel like people were starting to like me as a person, not just seeing me as ""the new kid"" but as a real human being. They were seeing me for who I am, not for what I want to be or what people perceive me as. That's all I could really ask for. So, in my opinion, yes, laughter is excellent for relationships. It shows that you have a sense of humor and that there is a real person inside that body, not just bones. Another reason is that it shows your personality, your true self. Isn't that what people want, for others to see them for who they are, not what people say they are? At least, that's what I desire. That's why I will never forget that class period. @CAPS4 showed me that if I just laugh with other people, I'll know that they aren't laughing at me in a mocking way; they are saying that I am funny. That's what people want, to be seen for who they truly are. The teacher was a substitute for that day, and she kept getting angry at us for laughing, but we couldn't help it because it was so funny. That period, I laughed throughout. I was laughing so hard that I peed my pants a little. She made fish faces and made sounds as if she were pretending to be a monkey in a tree. She laughed the way I laugh; she did everything to make me laugh. @CAPS5 was so hilarious that it filled the whole period. That's how much I was laughing. I got up and was going to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, she was still there. I sat down, and then @CAPS7 and @PERSON1 came in. There was something in his pocket, and I poked at it and said, ""What is that? It's @CAPS8."" We all started laughing because it was funny; it was his wallet. I didn't understand why they were still laughing when I stopped, but then I continued to laugh because of the way they were laughing. We all were laughing, and then we all stopped at the same time. Because we all stopped at the same time, we all started laughing again because it was so funny. The sub came and stood there by us, and we all got quiet and then started laughing again. I think the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing silly things. I turned around to do my work, and then @CAPS4 spun me around so that I would start laughing again. Then I started laughing so hard that I started crying. @CAPS4 started laughing so hard that she couldn't stop. At the end of the period, I had to pee so badly. @CAPS4 wouldn't let me go; she just kept making me laugh more and more. Sometimes, just laughing for no reason is the most enjoyable thing. I guess my whole belief is that laughter is one of the best things a person can do. Not only is it fun, but it is also a very healthy thing to do. Laughter truly has the power to build and strengthen relationships."
539	21391	8	3	"I have been eagerly waiting a whole year for @TIME1 day to arrive, @DATE1. Today is my birthday! I can hardly wait to open presents and devour the delicious cake. I am turning @NUM1, and all my friends are coming over; everything is set to be perfect. It should be an amazing day! First, I have to wait for my mom to come home from work. So today, I am going to go swimming, then go on a hike, and finally, my friends can come over, and the party will start. We will have exciting games, wonderful presents, and a scrumptious cake. My mom said my sisters were automatically invited, but I don't like that rule. Maybe next birthday, @CAPS1 can uninvite them. My mom is at work. She left at @TIME1, and me and my sister just finished eating breakfast. Now we are going to go swimming. We have a pool right beside the patio in the front yard. Sometimes when my sister is angry, she just throws me into the pool. Other times, she does it just because she is bigger than me and can. My older sister @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was spending the week with us because she had moved away over the @DATE2 and decided to come visit. That's when they decided to start throwing me into the pool. One would always grab my legs, the other would grab my arms, and they would swing me until they just threw me in. Well, I got really mad after it kept happening, threw a tantrum, and cried. @PERSON1 told me that if I was going to act like a baby, then I deserved to be treated like one. So she put me in a diaper and in the high - chair and forced me to eat baby food. Of course, I was crying now because I don't like baby food, being in a high - chair, or being put in a diaper. By @TIME1, I didn't want to go on a hike and just wanted my mom to be home. Finally, my mom was home, and even better, she brought pizza. I was so thrilled that she did because all my friends were coming over, and pizza was the perfect treat. My mom changed out of her work clothes, and then she decided it was time for me to take a nap. Well, I am @NUM1; I don't need a nap, so I knew something was up. Now that I decided it was @CAPS3, I went and took a nap and actually did fall asleep. My mom, at @TIME1, cleaned the house, decorated it, and went to get all my friends. When I woke up and walked out of the living room, mom and all my friends screamed ""surprise,"" and I was definitely taken aback. After a long and fun - filled party, it was time to clean up. We put all the garbage away and the cake in the oven so no flies would come to it. The next day, my mom went back to work, and I swam and played all day! It was a great day. I got to wear my new swim - suit and also play with my new floaty toys I received. I got a lot of @DATE2 stuff. Then, me and my little sister @PERSON3 were trying to find a way to get hot water into the pool, but we were having trouble because the hose didn't fit the faucet in the bathroom. So that's when we went to my mom's room and used the bathtub and put the hose all the way out the back door. We definitely accomplished that mission! By @TIME1, we heard a lot of commotion, and I went to see what was going on. It was smoky everywhere. I went into the kitchen"
540	21392	8	3	"Gym clothes @CAPS1  People say laughter can bring together anyone. I do not know if that is true but, I do know that it can bring together two very unlikely @CAPS1 . Me and my best friend are complete opposite yet we became best @CAPS1 over a simple joke in the locker room. It happened on a @TIME1 that was not going to great for me, or her. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 I had to go to school. I had woken up late just the missed, walked all the way to school and had already dropped my lunch in the hallway about three times when, I walked straight into @PERSON1. (my soon to be best friend) ""@CAPS2 where your going."" she said to me in a catty voice and stuck me with a pointed glare. Me being shy, i just ducked my head and kept walking. @PERSON1 was one of the prettiest girls in school and hung out with the "" In "" clique I, well I didn't. Most of the time I hung out by my self.  Her @TIME1 had been going just about as well as mine was. Her @CAPS3 had broken up with her ,for her best friend, at the time,she also had stayed the night in the hospital with her brother who had been in a car accident. So she was in the same mood I was.What was even worse was our next class was @CAPS4.E.! I got into the locker room and as soon as I walked in I realized I had forgotten my gym clothes. @PERSON1 had just entered behind me and by the sigh she let out I knew she had forgotten hers to . We were going to have to use some from the bucket...  The bucket was where all lost or unwanted items ended up @CAPS5 there was cool stuff like sweat shirts and @CAPS5 neat tee shirts but you could never be sure if they were clean. Today though, it looked like there was only guy clothes. I walked over to the bucket and @PERSON1 came over next to me. We both began to dig through the bucket. Finding nothing but over sized sweat pants and extra large shirts we @CAPS6 out the ones we thought were the best. We changed and as soon as our eyes met we both started cracking up. We looked like two little kids playing in their dads clothes. She could not let go of her pants or else they would drop around her ankles and the shirt I was wearing hung down past my knees. Neither of us stopped laughing until our sides ached and there were tears running down our faces.  When the @ORGANIZATION1 teacher banged on the door we walked out of the locker room and the whole gym stared at us but we had found confidence and friendship in each other so, we didn't care. Sense that day @PERSON1 and I have been glued to each others sides as best @CAPS1. We have been through many fights but every time I think about that day in the locker room I can't help but to laugh. That is how laughter brought @PERSON1 and I to be best @CAPS1."
541	21393	8	3	I believe that laughter is a truly healthy and wonderful way to get along with someone and have a great deal of fun! I firmly think that the more you laugh, the more enjoyment you'll have when you're with someone or a group of people. One time, me and my dear friend @PERSON1 were hanging out at my cozy house, and we literally couldn't stop laughing. Every little thing seemed hilarious to us for some strange reason! It makes our time together so much more enjoyable when we can just share laughter instead of getting into silly fights. I absolutely love to laugh; all my friends often call me a bit obnoxious because I laugh all the time. I truly feel like if you're laughing heartily with someone, it brings you closer, and it's far healthier and better to just let the laughter flow! For example, I always eagerly want to hang out with @PERSON1 because we always laugh together and have a really good time. It's like when you're part of a group of friends, and some of them constantly disagree on something or get into fights; it's never any fun. If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you always share laughter with them, it just makes you want to be around them even more because you're having such a great time. Fighting, on the other hand, just does the opposite!   I've recently come to clearly realize who my good friends are and who are the not - so - good ones. Laughing is truly the most important quality to have in someone. The girls I often fight with are usually the ones who seem to have no real personality, are very negative, and are just generally mad people. My friends that I do get along with always laugh and have a great time together. The only time I've ever gotten in a fight with one of my good friends was because those negative people always say random, untrue, and hurtful things, which can drag that person down with you! I've truly realized that the more you laugh, the more fun you'll have, and the more people will want to be around you! I've also noticed that my mom and dad are completely different types of people. My mom is a real sweetheart who always has a laugh and I can always have a great deal of fun with her. My dad, on the other hand, hardly ever laughs. I honestly can't remember the last time I heard him laugh. He's such a downer, and no one ever really wants to be around him. That's probably one of the reasons why my parents are divorced! You can just tell that my mom has a lot more fun in life, while my dad doesn't. In life, you really just have to have fun, do what you're supposed to do, and laugh. So, really, what I'm trying to say is that laughing is an extremely important part of any relationship; whether it's with friends, family, or in a dating situation, it's definitely a wonderful quality to have.
542	21394	8	3	When I was in third grade, my parents made the decision that we should move to the place where my @CAPS1 was born and raised and where my @CAPS2 lived. I, being a very determined third - grader, was extremely angry. I firmly told them that I would not move and even stubbornly sat on the floor, insisting that I was not going. Needless to say, my little protest didn't get me very far, but I was still extremely unhappy about being moved away from my dear friends and my @CAPS3's side of the family that I had been close to since I was a little kid. My friends were all I had known throughout my years in elementary school, and I was nowhere near ready to say goodbye to them. It was incredibly hard saying goodbye to them, even though we did come back and visit later on. We moved three long hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty significant move, especially for a ten - year - old who had never really been anywhere else.   Being a new student is never an easy thing. Especially with a shy and quiet personality like mine, the first day was a truly scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked into the school with my @CAPS4, and my new teacher happened to be in the office at that moment. So, she kindly took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still so frightened and was really upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started, the teacher made me stand up in front of the whole class and tell them about myself. I've never been much of a public speaker, and it's hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can't even do that very well today, and I'm way less shy than I was back then. It was extremely terrifying, to say the least, even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in complete dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and, being the shy person I am, didn't say a word for the rest of the time until lunch.   At lunch, a little girl with cute freckles and glasses, just like me, came and sat with me. Once she managed to break down my shy exterior, we were laughing, playing, and having a really great time. And for the first time that day, I thought to myself that moving might actually turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends, along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers, and spent every recess together. She was the first best friend I made when I moved, and I'm really glad it was her and not someone else. Today, I'm very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I was initially shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you don't know. The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day, I'm not sure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend, it would have been a very lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you don't know someone very well, you can still have a great time. The rest of that day is a much better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in.
543	21397	8	3	"@CAPS1 to @CAPS2"" @CAPS3, you've probably seen those little signs that say, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS2""? People often put them in their homes as a gentle reminder on how one should live their life. Well, I wholeheartedly believe that laughter is one of the most crucial elements you need in order to live your life to the fullest. Laughter keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the spirit joyful. Without laughter, one might feel that they have an emptiness inside that they're unable to fill. Laughter has played an enormous role in my life and has created some of the most amazing memories. If laughter was not a part of me, my life would be like a house without furniture; empty, dull, and overall, rather pointless.   Some memories will forever be etched in my mind, and looking back, I still laugh my brains out. My favorite and most hilarious memory that I can think of occurred about two years ago at my grandparents' house. My family and I were staying with my grandparents for the weekend up at their lovely house in @CAPS7, which I absolutely adored because there was so much to do there! They had cool go - carts, fun golf carts, a large acreage, and a gigantic swimming pool! What more could someone possibly want? The weather was always nice and warm as well, so I had no complaints at all.   It was a beautiful evening, and my brother, his best friend, and I decided to take the golf carts out for a spin. My brother was in his own golf cart, zooming by at a fast pace, and I was in one with his friend @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 must have seen something in the road because he told me to stop, then he hopped out. As he curiously made his way to the front of the golf cart, I gently pressed on the gas, inching forward in a sort of quick manner just to give him a little scare. As I did that, he frantically jumped on the hood like a startled cat. I then decided to slam on the brakes, and when that happened, @PERSON1 launched off like a rocket, but then tried to hop back on the hood. I guess you could say we developed a little game. I would go a few inches or so, then slam on the brakes! At that point, I was practically crying from laughing so hard.   That is until something very unexpected happened...I drove fast and then stopped very abruptly, but as I did so, this time @PERSON1 tripped! I didn't notice because I was carelessly driving like a wild person, but soon enough the golf cart was on top of him! All I remember hearing was a @CAPS8 @CAPS9! and then a loud shrill. He was lying face - first, with the cart on his back, and I had no idea what to do! My heart quickly started racing, and a wave of fear came over me. I looked to my right to find my brother rolling around on his back, laughing like a crazy hyena! I was still sitting in the golf cart, still frozen in my state of shock. My brother finally got up, and @PERSON1 was yelling, ""@CAPS10't move @CAPS11!"" I knew I had to do something! My brother was trying to tell me that we should lift the heavy cart from his back, but in my head, I knew that both of us together wouldn't have been able to do that. Taking matters into my own hands, I carefully shifted into reverse and very slowly, biting down on my lower lip and closing my eyes tightly, I pounded the gas to the ground, flying backwards off of his helpless body. Luckily, no damage was done, and @ORGANIZATION1 was perfectly fine. A huge weight was lifted from my back, and I was able to breathe again. Looking back, I'm able to laugh and joke about that wonderful day that went so wonderfully wrong, though I'm very thankful that nothing extremely harmful happened to the poor guy I accidentally ran over that day. I can tell you one thing, as the day carried on, we had a blast. Carelessly being the carefree teenagers we are, and without a worry in the world; we laughed, swam, drove the golf carts, and enjoyed the wind swooping our hair up, then down, then all around. I take back two important things from this crazy day. One, make smart decisions, and be prepared for the consequences that you might be faced with, and two, enjoy your life. Laugh like there's no tomorrow. Be a bit careless yet still careful, and enjoy every single second of it! I've learned that when faced with a tough decision; for example...do I roll off of my brother's friend? or do I continue to sit here and listen to him yell? In that case, I took a big leap of faith and went with my gut instinct, which I believe was definitely the right decision. Go with your gut instinct in life, and laugh."
544	21398	8	3	"Laughter. How do you precisely define it? Is it the non - existence of happiness? Without laughter, there would be no warm smiles. Without smiles, there would be no genuine affection. Without affection, there would be no real emotion. Without emotion, there would be no proper reaction. Without a reaction, everyone around you would seem like blank slates.   Laughter can do so many diverse things. It can bring people closely together or, unfortunately, even tear them apart. It can be a powerful way to express yourself, or even a means to put up ""your walls."" Laughter can mean so many different things. It can show so many various emotions, or even cleverly hide them. For example: there are those people who laugh when they cry, when they're mad, when they're sad, etc. But look deeper beyond the surface. Why do you think they're laughing at these times? When really, that's not at all the emotion they're truly feeling. They're not laughing because they're an all - around happy person. They're laughing to hide the true pain they're feeling inside, because whether they like it or not, no human can completely lay ""it all on the line."" To be so vulnerable means that anyone could get in and cause pain.   So, how important is laughter to you? In any kind of relationship, laughter is of great significance. Whether it's a close friendship, a loving marriage, an exciting engagement, etc. To know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference in the world. So, one simple laugh or giggle could completely turn the situation around. Laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people, bridging gaps and creating connections that last."
545	21399	8	3	Imagine this, speeding past tall trees on a @CAPS1 @NUM1, powerful four - wheeler, desperately trying to keep up with everybody that's in front of you. That is exactly how it was on New Year's Eve. We eagerly headed out from the house at about @NUM2 o'clock pm. When we left the house, we quickly headed for one of our friends' house because we had asked them earlier if they wanted to go on this adventure with us. So, when we left, we had to leave in a hurry so that we wouldn't be on the road for a long time.   When we got to our friends' house, we casually hung out for a little while. Then we asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They quickly got all ready, and then at about @NUM2:45, we all excitedly headed
546	21403	8	3	"Laughter @CAPS1 us @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was the @DATE1 of middle school and the entire music department was going on our exciting @DATE1 field trip. Everyone was going to the well - known @LOCATION2 for the biggest concert any one has ever been to. Only the students in eighth grade in either band, choir, jazz band, or jazz choir were able to go; if @CAPS16 didn't pay all your funds, then @CAPS16 were left behind. We were going to a comfortable hotel, attending a magnificent concert, and going to a thrilling @CAPS4 @CAPS5.  My friends, the enthusiastic @PERSON3, the lively @PERSON2, and the energetic @PERSON4 were without a doubt excited. We have never been on the longest road trip till then. @CAPS3 seemed to have taken days to get to @LOCATION2. We left at five in the morning with over one hundred kids packed tightly into two buses. One bus was for the boys and one for the girls, yet there were more girls then boys so we split the boys bus.  I was stuck sitting with @CAPS6. @CAPS6 is a nice girl, but @CAPS3 was difficult to start conversations with her. @CAPS17 wanted to be back home in the cozy @LOCATION1. I never found out why @CAPS17 was so upset; which made my ride there unbelievably boring. Until @PERSON3's accident. @CAPS17 snorted a pretzel up her nose. Overall @CAPS17 was okay and everyone besides @CAPS6 laughed along with her.  By the third hour of sitting in a cramped bus, us girls had to go to the bathroom. Complaining to the bus driver @CAPS17 replied, ""We're almost to the pit stop. Just another hour or so."" The choir girls began singing about going to the bathroom. Soon the bus was filled with our melodious song and laughter. Finally @CAPS8, the experienced bus driver, pulled over. A line of dancing girls bulged out of the bathroom laughing at each other.  Once we were done we said our farewells to the boys as they piled onto the bus and took off. ""@CAPS9 down. Lets get to @LOCATION2."" @CAPS8 said. We cheered as we drove off. Four hours later, we were stopped yet again, at another gas station eating our lunch. The boys were fine with how much progress we made; starting calling everyone of us girls the boys were getting annoying. Us girls ignored all calls from boys for the rest of our trip. Finally we got to our hotel.  At the hotel the boys got the top story while the girls got the lower story near the swimming pool. When dinner came along @PERSON1, our kind - hearted music director, aloud everyone to roam around the stores near by and buy our dinners. Luckily we were near @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and a numerous amount of fast food places. @PERSON4 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 while @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 got our drinks; since we didn't want @ORGANIZATION1 drinks they went to @ORGANIZATION3 to buy @CAPS11. We met back at our room with our goods. We gorged ourselves till our abdomens seemed to explode. Dancing her way into the bathroom, @PERSON3 apeard with a broom as her dancing partner. Our laughter filled the room. We partied on till we realized we had a concert to attend.  We had two hours till the concert and thirty dollars was missing. @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I searched our room almost missing breakfast and ending up empty handed. When we found the girls across the hall all except one of them were there. The remaining girls looked at each other. "" @CAPS6 was out of money yesterday and now all of the sudden @CAPS17 has money to buy food. We're missing fifty dollars."" @CAPS13 replied. @PERSON1 then came in, ""@CAPS14 up. We got a concert to attend."" @CAPS15 at each other with disapointment we all left.  Running to the back stage door I dropped my music. @PERSON2 laughed picking @CAPS3 up. ""@CAPS16'll do great."" @CAPS17 said smiling. I smiled back, ""@CAPS18 @CAPS16."" I turned and stepped out onto the empty stage and took my seat in the front of the band. Picking up my flute I began my solo. The soft chords filled my ears as I imagined myself alone. Although I was nervous my stage fright gracefully vanished.  I ran out the auditorium doors. Girls and boys laughing with me as we raced to the buses. The bus drivers hurried their way to the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Once we were there, @PERSON1 payed for everyone and we were off. Laughing at ourselves @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I screamed at the top of our lungs when the @CAPS19 shock dropped. When the ride was over, we all laughed seeming to have come @CAPS2.  I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. Everyone piled back on the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home. Laughing at every mistake we made, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I took a group picture to remember the trip. Some how amongst the trip we laughed together at everything. Nothing stood in our way when we laughed. In the end, laughter truly @CAPS1 us and made this trip an unforgettable memory."
547	21404	8	3	"Laughter is one of the best things people can learn to do. Laughter is one of the many things I whole - heartedly enjoy doing. I love how everyone has their own distinctive laugh, some are loud and boisterous, while some are quiet almost like a gentle giggle. Not only do I enjoy it but I love that it helps me relieve stress, which is a major part of relationships. My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. Today we have been going out for a year and three months. We met when I was mowing my yard, and my neighbor @LOCATION1 brought him over to introduce us to each other. I mean she couldn't have brought him over at a worse time; I was hot and sweaty because it was a scorching eighty degrees out side, I had no make - up on, and I smelled like fresh cut grass. What a great first impression, huh? ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 this is @PERSON1"" she said with a warm smile. ""@CAPS3 timing @CAPS4"" I replied with a tone of obvious anger in my voice. ""sorry"" she said, ""but he said he wanted to meet you, and he wouldn't shut up about it."" I looked over at him and noticed that he blushed a little and I laughed. From then on I knew that @PERSON1 and I were going to have something great together. Till this day our relationship is stronger than ever, and it's because we can make each other laugh. Now don't get me wrong, trust, honesty, communication, listening, are all still a big part and those are important too, but I think that having humor and being able to laugh in a relationship is one of the key things to a healthy and long lasting relationship. My boyfriend and I have a great sense of humor, and we definitely like to use it in our relationship. I could have the worst day of my life; and when I talk to him on the phone I know my day is going to change from horrible to fantastic. Just because I know that within the first few minutes of talking to him and hearing his voice, he's going to say something funny and I can't help but to laugh. I honestly believe you need a good sense of humor in your relationship if you want it to last. When you don't have laughter in your relationship, it tends to get very dull and boring. You can't be serious twenty - four seven, that's way too stressful. Since laughter helps relieve stress, you will definitely need it during your relationship so it doesn't get stressful and turn into nothing but a bunch of fighting and arguing. So in conclusion, I know your thoughts about what I just talked about might not be the same, but I hope after reading this you will be more willing to consider my opinions on the subject of laughter in a relationship, based on being able to enjoy and know what laughter is, and also how great of a thing it is. Laughter truly has the power to turn a relationship from ordinary to extraordinary."
548	21405	8	3	"I don't think people today laugh enough. Laughing is said to be one of the healthiest things out there. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should live forever! I firmly believe laughing really is healthy for you.  I have a friend who's really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to make the pain go away. If I could cheer her up @NUM1 times a day I'd be happy to do so. Yesterday her and I were together and I can't remember what we were talking about but it must of been good because she got me to laugh so hard that I threw up! I know that doesn't sound very fun, but even as I was coming up from doing that we were both still laughing. Times like that I can definitely look back and smile on. I love the wonderful effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking. Out of no where my mom pops up saying, ""@CAPS1!"" (this always happens though.) @CAPS2 did we scream our lungs out. I guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other only to start laughing hysterically at how silly that was.  Laughter really does bring people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you're laughing with someone you're usually laughing for the same reason, right? Just as my friend and I were in the car. That's what I love, because that means we have things in common. Laughter is a powerful bond that enriches our social experiences and makes life more enjoyable."
549	21407	8	3	The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think of laughter I think of my innocent @CAPS2, of all the things that got me rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs, enjoying the wonderful life that @CAPS4 gave me. We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. @CAPS3 when I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a cute puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day @CAPS3 I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @CAPS10 a few days later; his name was @CAPS5. The reason we named @CAPS10 @CAPS5 was because @CAPS9 would literally tip over while just walking.  One day @CAPS3 I got home from school I took @CAPS5 to the top of the high hill in our back yard, I was playing with @CAPS10 and running around and laughing. Every time @CAPS5 would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and @CAPS9 would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until @CAPS9 could get back up again, which normally wasn't until @CAPS9 was at the bottom of the hill. @CAPS3 @CAPS9 did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives to the fullest. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and @CAPS1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your @CAPS2 should carry on through the rest of your life, bringing joy and light. @CAPS4 has blessed us with so much, @CAPS9 has given us more than we give @CAPS10 credit for. Laugh for the moment, take @CAPS1 in the small things in life, embrace the amazing creation set before you, and love others like @CAPS4 loves you, because you never know @CAPS3 your time on this earth is over. Let the child - like laughter be a constant reminder of the beauty of life.
550	21408	8	3	In life every individual has their good days or their bad days. The last thing a person wants to do is be happy or laugh when that tough day has arrived. Sometimes a person has to look outside the box, take a broader view to look at the whole picture to feel happy about the people that individual is around. Laughter also helps make the time that you spend more enjoyable for yourself.  You might sometimes have to figure out if he/she is going to be a person full of laughter or excitement. You've got to put in consideration the people that influence you, as some might even be the ones who drag their feet day on.  The more insight
551	21409	8	3	"Growing up with both of my parents and having my dad's parents (my grandparents) has been the absolute best thing for me. I spent a ton of quality time at my grandparents' cozy house when I was a kid. Every Friday we got out of school an hour early. And every Friday of elementary school, my kind - hearted grandpa would be patiently waiting for me to get out of school. He would pick me up in his old - fashioned car and then we would go to either McDonald's or Burger King for lunch. I always eagerly wanted to go to McDonald's because they had a fun play structure. But growing up, I became really close with my grandma and grandpa. My parents didn't need to worry about babysitters because we always had my loving grandparents that would take care of me. So the bond with them just got stronger and stronger. I would always do my homework with my gentle grandma, and then when I was done I would go out with my grandpa and do yard work or tinker on something in the garage. A lot of what I know now was taught to me by my wise grandparents. I was a very lucky little kid to grow up having them in my life. Doing yard work with my Pop - Pop (which is what I called my grandpa when I was a kid) was actually fun. I loved yard work. He taught me how to use the riding lawn mower at a very young age. So by the time I was 10 years old I could start it up, mow the lawn, empty the grass from the catcher, and put the mower back in the garage when I was done without any help. Well one sunny summer day, when I finished mowing the lawn my grandpa was sitting on the patio drinking lemonade, like always. So I grabbed myself one and went and joined him because that is where he always sat and watched me mow the lawn and that's where we always hung out together. We're sitting there just talking, and he asks me if I hooked the hose back up to the faucet. Well of course I didn't because I wanted to go sit on the patio with my Pop - Pop. So him and I walked over to the faucet to hook it back up. But for whatever reason he told me to take the nozzle end out to some flowers. Now here is a 10 - year - old kid standing behind his Pop - Pop with the nozzle end of a hose with Pop - Pop bending over in front of me. So I did what any other mischievous little kid would do. I held the nozzle up, aimed right at that big booty of his, and pulled the trigger. After about a good 10 - second soaking of his bum, I dropped the nozzle and ran as fast as I could to my grandma. And when I got to her she was wondering why I was so scared. Well all I would say was, ""Pop - Pop is gonna kill me!"". Here comes Pop - Pop walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and I were standing. He had just the most straight angry look on this face. I literally thought that my butt was going to hurt forever after he spanked me. And so there the three of us were standing there. Me thinking that I'm going to die. And all of the sudden my grandpa gets the biggest smile on his face and both him and my grandma start cracking up. He wasn't mad, he thought it was hilarious! So of course I start laughing too! Pop - Pop came inside and changed his now water - soaked pants and underwear and then all three of us went out on the patio and just chilled and talked and drank some great lemonade. After a couple hours of relaxing with the best grandparents in the world, my grandma went inside to make dinner. So Pop - Pop and I stayed out on the patio and shot pine cones out of the tree with a BB gun, seeing who could shoot more down before dinner was ready. Grandma called us in for dinner. And that night was one of the best dinners that I ever had with my grandparents, because all we did was eat, and laugh, and eat, and laugh, and eat a little more, and laugh a little more! Well Pop - Pop and I had a tradition that was started when I was old enough to talk, drink root beer floats and watch westerns together. And from that night on to the day he died, my best friend was my Pop - Pop. He passed away about a year ago. Life hasn't been the same since then. But when he passed he left me his truck. Every morning when I get in and start it up, the sound of the engine just brings back memories of him and I. The sound of the blinker even brings some memories too. Ah, how I miss the good times."
552	21410	8	3	"When people think of football they think of the quarterback. When people think of basketball they think of the point guard. When people think of soccer they think of the goalie. Well when people think of softball they think of the pitcher. All these sports have one position where they are automatically put in a leader position. In softball, the game always starts with the pitcher and usually ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is involved in every single play. Sometimes the pitcher pitches it and the big 12 - inch softball comes darting back at you before you even blink your eye and then the ball that you just threw underhand you now have to throw overhand to any of the four bases in a matter of seconds. To play a major position on a team and be a successful leader you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly when the game is not going the way you want it to go, be able to stay calm and laugh and joke about the situation. I have been pitching fast - pitch softball for ten years, and the compliment I get the most often is ""you have the best pitcher's mentality I have ever seen"". It is so stressful to be in a really competitive game and have the whole game on your shoulders. Three people on base, one bad pitch right down the middle and it is over the fence. One pitch can completely change the game! At times like these when the pitch just didn't go the way it was supposed to go and your whole team just looks at you with this gloomy expression on their face. As the leader on the team you can't just act defeated as you feel. I have observed numerous pitchers who just completely give up and look defeated. By being a leader, the other athletes look to you to see your reaction. If you look like you have no hope, then players assume that the game is over and the very next play they will mess up and so on and it will just get worse. By smiling and encouraging your teammates, they see that the leader hasn't given up and neither should they, this is always better in the long run. Players tend to look at the pitcher as the most authority on the field and respond the exact same way as they do. I play for a team that most of the players this is their second to third year. We are not a very good team but we practice hard and we never give up, it doesn't matter what the score is. In our league out of the seven other teams four are in the top ten in the entire state. One team in particular is XYZ, they were first in state last year and we played them in our very first game last year. By the third inning we were losing 10 - 0. Even though I knew there was no possible way we were going to catch up, my goal was not to let them score again. In between innings I talked to every single player on my team, I tried cheesy jokes, inside jokes, anything to get rid of the tension. It worked and we played much better by having fun and being relaxed. Being in stressful situations people just have to find a way to laugh it off and see the bright side of any predicament and be able to get through it. In the end, a positive attitude can turn the tide of a game and make the sport more enjoyable for everyone."
553	21411	8	3	We all need laughter once in our life! But why do we need it? Or why is it important to us? We need laughter to have a great time with our friends and family because without laughter our lives would be black and white. We would be empty from inside with no spark of happiness and we would be grumpy all the time. Laughter is also important to us because it helps us build relationships with people we really like, be it a female or a male. It's important that in a relationship, you also have a great time when you are with that special person and not be bored and talk about things that really don't matter. Laughter is the key to a successful relationship or friendship. Once I used to live in a small town called Greenville till my parents decided to move to a big city, Los Angeles. When my parents told me I was going to go to a new high school, I knew a few people from this high school. The people I knew were Tom, and Sarah but I didn't really talk with Mike or Jake before. I only talked with Sarah. On my first day of high school, Sarah presented her friends to me because I didn't really know anybody else besides them three. She would make up any kind of jokes and would involve me in it so I would be able to meet these friends better and maybe be friends with them. Laughter always helps in making friends and boyfriends. I started dating when I was in middle school. I dated three guys. My third boyfriend was the best. He was sweet and nice. He would do anything just to make me laugh. We only dated for two years but unfortunately, there was too much drama that I broke up with him. It was really hard because I really liked him but we would still talk and make fun of each other. He would still be nice to me even if we were not together. After a year without dating, he decided to ask me if I wanted to be his girlfriend again. I thought about it a lot because I didn't want to go through the same drama as before. While we were not dating, he would always find a way to make me laugh or smile. When he sees me down, he is always there for me to support me and make me laugh. That's what I like about him. He's sweet and nice but if he only didn't believe what his friends tell him, we would still be together and we would be laughing at everything together. We would make fun of each other. We would never stop laughing. It was some great times when I was with him. But he still tries to keep a smile on my face even if I'm mad, sad or not in the mood of doing something. That's why we need laughter in our lives because it brings joy to those people that love us and care for us. And by us having a smile on our face, they are happy. Always make a relationship good by having a good time and making each other laugh one way or another. It doesn't matter how you laugh, the thing is that you have fun. In conclusion, laughter enriches our relationships and makes life more fulfilling.
554	21412	8	3	"Have you ever thought something was really funny where you felt like you were going to pee your pants? Or have you felt like the side of your stomach was going to explode because you were laughing so hard? Well, this happened to me. It was all so crazy like a dream. It was during my 8th - grade graduation day to be exact. My brother Tom and my friend Lisa and I were walking through the park minding our own business, just trying to have a good time. My brother was talking to Lisa about this really funny joke that he heard at school. I don't remember the joke but I do remember how funny it was because I nearly peed my pants. It was so embarrassing but at the same time funny. I don't know why though. So I told them if they don't stop telling each other jokes I might pee my pants. But of course, what any brother would do is just keep on going. They thought it was just so funny, well not me. I thought it was mean and painful if you know what I mean because I had a full bladder. My friend Lisa, the sweet, loving person she is, suggested to go find a bathroom. So off we went on the mission to find a bathroom. Tom, my brother, said ""Well, I believe that there is a bathroom up this hill. Let's check it out and see if it is open so that you can go to the bathroom"". Little did we know that it was a Tuesday and the bathrooms were closed for the workers to come in and clean. When we made it all the way up the hill, I literally ran to the bathroom. I never felt this way before. It was just so painful. I could not put it into words. Soon enough, I found out the doors were locked. I was so mad and devastated. Tom and Lisa thought it was funny because I had to pee really bad and the bathroom was closed. They were laughing so hard, but I got tired of hearing them. So I ditched them to go find the closest bathroom. Sadly, it was a mile away. That made me so mad. I wanted to cry. But of course, that would get me no where! This is what I said in my head ""That means I need to run"". I ran back up the hill, across the bridge and towards the nearest store as possible. FINALLY!!! I found a store. It was a sign of relief. I was so happy. I could barely breathe at this point. I walked into the store up to the store clerk and asked them if I could use your restroom. They pointed me to the direction. I walked in there head held high and felt like I accomplished something even though I did not except the fact that I did not pee my self. Thank god!! Tom and Lisa finally caught up with me. They walked into the store looking for me. I walked out of the bathroom to find them standing by the door waiting for me. Then all of a sudden, I see a change in their face. They are laughing. I ask them what's so funny and they point at my pants. I looked down and I see water all over my pants. I must have got water on me when I was washing my hands. Well"
555	21413	8	3	Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful.
556	21414	8	3	"Can you imagine life without laughter? Life would be so serious, filled with a constant heaviness, and relationships would be so boring, lacking the light - hearted moments that make them special. That favorite comedy? Not funny at all. America's funniest home videos, how can you not laugh! Laughter is a way to express emotions in a positive manner. What is it that relationships are built off of? Honesty, trust, understanding, and humor. Do you really want to be around someone who is boring? Because I don't. I believe strong friendships and relationships need laughter in them to keep them interesting. Many of my relationships have begun from a joke, a bout of laughter, or me being clumsy. I remember being in a class where I knew no one, and this is a very awkward situation to be in. I sat in the back of the class, with one other person, her name was Sarah. It started off quiet and no one saying anything, so I decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. As soon as I told it, there was a silence afterward, where we just stared at each other. Seconds later we busted out in laughter, you know the kind of uncontrollable laugh, where you cannot breathe, and your tear ducts are overwhelmed to the point where tears slide down your cheeks? When this happened there is a sudden bond, a spark of friendship between the two of us. From that point we were inseparable. For the rest of the school year, we were partners on every project, multitasking our way through them. Half the time we would be making up funny scenarios, and laughing until we cried. The other half we would have make a fantastic project using the inspiration of each other to get the work done. I am an all - around ""laughter enthusiast!"" I can make the smallest things funny, it's a quality I enjoy very much. Who knew a silly joke could go so far? Laughter cannot be the only element to a developed relationship, you need trust, honesty and various qualities to keep a healthy relationship. My point is, how can you maintain a friendship with someone whom you can't laugh with, or be yourself with? It is human nature to laugh, you can't always be serious. I don't think that I could go a day without laughing. Laughing can be the antidote for a frown. Moral of the story, laugh!"
557	21415	8	3	For my family laughter is important to us because it just means that my parents aren't fighting that day. I was about nine years old and it was the week of Christmas. My parents had been fighting all day, for me it seemed like it would never end. Usually Christmas was what I looked forward to all year, but now I just wanted it to be over. I hated seeing my parents fight, because it always scared my little brother. My little sister was too young to know what was going on, but whenever they started fighting around her, she started to scream and yell. When my parents fought I tried to keep my brother and sister busy but that never kept me busy. I still heard everything they said and it seemed to never stop. My sister was about one year old and when my parents fought she came into my room a lot because it was the farthest room from where the yelling was going on. We would watch cartoons and play games until it stopped. Once, it went on for so long that she fell asleep in my room and I ended up taking her to her bed that night. There were so many times where I wished my parents would just stop fighting and realize that it not only makes them upset, it made all of us upset. Well, the day before Christmas eve my mom was at work and my dad had to go to work too. Since my mom's work doesn't allow kids to be there, my dad took us along. I could tell he had been up late because he had dark circles under his eyes and he had forgotten to shave that morning. Since, we were all on break from school, my whole day was spent making sure my little sister didn't get into mischief or get hurt. I had fun at my dad's work because I loved playing with my little sister. My sister still wobbled when she walked so it made me laugh when we would play tag because she could never run fast enough and it made me laugh just to see her try. She loved it too because walking now gave her so much more freedom but she got herself into a lot more mischief now. On days when my dad didn't have much to do, he would have me help him try and teach my brother how to ride a two - wheeler. It was a lot of fun seeing my brother try new things and have fun with it. It made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy that he could do something that he couldn't do before. When Christmas eve came my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days because they wanted us to be happy on Christmas morning. Except that night they had a really big fight after they thought all of us had gone to bed. I had stayed up that night really late cause I was watching a bunch of my favorite Christmas movies. I had just turned the TV off when I heard them yelling. I didn't get much sleep that night because of all the yelling and screaming. Luckily, my brother and sister were already asleep and I didn't have to worry about them. The next morning, I didn't know what to expect from my parents. Everything was how it normally was on Christmas morning. There were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings. My brother came in and woke me up and said that everyone was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed. I got out of bed, put my robe and my slippers on and went out to the living room. What I saw when I got out there was not at all what I had expected. My brother was sorting the presents so that everyone had their own pile. My dad was laughing at my sister, who was trying to pick up a present that was as tall as her. And my mom was in the kitchen making everyone's favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and sausage. Everyone seemed so much happier then they had been the last few days. As we all ate our breakfast and opened presents, I realized this was the first morning in a while that my parents haven't fought. It made me really happy to see them getting along. We all laughed and had a great time that Christmas morning. The rest of the day was great too. Laughter is still a big part in my family, even though my parents are separated now. It's a lot better now because we have a lot more moments of laughter and being happy then being upset and having to listen to them fight all the time. Now that we are happy and laugh a lot more, being at home is a lot better. I really do believe laughter plays a big part in any family.
558	21416	8	3	Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship. There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension, or even just relieve some stress every once in a while. It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and also the cheapest. Laughter is easily found and common to come by. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and I and for no particular reason at all; it not only saved, but it built our relationship to what it is today. When we were younger, my older sister and I did not get along very well at all. She would always tease me, then laugh about it; and I too would laugh at things that she did not find humorous in any way, shape, or form. This constantly caused conflict and many arguments between the two of us; therefore we hated each other and, in a sense, wanted nothing to do with each other. As my sister and I grew older and wiser, we started to become much more alike. We still made fun of, teased, antagonized, and pulled childish pranks on each other; but instead of getting angry, we would just laugh about it instead. As we continued to make each other laugh, we found ourselves getting along so much better. Soon after that, we began hanging out more and more and just for the fun of it, not because our parents told us to. Before we knew it, my sister and I were best friends. It is rare to hear about siblings being best friends. I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I feel that laughter has played a huge role in the relationship between my older sister and I. Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what, we can always make one another laugh and virtually cheer each other up. We hang out when we need to get away or when we have something that we need to get off our chests. We know we have each other for that because we know we can always laugh about it in the end. Laughter truly is the glue that holds our special bond together.
559	21418	8	3	"Laughter is an interesting emotion. It's one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous. This, however, isn't always the case. Some people laugh when they're embarrassed or uncomfortable. Others, when they're enraged and upset. And then, there are people who laugh when they are grieving or sad. People don't expect that to happen. To laugh when you are depressed. It is strange but true. I know this from personal experience, which led up to one of the most tragic events of my short life. I was about nine. The age when you're hyper and energetic almost nonstop. I had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door. My mom was waiting for me inside. ""Get in the car,"" she said. ""We're going to see your grandparents for a few hours."" I was upset. I was not only tired and hungry, but I had to drive almost an hour away to see my grandparents. So I did what any nine - year - old would do. I cried, whined and pleaded her not to go. She didn't listen of course. She tuned me out, waited until I was out of air, and then picked me up and tossed me in the car. Isn't taking a nap great? That's exactly what I did on the ride over. I was exhausted, so I felt it was alright to have a little ""me"" time. When we got to their house, I had just woken up and didn't feel like moving. I had to force myself to get up and say hello. It was depressing, yet fascinating really. Seeing your grandparents is like seeing a glimpse of the future. In the sense that you know what you're going to look like when you're old. They had candy though, which was tasty and mouth - watering. We actually stayed for quite a few hours. My mom called my dad a couple of times asking if we could go home, but we never did. She just had a conversation with my grandparents while I watched television. At last, my dad finally called to say we could go home. We said goodbye and booked it before it was too dark out. By the time we got home, it was pitch - black outside. We still hadn't eaten yet and I was starving. I jumped out of the car and walked over to the gate that separated the front yard from the back. I shook the gate, expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start jumping on the gate wanting to play. Instead, only two showed. ""Where's Max?"" I wondered. I thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so I decided to just go inside and eat. When I opened the door to the house, both of my parents were standing in the entry way. I could tell they were trying to hold back tears. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks. ""Max passed away,"" my mom said. I froze. I didn't believe them. I couldn't. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, possibly more. I didn't know what to do. Then something weird happened. I started to laugh. I don't know why I did. Maybe it's because I wanted to try to cheer myself up. Or maybe, I realized he was in a better place. To this day I still feel an empty space in my heart where my best friend once was. I still think about why I laughed that day. I think about why we laugh in general. Whether it's when you're happy, angry, or even sad, we laugh to try to get by and make the best of both good and bad situations. As tragic as the situation was, I can't help but feel happy. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk, so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and quite frankly, I don't think I would have felt better if I hadn't laughed that night. It was awkward at first. It felt wrong and terrible, but it helped me more than I could have ever anticipated. In the end, laughter became a strange form of comfort in a time of great sorrow."
560	21419	8	3	The Power of Laughter The power of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. Emily is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended up tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The Incident and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it. The Incident began last summer during my high - school soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The Incident has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should
561	21421	8	3	"Green is not my favorite color, especially after what happened during that fateful @DATE1. Laughter is an indulging part of life that a variety of people @MONTH1 enjoy or @MONTH1 not enjoy. Humor happens to be infectious. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared upon one another, it binds people together and increases happiness and intimacy. Having to pick out one of the million laughter memories I have had was nearly impossible for me to decide, because every moment I spend opening my mouth and bursting out my ""ha - ha - ha"" with joy and excitement. I try to indulge the person I spent it with and the exact memory that happened.  It was the @DATE1, @CAPS1 for many of us @DATE1 is one of the most enthusiastic times of our twelve months in the year. I was going to be hosting a pool party with all of my friends, @CAPS12 I needed to clean it out because it happened to be awfully disgusting from all the year - long seasons that the weather decided to bring down. I didn't think it would be that much of a deal because that was the only way I would be able to host my party with my parents' permission. @CAPS1 if you know me well enough, I am the average typical teenage girl that probably texts more than @NUM1 texts a day. So since I can't keep my white, somewhat sweaty hands off my phone you @MONTH1 already have a feeling of what happens next. If you thought I dropped it, you're absolutely wrong. Not surprisingly after cleaning out my pool for about one hour I finally finished, @CAPS2 I texted my boyfriend telling him that my pool was no longer green anymore. He replied with "".......?"" I questioned myself if I had sent the wrong message to the wrong person so I checked my history and it turns out that I had wrote to him, "" @CAPS3 my poop is no longer green anymore."" I was literally mortified. I didn't know what emotion to feel or what to expect from him later that day. I decided to just pretend it didn't happen anymore. So later that day my pool party started. Everyone showed up and looked at me in a weird way then usual @CAPS12 I was to ecstatic and pumped to my favorite song by my favorite singer @NUM2. As everyone showed up they all had a present bag in their hand, I wondered to myself why they brought presents if it wasn't anybody's birthday it was just a casual pool party to welcome everyone's favorite season, @DATE1. So I asked the question to my best friend and she told me, ""@CAPS4 we know its nobody's birthday @CAPS12 @CAPS5 texted all of us telling us you had green poop, and you were not feeling well so we went to @CAPS6 to buy you @CAPS7 - @CAPS8, and @CAPS9 @CAPS10 ."" I was petrified and to be honest actually laughing insanely hard. So I stood up in front of all my guests and told them what had really happened and we all laughed historically. Without exception we kept the party going, and I eventually saw my boyfriend coming. I walked up to him and all we did was laugh with compassion and didn't mention one word about what had happened.   Once the party was over and it became dawn we decided to have a bonfire and get cozy with our loved one, and just all us friends bond with one another. You can guess what happened next, we began to talk about what had happened earlier and I can honestly say I don't think I have laughed that hard in my fifteen years alive. Rapidly our curfew had almost expired for the day, so all my friends left and they made a nickname for me, ""@CAPS11."" @CAPS12 the funniest part about this story that I will never forget is, that when all my friends left, my boyfriend decided to take me out and get a burger at our local, also known as the best hamburgers in our town. As we finished eating a mother came along with her baby boy. I had to take a few seconds out of my life to carry it, and make my dummy - looking face in order to make it jiggle a bit. @CAPS12 little did I know that the baby had just eaten. So you can imagine what happens next, green vomit gets all over me. I was honestly not mad, nor embarrassed. I just laughed so hard that I could feel my abs working out and tears from my eyes coming out. I believe in each and everyone of our lives we all have a special moment we desire to worship forever. It @MONTH1 be sad, embarrassing or even a comical quality type of moment we indulge in our memory. So till this day I am still known as ""@CAPS11"" to my friends, and there is no doubt that I will ever forget this memory."
562	21422	8	3	"Laughter in someone's life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, board games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were impatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breathe. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents' blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breathe, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our bellies full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy, just like those precious moments with my brother and dad."
563	21424	8	3	"Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you don't know very well or someone you have known for a long time and don't talk to anymore, you can make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make others laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldn't hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear - shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Every time we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS1 day we laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS1 had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshmen. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definitely downgraded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair - cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both started laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble for it, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice - principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS1 student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS1 person and I told the vice - principal that he is very obnoxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice - principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble - maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through."

When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were.

Little did I know it was going to be a hard task. My brother said I didn't need training wheels. Although I was scared
565	21426	8	3	When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4 my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was @CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was @CAPS6. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was @CAPS3. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @CAPS1 who said her name was @PERSON1, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting @PERSON2, my older sister the following @DATE1 because she was attending college in @LOCATION1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally @CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS3 in her room for a few weeks until @CAPS2 could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, @CAPS1 ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for @CAPS2 to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @CAPS1 was a really great cook. @CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to @CAPS3. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my @ORGANIZATION1 was having a @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @PERSON3 and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, @ORGANIZATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 friends show up and decide to leave @CAPS3. I see the hurt in @CAPS3's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day @CAPS3 and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister @CAPS3.
566	21427	8	3	"Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When you're angry, sad, nervous, or even mourning, laughter can be a powerful remedy. Laughing about the good times you had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious, can turn things around. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in some way or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought, which made me look on the positive and light - hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school, most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better, it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, sometimes hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There were three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what; it was so many years ago. But then one boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular. Yes, we were all eight or nine years old, but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says, ""You're not in shape, you're fat"". This crushed me. How was I supposed to reply to this? I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear those evil words repeating in my head, stinging me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper. I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out of this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter than to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus, I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. I started to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed, ""Honey, what's the matter, what happened?"" Through my tears, I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boy's name. I told her it was [Boy's Name]. She began to laugh and say, ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth? Oh, honey, don't let that bother you. He isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh, realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, and the statements weren't even true, and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what [Boy's Name] said to me. Of course, even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless comment about any of his flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation. In the end, laughter proved to be a great healer in this small but painful moment of my childhood."
567	21428	8	3	In order to laugh, you have to be happy. I was once truly happy until I made some grave mistakes. The mistakes I've made have made me more disappointed in myself than anything else I could think of. I sit in a room that I don't want to be in because of my actions. My life was perfect before; I had my brothers, my parents, and the love of my life. Now I look back and realize that nothing is worth taking me away from them. The laughs I'm missing out on right now are what hurt the most, because I could be at home or even at school right now. Instead, I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. I'm trying to put a smile on my face even though I know I'm supposed to be happy deep down. My life was one of the best lives you could have asked for, but because of my actions, I ruined it. Every moment I got to have with my beautiful baby - girl, in other words, my love, was precious. I cherished the time I had with her, and now I have to wait to have a laugh with her. I get about forty - five minutes to an hour and a half every day to talk to her and my family, and it definitely hurts more than what you could imagine. Having to talk on the phone where you can barely hear them through it just kills me. Knowing that everything I've done has affected me and my family is a heavy burden. A lot affects my brothers, though, and I know they don't understand, but hopefully one day they will. Hearing my little brother [Brother's Name] over the phone crying because he can't see me just tears me up inside. Even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears. I almost feel like I could cry in front of these other kids that are in here too. My family is my main priority, and when I get out, I'm gonna make sure to get back on track for my family. So I can have the laughs that I want now. When I finally do get out, I'll make up for all the lost time and bring back the joy and laughter that once filled our lives.
568	21429	8	3	"The truly - inspirational, remarkable story of laughter I want to share is about myself. What is laughter, exactly? Some might say, ""Well, that's obvious. Laughter's a sound, emitted from a person when they think something is funny!"" That's as good a response as any other, and certainly quite believable. But I believe laughter has a much deeper definition; a definition that can only be explained through a marginally - humorous, less - than - inspirational story about my experiences as a high - school - novice - basketball player. This year, as a high school sophomore, I decided to do something I'd never done before: go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district, and to be able to exercise throughout the rain - drenched winter months in which basketball season took place. Having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the ""sit - outs"" zone in middle school gym class, my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun; and at least they get a calculator. Naturally, the year I decided to give basketball a shot, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon. Through sheer force of determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed ""better than dirt"" by the coaches; narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team. In the months ahead, I would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls... As astonishing as basketball was, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court. I soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively running up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, cheeks firmly planted on the bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action. Our team could play basketball, but not often on the same level as the teams we faced. As each game came and went, I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers' eyes; their morale was simply dropping, and no amount of my ball - playing abilities could change that. There was one game in particular when I discovered I didn't have to play in order to help my team. It was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down by about [Number] points against a team we had fared poorly against previously. Needless to say, players were becoming very frustrated. One of our star players, [Player's Name], was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather. He was raging, spitting profanities. He dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. His mom came down from the stands to give him water, which only embarrassed him more. Sitting beside [Player's Name], I could feel the anger radiating off of him. He was ranting under his breath over [Opponent's Name], the opposing team's point guard. I noticed that while [Opponent's Name]'s fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball - player, his voice, a good octave above his teammates', was much more suited for covering [Band Name] songs than calling out plays. I turned towards [Player's Name], tapping him on the shoulder, and informed him of my insight. He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of anguish and ""don't - talk - to - me - or - I - will - murder - you"" on his face before bursting out laughing. Clapping me on the back, he said with a smile: ""You always know how to make us laugh"". Suddenly, it dawned on me that my banter and dripping sarcasm was quite often the one thing keeping smiles on my teammates' faces. I was able to use laughter to diffuse tense situations, and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manner. We lost the game. In fact, we lost all but one game the entire season; and so I made it my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times. As the weeks went by, I started to feel more and more an integral part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration, and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities. And so laughter was. Some players had quick hands, others had a flawless shot. Me? I made people laugh. I gave my peers, my friends, the ability to see light in even the most dire of situations. I didn't receive an award, a recognition of athletic ability. Instead, I found the satisfaction of making people smile, of watching the enraged despair on their faces disappear, replaced with optimism and hope. Laughter is what pushed my teammates past anger, to be the best they could be. So, you tell me: Is laughter simply noise that a person makes when something is funny, or is it something more? Spoiler alert: It's much, much more."
569	21431	8	3	"Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have you ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell you about the time my friend fell into an icy pond. In early [Month, Year], my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches overnight. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, but she was from [Location] and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things she wanted to do that day, she let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell she just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course, she knew it was going to be cold, but I didn't think she knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what she might be expecting. We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: thick socks, warm pants, cozy shirts, and heavy jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill, she spotted the small pond on the lower half of my property and rushed towards it. She asked if we could go swimming. I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, ""heck no!"" She walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. She said that if I didn't go with her, she would push me in. So I took a step back. She just looked down and continued walking. As she stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice, she got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was ""fun."" I laughed at the funny movements she was making and whispered, ""You're going to fall."" All of a sudden, she slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion. I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before she fell into the freezing water. She fell through, and I rushed over to help her out. I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had pulled her onto the log, and we both burst out in laughter... although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing were soaked, I knew she was definitely going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience. Walking up to the house, she giggled, ""I should have listened to you, huh?"" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer. We changed into warm pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will always remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it."
570	21432	8	3	Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen, and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron - clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with [Boyfriend's Name]. One [Date] evening, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over to meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous
571	21433	8	3	"A sunny Saturday The shopping mall was a warm Saturday, some of my friends and I had planned to spend a sunny Saturday at the shopping mall. We had decided on walking around and looking at all the cool stores. Eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the shopping mall. We all agreed that this was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful Saturday. To start off, we all met at the bus stop by the movies. Sarah, Tom, Lisa, Jake and I were all there. We decided to go look inside Crazy Stuff first because they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress that was to die for. It was small and grey with skulls all over it. Unfortunately, it costed $50 that I did not have, so we left Crazy Stuff. Next, we went to Build-a-Bear to see what they had in store for us. Sarah and I created a black teddy bear with a studded leather jacket. We gave it an awesome top hat and named it Punk Bear. We all thought it was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary. We paid $30 for it and continued on our little adventure. We all decided it was about lunch time so we went and got Chinese food from Panda Express, left the shopping mall, and headed down to the park next to the river. Before we got to the park, we stopped to go see what it was like under the bridge. There were towers of rocks all over the place, so we decided to build one of our own. We stacked it up almost as tall as me before it toppled over, almost crushing Tom on the way down. We followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river. It led us to a little beach next to the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park. After eating lunch, we were all full of energy again. Jake started a pine cone war by tagging me in the back of the head with one. After a few minutes, all of us were involved. We used the giant pillar from the bridge as a shield but it didn't quite work. Tom, who had a better aim than all of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up on him. We all threw pine cones one after the other until Tom had to start backing away. As he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a big rock and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly, we all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before Jake finally decided on helping Tom out of the water. He was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased. Jessica had managed to get a video of the whole thing and when we played it back to Tom he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately, we all ran for the slide. ""I wanna go first!"" screamed Sarah as we all made it up the jungle jim to the slide. All of us pushed and shoved to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, swirly slide all together. Everyone else thought it was a great idea so we attempted it. Sarah was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by Lisa, Tom, and then Jake. We started off really slow and progressed in speed as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended in a pile at the bottom, all laughing hysterically. When we all came back to reality we realized it was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, it had turned out to be an even better Saturday than we had expected. The whole Saturday was full of joy and laughter, which are a few of the key aspects of life. Without laughter, there would be no way to express when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need to live a fun, fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun to have around. Do you think you laugh often enough?"
572	21434	8	3	"The time I went four - wheeling! One time when I went four - wheeling with my friends, Sarah, Mike, Dave, Tom and I, we went up the mountain. This is the arrangements of who was in what trucks. It was me and my buddy Jack in my big Ford F - 150, Dave and Tom in his tracker, and Sarah and Mike in his four - wheel drive jeep Wrangler. When we started to head back down the mountain, Sarah let Mike drive down. Mike can't see very well at night because he wears glasses and his eyesight's not very good. Well, I was following them down the mountain and we finally got to the pavement and Mike was going pretty fast for that road because it's a narrow curving road and that was the first time he had ever been on it before. He went to go around a really sharp corner and got up on two wheels and flipped over right in front of me so I had to slam on the brakes so that I wouldn't run into them. So I shut my truck off, ran over there as fast as I could and helped Mike out of the truck and when I turned back around to go help Sarah out, she's already on top of the truck. She looks at Mike and says ""Look at what you did to my truck, I have tried many of times to roll it and never have been able to, god damn you!"". So we all started laughing and then I got a chain out of the back of my truck and pulled him back over. Then it was really quiet and Tom farted and we all started to laugh again. Well then Sarah found out that she got a hole in her radiator, I had to pull her back to her house and it seemed like the longest drive ever because her truck weighs way more than mine so I had to pull her home in four - wheel drive and you can't go over thirty in four - wheel drive because stuff can break. So we finally get to her house and her dad comes outside and he saw the truck and was really pissed because he gave that truck to her for a graduation present and she messed it all up. Then he finally cooled off because he said no one was hurt and he was glad for that so we went in the house and ate dinner and went to bed. So the moral of the story is be very careful because things can happen when they are unexpected."
573	21436	8	3	We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. It's truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someone's day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person you're not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and it's a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hang out with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little. A famous comedian always gets nervous before one of his shows, and it just so happens that laughter is something he uses to shake off his butterflies. It's quite amazing how laughter can help you in many situations. Do you ever find yourself feeling down or stressed? Have you had a good laugh recently? Laughing will probably help. If you are having trouble bonding with a friend or simply having a bad day, laughter will be a great cure. Laughter is great for your health, and laughter has helped me in my life so far. And whether you realize it or not, laughter helps you too. Your laughter can help others too! Next time you feel down or need something to lift your spirits, have some fun with friends or do something you enjoy that might give you a good laugh. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful tool that can enhance our lives in numerous ways, and we should embrace it more often.
574	21437	8	3	Laughter is the most important part when you meet other people. Even a light smile can change the image of a whole person. Sometimes, people practice their laughter to get a better image of themselves. I believe that every person contains their own personality in their laughter. How you laugh is the way to express how you feel. For example, you can tell you are not comfortable by chuckling nervously, or you can tell it wasn't actually funny sarcastically by laughing without any tone or emotions like a robot. You can tell lots of things with a laughter. Usually, friendships are made automatically when two people have something in common and agree with each other. And a laughter is the best way to agree with somebody else. As an Asian, I had a very hard time expressing my emotions with my laughter. As I know, many Western people don't know that Asians can't smile as well as white people because their facial muscles are not very much developed. That's why other people think Asians are always angry and don't like humor. Thanks to that, I had lots of misunderstandings about my laughter. When I laugh, I don't look like I'm laughing which makes an unnatural laughter. When I first got here, it was in the middle of the semester and I couldn't speak English as well as I do now. I had no friends at all. It was a really hard job becoming a friend of someone without knowing what they know, or what their sense of humor is. In Asia, I usually made friends by making them laugh, but in here, I didn't know how to make them laugh. I had to listen to them quietly about what they were laughing about, and I had to figure out what kind of sense of humor they had. Finally, when I made one friend, I still couldn't laugh. I didn't understand any of the words they were talking about. I didn't know when to laugh and where to laugh. It seems quite silly when I look back then right now, but I was really serious. I really missed Asia where I had friends I could understand and laugh together. Living without a sense of humor made me very depressed. I suddenly stopped laughing at all because I thought laughing alone would look stupid. I kept searching about this country's culture, and I tried to watch television more to learn what they have in their heads. And then, I finally understood those slang words they used and I could laugh when others laughed. I was really happy. I was so happy that I could make other people laugh. I made lots of friends and I laughed with them. But I still couldn't understand some of the language or some other things they laugh about, but I just laughed when they laughed. It made me feel I was one of them when I laughed with them, and I was really happy about it. There was a research about laughter and life, and it said that you live longer when you laugh more. They say that even fake laughter can fool your brain and it can be healthy. Then I saw a doctor who can cure people only by laughter. There are some groups of people who laugh together to be healthy. They gather around and start laughing. It was really strange when I first saw that group on TV, but I saw people's effort to be healthy. I figured that fake laughter makes everyone happy, and laughter can cover every person's mistake. I also figured that there are still many ways to laugh in this world. By a small laughter, or even a fake laughter, we can make a better society and live a better life. In conclusion, laughter is a universal language that can bridge cultural gaps and bring people closer together, and we should all strive to share more laughter in our lives.
575	21438	8	3	Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my friends tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your friends. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your friends are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh. My best friend Lily and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year, Mrs. Smith, always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when Lily and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the TV show Friends. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if I was kicking something. Now that's when my friends start laughing more because they say
576	21440	8	3	"Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Throughout life, people often underestimate the true power of laughter. It's a simple yet profound force that can transform our experiences. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a strong bond that another person and I can relate to at a deeper level, enabling us to share our innermost thoughts and our most genuine feelings through laughter. Laughter is incredibly important throughout life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good, long - lasting relationships between compatible people, and it helps create stories that are fondly recalled later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one special person or that wonderful group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups, laughter is a common and cherished thing between all of these group members. Without this similar interest in laughter, it would seem like a vital part of life would be missing. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co - workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and the pure enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have truly good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have passed away. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all - terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath - taking. The one thing that has been breath - taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the precious times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used on a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an essential element to a relationship that should always exist, as it enriches our lives and the connections we make."
577	21441	8	3	"An argument is defined as ""A discussion in which disagreement is expressed."" In many cases, a proverbial ""@CAPS1"" is created between the two conflicting parties. This gap can seem insurmountable at times. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will not come to a settlement, and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view. Laughter, can serve as this bridge. The door slammed shut and I went straight to my room. I had returned home from what had started out as a great time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back I do not remember what it was about, all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again; but being as young as I was, these such thoughts rarely last. I would see him every day during the school week, but it would not matter whether he was there or not. He was absent to me as long as we fought. This seemed like a good plan, to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go quite as well as you want them to, especially when you are in the same elementary school, and in the same class.  In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were many group activities, and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with, things become difficult. Whether it was to build something, write together, or solve a math problem as a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and us fighting did not affect the group well. We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with, and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting persisted. At recess we would not agree to be on the same team, or even be on the same side of the field as one another. After about a week of this, I realized this needed to stop. At recess, I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at, or ignoring each other. The calm resolution to the problem started out well, but being children, ended in a shouting match, to which I lost. I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this. When I got home that day, my mother, being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong, asked me what was bothering me. I was resistant at first to explain things, but, being a mother, she talked me into telling her. She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences, which I had already tried. I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech. By the time she was done, all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again. The next day at recess, I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today, no matter the circumstances. When I found him and attempted to talk things out, it once again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it. Suddenly, in the midst of the yelling, my friend, with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing. I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter. Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary, only a few snickering bystanders. I ran what had just occurred back through my mind. Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This realization caused me to laugh, and everyone else nearby to laugh. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start. We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this. After about five minutes of talking, we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other. When a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended, I walked back to class feeling happy, and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends. If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight, I am not sure if we would have made up, even in the event we realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you. However, laughter can create a bridge across the @CAPS1, and provide a common ground in which problems can be effectively solved, bringing harmony back into our relationships."
578	21442	8	3	Laughter @CAPS1. Every time I first meet someone, there is always a small, almost invisible wall to climb before we can really get to know each other. I have this weird, awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear myself. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster as it shows my light - hearted side. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me.  When someone first meets me they usually always comment on @CAPS2 laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, as if it's an unexpected quirk, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: how odd it is, how much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by @CAPS2 laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just how bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with @CAPS2 youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town and took videos of different things, actions, situations, and people. One of these things we had to get a video of was one of us playing rock paper scissors with a stranger. So I promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just how weird @CAPS2 voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was really weird! Another situation was working at @LOCATION1 this @DATE1. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on @CAPS2 team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of @CAPS2 laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on how people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in each other's joy, which can strengthen our connections and make life more enjoyable.
579	21443	8	3	"Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the latter. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activities, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice - versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adamant about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticence. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. Then you saw her smile. She shortly proceeded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now every time I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten. It serves as a powerful indicator of the depth and authenticity of our relationships."
580	21444	8	3	I was hanging out with my friends and we were sitting at the park just talking about life and school. I guess you could say it was a really fun time. So we started to play games and run around, laughing so hard that we were sure we were going to have to go to the bathroom when we got home. We got
581	21446	8	3	Once, a very long time ago, I had a moment of uncontrollable laughter with a friend. It was in the school hallway when some kid, running in a hurry, hit the floor hard after slipping and started to cry loudly. There was a large puddle of water on the ground, and he was completely soaked from head to toe. The janitor, who was busy wiping the floor with a wet mop, had put up no warning signs. The kid was so engrossed in his own world that he was not paying any attention at all to the janitor's presence. The janitor was also a rather mean - spirited person, as he was still mad at the boy for stealing some cleaning supplies from the school janitor's closet a few days ago. The boy, in turn, was also mad because the janitor had been very harsh to him. I was in @NUM1 grade at that time and didn't know any better, so I burst out laughing. However, the teacher caught me and my friend laughing. She sternly told me that the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt extremely bad and apologized right away. I gently told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just an involuntary reaction. To my surprise, the boy was able to laugh at himself, and from that day on, he and I became friends. I firmly feel that this small event in my life has changed me for the better. I am no longer so quick to laugh at others' misfortunes. @CAPS1, people make mistakes all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in their own way. The world will never be completely harmonious; there will always be some form of conflict on earth, but we should still be kind to one another.
582	21447	8	3	A time when laughter has brightened one of my relationships was on a gloomy, rainy @DATE1 @TIME1. I had just groggily woken up, and my dad asked me to make him some breakfast. As I was carefully making the hash browns, fluffy eggs, and crispy toast, I started to reflect on how little time me and my dad spent together. Our father - daughter relationship was so unsteady and rocky, like a boat on a stormy sea. I thought of all the wonderful things we could do together, like going to the movies, having a picnic in the park, or just chatting over a cup of coffee. When I brought his breakfast up to him, I nervously proposed the idea of going to the movies. He simply said he would think about it and then told me to go get started on my chores. After what seemed like ages, when I was finally done with all my chores, I logged onto Facebook and started chatting with my cousin @CAPS1. I excitedly told him how thrilled I was to go with my dad to the movies and how we were finally going to spend more quality time together. By the time it reached five o'clock in the afternoon, full of anticipation, I went back upstairs to talk to my dad. I asked him what time we would be leaving, and he casually said around eight. That's when a sinking feeling settled in my stomach, and I had a hunch that we were not going to go after all. I slowly walked out of his room and strolled down the stairs, feeling my eyes swelling up with tears. I curled up in my @CAPS2 - boy chair in the living room and waited for eight o'clock to come. When it finally did, I was filled with deep disappointment. My father said we would go the next day, but he was going to bring a friend. Since his friend was going to see his daughter (who was also my friend since the age of three) at her gymnastics meet, I didn't mind seeing the meet or her. However, I did have a big problem with someone else coming with my dad and me to the movies. I desperately wanted to spend quality time with him, just the two of us. It made me incredibly upset that my dad didn't seem to want the same. We hardly even talked, which is so hard to do when you live under the same roof. I went back downstairs and climbed back in my chair and cried. I started to think that it must have been my fault, that I did something wrong. So I got up and talked to someone I knew could help me out of the dumps. It's my cousin. We have a very strong relationship that is filled with almost nothing but laughter. At first, he tried to reassure me, but it didn't work. Then, he did what he does best - he started doing and saying silly random things. He even joked that he would eat my poor little kitty if I didn't smile for him. That's when I started giggling, and he kept going to keep me laughing until the only tears I was crying were from trying to breathe. He always has been the one who can always turn my frown upside down. And I can do the same for him. He @MONTH1 be my cousin, but he's also my best friend, and that makes me feel the love I need from my family that only he can give me. I hope I will never ever forget or lose that special bond with him. Laughter truly is an essential part of our relationship, and it has the power to heal even the deepest of wounds.
583	21448	8	3	A time when laughter was a significant element in a shared experience was when my brother showed a hilarious YouTube video to our family. The video featured a guy recalling his childhood memory. He told how his dad had sent him to the store to get bread for dinner sandwiches and strictly warned him not to get into any trouble. To avoid trouble, his dad pointed out that there were three boys down the block who looked like troublemakers and told him to go across the street. So, the boy obediently went across the street. But as he was passing by the boys, one of them suddenly yelled out something. In an instant, a bunch of their friends came running out from a barbershop across the street and surrounded him. The boy was terrified but managed to break free and ran as fast as his little legs could carry him. He described his run so vividly, saying that he was running so fast that he knew he passed a @ORGANIZATION1. He said he was behind it one moment and then, in a flash, he was in front of the car, still running desperately to get to his house. When he finally reached his house, out of breath, he told his dad that he had done what he was told. The dad, however, was only worried about whether he got the bread. The boy was so upset that his dad was more concerned about the bread than his safety. The way the guy recounted his childhood memory was so funny, with all the exaggerated gestures and comical expressions. Even though my brother had shown me the video the night before, we both still found it incredibly funny, and so did my family. We would burst out laughing at different parts of the story, especially when the boy described his wild run and his dad's non -chalant reaction. Laughter filled our living room, and it was a wonderful moment of togetherness, reminding us that sharing funny stories can bring a family closer.
584	21449	8	3	"One day, my friend Spencer and I were waking up late in the day. Suddenly, his two - year - old brother came bursting into the room, screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs, ""bro bro""! This was the cute nickname he used for Spencer. Spencer quickly calmed him down, and then we settled down to watch TV. We started talking about what we were going to do for the day. We threw out all sorts of ideas, like going to the arcade, playing basketball, or just hanging out at the park. Finally, we came up with a plan where we were going to swim later in the day and play some video games first. Spencer's mom then asked us when we were going to swim and reminded us that we had to take his little brother. So, we decided to go early so his little bro could have fun in the pool, and we could just sit around by the pool, listening to music. Unlike most people who use an iPod, I prefer using my phone because it allows me to text and listen to music at the same time. Plus, when someone calls, the music automatically shuts off, so I'll know. It was a brand - new phone, and I was really loving every moment of having it. After we dropped his little brother off at a friend's place, we went back to the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I carefully placed my phone on my shirt and covered it with a towel. Then, when Spencer got out to use the towel, he carelessly jerked it out. In an instant, my phone flew up, hit the ground, and slid across the floor all the way to the edge of the hot tub. That moment, I looked down and panicked. I quickly took it out, ripped the back off, and frantically dried the battery with the towel, hoping it would still work. But it just kept dialing zero and nine non - stop. So, I took the battery out again. When we got back to his mom's place, I plugged in the charger without the battery. Spencer kept saying sorry, and I kept reassuring him, ""it's ok"". The next morning, his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice to dry the phone. We all started laughing because we had freaked out so bad over a phone. After that, I completely forgot about the phone and just kept laughing. And surprisingly, the phone ended up working. It is definitely one of the funniest stories in my life, a reminder that sometimes, small mishaps can turn into great memories."
585	21450	8	3	"@DATE1 was truly an unforgettable night! Me and my friends were all excited to go to a @CAPS1 party at our dance coach's workplace. We had to dress up as cute little elves and play with the kids at the party. It was a lot of fun interacting with the kids, but after we were done with the party, that's when the real adventure began! After we quickly changed out of our elf costumes and back into our regular clothes, we started taking pictures. There were all kinds of pictures - funny ones where we were making goofy faces, cute ones where we were hugging each other, and weird ones where we were doing strange poses. Anyway, my friends and I didn't want the fun to end just yet, so we decided to go to some places to take more pictures and have even more fun! Our first stop was a school playground, but it was already quite late, and we weren't allowed inside. So, we decided to head to the discovery park. I was driving, and one of my friends in the passenger seat was enthusiastically taking pictures. The pictures turned out really funny, with the blurry images of the passing trees and our excited faces. When we got to the park, my friend who was taking the pictures asked, ""@CAPS2 Can I drive around the parking lot?"" I casually said sure. We quickly switched spots, and off we went. She was a pretty good driver, but there were some really scary moments. I felt like we were going to crash into the parked cars or something. @CAPS3, it was a bit nerve - wracking. She drove around and then stopped at the stop sign by a main road. That's when she decided it would be a good time to switch back. I was yelling at her, ""@CAPS3's a car coming, we @CAPS2 get in trouble"", but she just wouldn't listen to me. She opened the door and got out. So, then I had to get out too. We were yelling at each other, and my friends in the back seat were also yelling, not because we were mad but because we didn't want to get caught and we were having a blast. So, I got back in the driver seat, and we were all yelling, ""get in the car"". But she was laughing so hard that she said, ""I wet my pants."" We all started laughing, thinking she was kidding, but no, she was serious. She was laughing so uncontrollably that she actually wet her pants! It was a good thing she had extra pants with her. So, I had to carefully back up the car so she could change behind a big metal thing. As she was changing, we thought it would be really funny if we got a picture of her changing. So, I grabbed the camera and stuck it out the window, but it was really dark. Even with the flash on, the picture didn't come out. She was still laughing so hard that we playfully teased her, saying, ""keep it in"". We still tease her a lot about it even though it's been two months. Whenever we are laughing really hard and someone says, ""oh, I think I'm gonna pee my pants"", we look at @PERSON1 and say, ""@PERSON1 knows what that's like"". This night has become a cherished memory, a reminder that laughter can turn an ordinary night into an extraordinary one."
586	21451	8	3	A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  For me, laughter is an incredibly huge part of life. I simply cannot, nor do I wish to, escape it. @CAPS1 is fun in and of itself. It always has the remarkable ability to make tense situations become relaxed and truly enjoyable. No feeling is more perfect than falling head - first into uncontrollable laughter. @CAPS1 is the absolute best way to unite people together, form wonderful memories, and build strong bonds. In my home and family, too many situations arise that hold the potential, and often result, in laughter. It's the same way with my extended family, like my friends at school. Life growing up with a lively brother, wonderfully fun neighbors, and cousins has produced most of my @CAPS1 memories. One such time, when laughter flowed freely, happened rather recently. The situation began when my brother, @PERSON1, had to do a school assignment. @PERSON1 was assigned, by his rather strict history teacher, to write a diary entry as if he were a mountain man in the @DATE1's. I didn't initially set out to help him with his homework, but considering the end result, I was thoroughly glad I did. It seemed so unlikely that this task would turn out to be so much fun. I guess that just shows how laughter can crop up so suddenly and in such unpredictable places. I came into @PERSON1's room and he told me what he was working on, so I leaned over his shoulder and helped him with a few ideas. We were making good progress and once reaching a certain point, we both contributed to a subtly humorous comment we decided to add to the entry. Reading our creation, nothing less than an explosion of laughter was triggered. The noise poured out of @PERSON1's room like lava from a volcano! My parents could hear us and likely thought we were crazy! Another person reading our literature might not have laughed at all, but to us it was absolutely hilarious. Being in a good mood, and considering @PERSON1's history teacher said to make the entries creative, more humorous and quite witty sentences were added. By this time I was doubled over, struggling to speak through all the @CAPS1 I was consumed by. @PERSON1 was hardly any better. Homework had @CAPS3 been more fun. We finished quicker than if @PERSON1 was working by himself and came away with the greatest feeling. @PERSON1 ended up getting full points on the entry when he turned it into his teacher.  This is just one example of thousands I could think of in which laughter @CAPS4 the moment. This particular instance helped with work and yet @CAPS4 the work not a chore, but rather a tremendously happy event. Perhaps more laughter in the workplace would lead to better production. All things considered, laughter, in my opinion, makes for the greatest @CAPS2.
587	21452	8	3	I believe laughter is an extremely important part of any relationship. In all my relationships, whether it's with friends, family, or a girlfriend, laughter is always an essential element of all of them. The best relationship I have is with my best friend @PERSON1 and it is filled with non - stop laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends. I tore ligaments in my knee when I tried to jump @PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being so stupid and getting hurt for it. We also laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant. I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met, she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was crack a funny joke that made her laugh. Ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest with her and I agreed. I made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip. The moral of this story is the more you make people laugh, the stronger and closer the relationships you will have, whether it be with friends, family, or a significant other.
588	21453	8	3	Just One @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5 On the @DATE1, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1 and I walked under the cover of the tall trees. We decided to stop by the lake, in our usual meeting place where we have a perfect view, to have a good chat. @LOCATION1, who is six foot @DATE1, has long raven - black hair that just barely tickles his chin, deep blue eyes that sparkle in the sunlight, and is extremely attractive. He plopped down in the wet green grass. But @PERSON2, who is six foot, has short brown hair and dark ocher - colored eyes. He chose to stand about @DATE1 paces in front of us. To any person strolling by, he would have looked @CAPS5 if he was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal - clear water, but to us, who knew him all too well, we knew he was thinking about his brother, @PERSON1, who was in the hospital. @PERSON1 had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He got in the middle of a homeless person's fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch - blade. @PERSON2 felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and this made him so depressed that he would not @CAPS1 at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. @PERSON2's feeling that way made @LOCATION1 and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. @PERSON2 was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly do to make him feel better, or, at the very least, get him to @CAPS1 again. But not once could we budge him, or even get one little giggle out of his tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up. In fact, we tried for days on end to get him to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up @CAPS5 teletubies, went to @PERSON2's house, dragged him off of his couch, and took him downtown. Yet not one second of it did his mouth even twitch upwards. Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we thought about it for days. We got absolutely no response what - so - ever out of him, except, of course, his enormous yawns. Finally, about @DATE1, we got him to giggle, which eventually turned into a full - on, body - shaking @CAPS1. You will never guess what finally got him to crack. @CAPS6 - @CAPS6 joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic @CAPS6 - @CAPS6 jokes are what got to him. Although @LOCATION1 and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but @CAPS1 with him. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for him. @PERSON2 was almost, but not quite, back to his normal self. So our lives went on, and @PERSON1 got out of the hospital perfectly fine.
589	21454	8	3	"Sometime life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. This is a short glance of my childhood. I think the best place to start is the beginning. When I was about @NUM1 years of age, I had my first vivid memory. My dad, @PERSON3, my brothers, and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION1. We were racing @CAPS1 boats that my dad had carefully built. We would go there every other @DATE1 after school, from the moment I got out of school till it was so dark outside you couldn't see your hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going was the time my brother decided I needed to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS9 loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, and there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON2 jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile, my brother @PERSON1 was on his hands and knees waiting for me to jump so he could make me trip over him. Well, I did. There was a drop - off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into my stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS2! I was now soaked, laying there like a gooey green monster. At the moment, no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night, no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers, and @PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that luminous sight. As years passed, things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren't quite as easy. There wasn't a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and I didn't know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON2 went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS5 player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, and the top bunk was nearly touching the ceiling. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up, he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news, I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little while. I was cold so he offered me a blanket I got him last @CAPS6. It was fuzzy, thick, and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys, he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there, he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn't let him. I didn't think it was right. But then he pinned me down with his leg across mine. I didn't scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn't. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn't read me a bedtime story. A few months later my brother @PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS7 ""@CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's."" @CAPS9 look like a @ORGANIZATION1 that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside was full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, ""I will give you one box of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice."" I didn't know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This interaction went on for about a year. He never did anything too invasive. After all this stuff happened, I really didn't know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong, I cried but that didn't help. So I tried laughing and it worked. Knowing that laughter is a key part in forgetting things, helped me move on."

How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of his smile will last in me forever. @DATE1 was the special day I met him.

591	21457	8	3	"Like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that truly keeps me going. Without laughter, I'm completely depleted. I'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. First is @CAPS1 mom. (@LOCATION1) @CAPS1 mom is the one who showed me that laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact that you're silly and you messed up, but make sure to get back up. @CAPS1 mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS1 teenage ""drama"" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore, to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS1 best friend got into a fight @TIME1 @DATE1, I didn't come out of @CAPS1 house for about a week and a half. I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS1 friends. @CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her, but I never did. Till one day, @CAPS1 mom sat down on @CAPS1 bed and said, ""@CAPS2, it's not what happens to you; it's what you do with it. Do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad, and happy... that's what I want you to do. No matter what is going on in your ""drama"" teenage life, don't shrug it off, @CAPS2. Laugh it off and call her."" @CAPS1 @CAPS5 friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS1 friends, I also have @CAPS5. When I'm with them, nothing else phases me. The whole world could be ending, and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS5, I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS1 friends with @CAPS5. @CAPS1 friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I are hanging out, it doesn't matter who we're around, we make their day. We can't help feeling goofy, plus the non - stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not. Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny, I'm not that funny, but when I don't try, I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS1 whole life, I've been told, ""@CAPS2, wow, you really are something. No matter what mood someone's in, you just make life seem so amazing."" @CAPS11 people laugh is one thing, but @CAPS11 myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1 room @TIME1, I was thinking about @CAPS1 past life and became pretty upset. But to pull myself out of the negative thinking, I started thinking about the good times I've had, and within five minutes, I was laughing so hard @CAPS1 stomach hurt. Like I said, ""like all great things"", laughter is @CAPS1 greatest. Laughing really can open someone's eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes. Laughter will always be a precious part of my life."
592	21458	8	3	"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all are very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of interaction with someone. Laughing says, ""what you are saying is funny"" or, ""I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. It's so obvious because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them, right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that. We love the feeling we get when we are with them, and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe it's a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe it's at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, it's always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. I'm not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, I feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps, what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh, right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right. So, let's always keep laughter in our relationships."
593	21459	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter can be used in many different ways. You could either laugh because something is funny, to be rude, or just because you enjoy what people are doing and @CAPS3 brings a smile to your face. Sometimes we shouldn't laugh at other people because @CAPS3 could hurt them even more than we imagine, and @CAPS3 could even affect their life as they grow older. When I was younger, I faced a situation which affected me as I grew up. I have always enjoyed singing ever since I could remember, but up to one point, I couldn't bear to sing in front of a crowd or even my family. I was about four years old. It was a dark @DATE1 @TIME1. My family decided that we were going to go out to have some fun at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. This @ORGANIZATION1 was where family and friends could get together to have a great time. There would be a band playing, bright round colorful tables to sit at, drinks, and it had a game room for the children to play at. My cousin's and their band were going to play that @TIME1. My family and I got all dressed up. I wore a beautiful white dress that my mother had chosen for me to wear. I looked like a star in my own eyes and I was satisfied. When we arrived, my family and I sat at a bright, lime - green, glow - in - the - dark, round table and watched the performance. I danced with my parents for a long time and then I would play games with my brother and friends. My cousin who is the lead singer of the band was calling out in the microphone if anyone would like to sing a @CAPS1 to the crowd. I ran to my parents and told them that this was my chance to shine and that I wanted to do it. They smiled at me and said, ""yes, sweetheart, of course you can do it!"" As I ran up to where my cousin was standing, I pushed through the bundle of children so that I could be in the front. I looked up, smiled, and raised my hand at my cousin, shouting for her to choose me. My cousin smiled back and picked me up and placed me on the speaker! I was so delighted, I couldn't even breathe. It was my biggest dream to stand up here with a microphone in my hand. As I stood on the big speaker box, I looked at the crowd of people and took a deep breath and I began to sing. I was singing my most favorite @CAPS1 that I knew by memory. The crowd smiled and clapped, but as soon as I sang the chorus of the @CAPS1, everyone started to laugh. I didn't know why they were laughing. Was it because I accidentally forgot to take my gum out of my mouth? Because I did happen to forget. Or was it because I sounded really bad? I was so scared. The gum that I was chewing in my mouth started to harden and my voice grew faint. I began to panic. My eyes started to become watery. I noticed tears coming down all over my face. I couldn't even bear being up in front of all these people if they were going to laugh at me. So I jumped off the speaker, ran to my mother, and began to cry in her lap. I cried for a long hour. My family tried telling me that everything was fine and that I did a magnificent job, but it wasn't enough for me to believe it. Over the years, I always detested singing in front of people. It scared me just having the thought of maybe someone would burst out laughing because I was either bad or off - key. After that, I always began to tell myself that I had a horrible voice and I knew that was the reason why the crowd at the @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at me. Every time my parents would ask me to sing a @CAPS1, I would tell them, ""no thank you, I don't like to sing anymore."" It wasn't true at all. I lied about it to my own parents, but I still had that horrible feeling in my heart and soul. Now that I am older, I understand why I was so terrified, and the reason why the people laughed wasn't at all what I thought it was. My parents told me that it was because the people thought that I was adorable, and since I was young, I couldn't really pronounce some words right. I giggled at it, and now I just keep telling myself that I can sing because nothing else is going to bring me down, and I am trying to stay positive about it. It's still very hard for me to sing a solo, but after a certain period of time, I will have the strength and courage to sing to anyone. Laughter should never be used to hurt others, as I learned from this experience."
594	21460	8	3	"I am going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and how I used to go on long trips with my father because he was a long - haul truck driver. Me and my dad went many places around the @LOCATION2, all of them being very fun and amazing. And we all had a lot of laughs. The one that I liked the most though was when we went to @LOCATION1. That place was so amazing. There are so many things to do, as well as so many things to visit. Things that you could just see like the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, which I thought was pretty cool, and all of the monuments. My dad told me to go and see if I could get past security at the @ORGANIZATION1, and I was like, ""nah, I am good. You can though,"" and I laughed at him. Another place that I liked a lot that we went to would have to be @LOCATION3. Even though it was very hot and muggy, it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to be taking us to the zoo. Man, was that cool! We got to see all of the awesome animals such as the lions, the crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas, and the penguins. It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on. I liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that I do remember is when we were driving through the desert and there was this paper in the air. I did not know what it was, so I was like, ""dad, what is that?"" And he says, ""that is a falling star."" I was like, ""in the middle of the day?"" And it took me till about a couple of years to figure out what it really was. But now I know what it was, and I just look back to that day and laugh. These trips with my dad were full of precious memories that I'll cherish forever."
595	21462	8	3	There was a memory of mine that was full of laughter and fun. Then it also turned into
596	21463	8	3	"@NUM1) I heard one true story about one normal @CAPS1 businessman. He wasn't at a very high - level position in his company; he was just an ordinary employee going about his daily work. @CAPS2 always greeted everyone in the company with his big, hearty laugh. It was a laugh that could light up the dullest of office corners. One day, the boss of the company came to the office and asked everyone, ""Who is doing the work hardest?"" @CAPS2, in that quiet moment, nobody answered that question. Then the boss said, ""Or recommend someone for a promotion."" And then, without hesitation, everyone recommended that businessman. The reason was simple: he always said hello to everyone with his big laugh, creating a warm and friendly atmosphere in the office. Eventually, he reached the highest level in his company, second only to the boss. What I'm trying to say is that laughter makes people happier. When I'm with my friends, laughter makes our friendship even stronger and more friendly. Also, laughter is beneficial for health too. If you laugh a lot, your life is likely to become much longer than before. Of course, it's good for the mind as well. That businessman wasn't necessarily an outstanding worker in terms of work - related skills. He just made everyone happier with his laughter. That's why he could reach such a high position in the company. I truly believe that laughter is really good for everything. And I also laugh a lot because I want to make people around me happier."
597	21465	8	3	"Laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Have you ever wondered whether you prefer someone who laughs a lot or a little? If @CAPS4 is the kind of person that can laugh about any and everything, then I'm sure we would get along well. Laughter plays a key part in my life. @CAPS1 is involved in about three different ways. Firstly, I joke around a lot about numerous things, whether it's a random event or a common situation. Secondly, I do funny things such as making funny faces to amuse those around me. And last, I also laugh about my own clumsiness. When @CAPS4 sees me or talks to me, whether it's for a short amount of time or a long - lasting conversation, I guarantee I can and will make @CAPS4 laugh. Laughter can be an amazing thing. In any kind of situation, like an awkward one, an embarrassing moment, or just when @CAPS4 doesn't know what to do, just remember @CAPS4 can laugh. Ever since I was a young girl, no matter where or what I was doing, I always seemed to be a huge klutz. My mom would always say, "" @CAPS4 @CAPS3 worse than a bull in a @LOCATION1 shop."" My mom was so right. Whether it was as simple as me dropping things, maybe even breaking glass, or falling, that statement was always true. All my mom could ever do when I did something like that was just laugh because she knew she had a clumsy daughter. Such as this one time when I was in elementary school, we had award assemblies every month. These assemblies were to recognize students who had been doing well that month and following the rules of a certain characteristic. This was the day I had hoped for: my name to get called. When the teachers were up on the stage calling names, I was eagerly anticipating my turn. Then, next up, my name was called. I got up, feeling extremely excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and get my award. When I had gotten up there, I got my award and then went back down the stairs. It wasn't a great idea considering how excited I was. When I was going down, I literally tumbled down the stairs. My feet missed a stair, and I went flying down on my behind. Now tell me, what would @CAPS4 do in this situation? In front of over two - hundred kids and about thirty parents? Well, I just had to laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2, get up, and go back to my seat. Another thing about laughter is that it really makes me who I am to this day. I don't know where or what I would be doing if it weren't for my clumsiness when I was younger. Laughter has brought me closer to my family and friends. They know that when I'm looking gloomy, if they want me to cheer up, they have to make me laugh. My closest friends and I joke around and laugh about numerous things. Sometimes our jokes might be a bit facetious, so we have to be careful. From my experience of being clumsy, no matter the situation, I learned that instead of being embarrassed and not wanting to bring up what happened, making it funny and something @CAPS4 can laugh about is much better. Learning from a young age to laugh and have fun, it really has made me a better person. People know me for many different things, but one of them is that I'm a happy and funny girl who laughs a lot. That is something that I'm proud of, just knowing that I can make my peers and other adults laugh and have a good time."
598	21467	8	3	It was my first year of @CAPS1, high school, and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going perfectly! I woke up on time, had a delicious breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were amazing, and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang, I quickly hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in the line. One of my close friends called my name, so I turned to wave. When I turned back, I ran directly into @LOCATION1. We collided hard. I flew backwards, dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry, but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books, I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened. After lunch, I had @CAPS2. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON1, was in it. On my way there, I made a quick stop at the ladies' room to make sure I still looked presentable and then headed to class. As I walked into the room, the first thing I saw was @PERSON1's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eyes. Then I took in the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eyelashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION1. From that moment on, it was war! As the year progressed, @LOCATION1 and I constantly tried to outdo each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON1. She always had to have the best - looking hair. I would get a cute new haircut, and she would get highlights. I received a phone, so she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with a built - in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON1 this new game I'd learned. But of course, when I walked into the room, @LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had an edge over @LOCATION1 on, books. Both @PERSON1 and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION1 jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch, I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of a sudden, @LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION1 and I stood there glaring at each other, with anger in our eyes, until someone broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon, everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION1 and me. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting, and for the first time, we were laughing together, not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up. Eventually, we became really good friends. To this day, we still laugh about our @NUM1 - grade rivalry.
599	21468	8	3	All the great memories that @LOCATION2 and I spent and shared together when we were really good best friends. We were around @NUM1 years old and in @NUM2 through @NUM3 grade. Of course, we got older as the years went by, but we had so many great times together. Whenever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time, we wouldn't let a lot of stupid things bother us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to, she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as mine, so she knew what I or even she needed to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but we always worked things out. We'd always have each other's backs for everything. I guess what I'm trying to say is that two people who are close always have their great needs, feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are some times that @LOCATION2 and I shared and spent together that led to laughter. I remember in @NUM2 grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young, so it was hard to do anything because our parents wouldn't let us most of the time. Whenever we did manage to hang out, we would think of random games and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older, we were trusted more and could do a lot more things, which was a great thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION1. It wasn't the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE1, and then on @DATE2 my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in Florence. Every night that she was there, we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocolate packages in my room. After my parents went to bed, we'd sneak out to get hot water for it so that we could have hot chocolate to drink. Some other times, we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents' room, and at the time, I had beads hanging from my door. Those were really fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over, she would bring all her makeup and things so that we could dress each other up. One night, we had blindfolds on and did each other's makeup. These memories are so precious, and they show how laughter and friendship can overcome the distance and small difficulties in life.
600	21470	8	3	Laughing is something that everyone experiences. It can transform a bad situation into a funny one. It's like magic. I mean, you don't need a wand or anything, just a unique and twisted sense of humor. You just need a bit of common sense and a touch of illogical thinking. I know those are two different things, but isn't that what makes us @CAPS4? Isn't laughter just the response to hearing something illogical that goes against your common sense? No. It's not. Laughter is also an extremely helpful tool. You can do a lot of things with laughter. You can get out of trouble, get into trouble, start a friendship, end a friendship, get a job, lose a job, win a game, and lose a game. And that's not everything, mind you. But I'm not here to talk about all of those things, just one of them: making friends with laughter. Just sit back and listen, and maybe you'll learn something. Before we begin the story, let me just start by saying that I'm not exactly the nicest guy on the planet, and I know this, but I'm good at making people @CAPS4. It's not even on purpose half of the time. The majority of my jokes and humor involve depressing things. I honestly think that's why @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or whoever invented sadists and masochists. Anyway, let's get back on track. Once upon a time, in a world where teens were desensitized to the harsh reality of modern living, there was a kid. That kid's name was @PERSON1. Now, I really hadn't known @PERSON1 for very long, and to be quite honest, I didn't really want to, but he tagged along with me, Grant, and @PERSON3 back in the day. He always wore these awesome Iron Maiden t - shirts and listened to the type of music that I liked, so I guess you could say it was fated, but that's neither here nor there. One day, we got to talking. We were both thinking about this big barrel that had been left on the track at our school. It was empty and plastic, and when you're @NUM1, everything big, red, and plastic looks fun. We decided that we would take the barrel and stand on it. Yes, that was all we wanted to do with it. It never really crossed our minds that we could have taken it or built something with it. No, the only conclusion we could come to was to stand on it. And we did. And it was a lot of fun. The next day, we came to school, and @PERSON1 was handing out invitations to his birthday party. I was pretty excited, so I went. As it turns out, our lives are very, very much alike. I think the first thing I noticed when I went to his house was the kitchen. It was like they took my kitchen, painted it a different color, and then put it there. Honestly, I thought I was the only kid who lived the
601	21471	8	3	"Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an important assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a really difficult day dealing with various stressors. All I need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when I moved to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same in a way. Some just wanted to know my name out of politeness and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before everyone would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in a few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quiet voice. I had barely understood his name, so I had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words. Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe through that friend I could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no. There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking on the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason I felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one. In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the recent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was, but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. It's been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at their jokes. I knew this was different though. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time, no matter the distance."
602	21472	8	3	"I have lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my whole life. I went to pre - @CAPS5 all the way up to @NUM1 grade, building many memories in that familiar environment. @CAPS7 was about half - way into my @DATE1 when my mom had told me the ""@CAPS3"" news. ""Honey, we are moving,"" I froze in shock. I didn't know what to think. ""No, we can't move."" ""Why?"" she said. ""Um, maybe because I'm going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I don't want to go somewhere where I have no clue who anybody is."" ""Don't worry,"" my mom said, ""you will make some friends."" ""Where are we moving anyway?"" I asked. ""Lebanon,"" she answered me in a soft @CAPS1 voice. ""Well, I guess it's not that far away from here."" ""There you go,"" she said, ""@CAPS7 won't be that bad once we get there and get everything settled in and unpacked."" ""Yeah, but I still don't know anybody there."" ""Your cousin @PERSON2 goes there and he is a junior so he could maybe drive you to @CAPS5 everyday if you wanted and introduce you to some people."" ""Okay,"" I said. I was a bit excited but also I didn't want to move away from @CAPS8. We started to pack up our things. It took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. After the house was all packed and our things were out we started to clean. We cleaned from the upstairs all the way down, thoroughly from head to toe. That took us about two days tops to do. So in all total, it took us about a week and two days to get everything packed, moved out, and cleaned. We said our emotional @CAPS11 byes to our friends and family and were on our way. ""It's not like we will never see them again,"" I said to my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house. I was so anxious to see what it looked like. My mom opened the doors. ""Go check it out,"" she said. ""Wow, this place is amazing. We love it,"" the boys said. ""I told you that you guys would love it."" We went upstairs and picked out our rooms. There was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we were all done with that we started to unpack our stuff. I was so tired from doing everything that after I was done unpacking my room I went and took a nap on my bed. When I woke up I realized that I have not unpacked everything like I thought I did, so I finished with that. @CAPS5 started in about a week. I was so excited yet nervous at the same time to see what it would be like. Finally the day was here. ""Honey, wake up. Time for @CAPS5,"" mom said. ""Already? Oh, forget it. I said I'm going to @CAPS5 no matter what."" I get out of bed, brush my teeth, hair, do my make - up and get dressed. ""@CAPS9"" ""@CAPS9"" ""@PERSON2 is here. Time to go."" I rush downstairs, get my back pack and get in the car. ""@CAPS11 morning,"" he said. ""@CAPS11 morning,"" I replied. ""You excited for @CAPS5?"" he asked. ""Yeah, kinda. Just a little nervous."" ""Don't be. I will introduce you to my girlfriend. She is a freshman also."" ""Okay,"" I said. We pull into the @CAPS5. ""Wow, that's a lot of kids,"" I said. ""Yeah, there is @NUM2 freshman this year."" We get out of the car and go inside. ""Let's go show you around to your classes."" ""Alright,"" I said. ""This is your first period. @PERSON1 she teaches @CAPS12 arts."" He shows me the rest of the six and sends me to class. I walk in. Everyone is staring at me. My stomach is turning into knots, feeling like it wants to fall out of my stomach. ""Welcome @LOCATION1. Just sit down. I will be with you shortly,"" the teacher says. She shows me where to sit and introduces me to the class. Finally the class is over, but I still have to go to six more. This day feels like it's going by so slowly. I walk to the rest of my classes wondering if they will not be that scary. But no, I was wrong. Most of the teachers made me introduce myself in the front of the class. It was terrifying! I get on the bus, can't wait to get home. I walk through the doors. ""How was your day? Did you make friends?"" mom asked. ""Mom, calm down,"" I said. ""Sorry, I just want to know."" ""My day was okay. Can I go take a shower now?"" ""Yeah, just don't take long, okay."" I get out and go lay on my bed. ""Awww, time to go to sleep,"" I thought. But no, my brothers had to come bum - rush me and tell me about their day. It was about an okay day, I thought. ""Time to go to bed."" ""@CAPS14"" ""@CAPS15"" ""Time to get up @LOCATION1."" ""Oh no, not again!"" But I knew I had to face another day at the new school, hoping it would get better."
603	21473	8	3	"When we all get together on my dad's side, we just all sit, laugh, and talk loud. I always say that we are one big fake @CAPS1 family in a fun way. All the aunts, uncles, and cousins come around my grandma's small kitchen table and talk. There are so many conversations going on and people talking loud and laughing, that to me it makes me feel like a home away from home. This was the case when some of us got together for a late birthday party for me, when I was in @LOCATION1 @DATE2. It was @DATE1. My grandma, uncle, aunt, dad, my two cousins, and I; were sitting around the kitchen table eating cake and talking. We were talking about a problem that I was having. Somehow my dad decided to pretend like we were in court. My aunt said to @PERSON2 to go and get a wig for the judge, which was my uncle. @PERSON2 brought back this blond wig and she puts it on my dad's head. He looked so funny with that wig on his head, his expression all comical. Aunt @PERSON3 was fixing the front of the wig for him. I grab his phone and start taking a bunch of pictures of him in the wig. I send one to my mom saying, ""@CAPS2 mom, dad is pretty."" We were all laughing so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Then my grandma decided to put on the wig. Grandma kept saying that it was itchy and tickling her, making funny little wriggling movements in her chair. After she took off the wig, she started to tell us a story about the time when my grandpa poked her in the left side of her rump with a compass. She first set up the story for us, by telling us who the teacher was. It was a funny @DATE2 name that I don't remember. Uncle @CAPS3 was doing an impression of what he thought the teacher would be like. His impression was like the old bank owner on @PERSON1, with exaggerated mannerisms and a funny voice. We all started to laugh really hard. When my grandma finally got to the main part of the story, he was so mad at her, because she wrote his name down for talking in class and he also liked her. So he took a compass and poked her in the rump. For some reason my dad and uncle thought it was so funny that they made her say it over and over again in a rhyme. She couldn't say ""rump"" without laughing. We all started to laugh really hard because she couldn't say rump. Grandma was laughing so hard she would fall back into her chair and I thought she was going to die of over - laughter. The laughing got so bad we were starting to cry from laughing so much. As you can see, my dad's side really likes to laugh and be funny. We are a great big fake @CAPS1 family full of love and fun. I believe that laughter is a very important part in any relationship you have with anyone you meet. One of my favorite things to do is laugh and I will most likely laugh at anything someone says. When my dad and his younger brother get together, prepare to laugh really, really hard, and those moments will always be cherished memories in our family."
604	21475	8	3	Do you remember the first day of @NUM1 grade? Everyone is awkwardly and excitedly standing there waiting for their seating arrangement. You have the middle - school jitters and everything is just happening so fast. I remember all that vividly. I went to school at @CAPS1 for my middle school years. My teacher was @PERSON3. She was the type of teacher that was strict when it came to where you sat in class. If you didn't like someone, she
605	21476	8	3	"One time I was sick, and I told my mom ""I need to get some ice tea"" so I get up and go to the freezer. Suddenly my throat gets irritated and I feel the need to cough, so I do and instead of coughing on the side I do it right into the ice bucket. And it just so happens that my mom was standing next to me, and she says ""@CAPS1 god! son what was that?"" so we started laughing. It was ironic because the germs would be preserved in the ice box it was funny I was keeping my germs alive and my mom used that ice."
606	21477	8	3	It was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1, with a biting wind that made our breaths visible in the air, when I decided to go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 with my friends @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @PERSON1, @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. We had a ride to @LOCATION1 and back so we rode along with @CAPS4's dad in his old, but reliable sedan. On the way, we listened to some A @CAPS8 @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 (which i recommend to any @CAPS12 fans). Once we got there, I told a joke about a clumsy penguin, and we all laughed so hard they all pooped themselves and died. The absurdity of the situation was almost too much to bear.
607	21478	8	3	"I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans, simply enjoying each moment as it came. Looking down on @CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS4 the year @DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4's mid - day. The sun is high in the sky, casting a warm glow over the green grass. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size @NUM1 trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place @CAPS4 hide.  ""@CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..."" ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 sister, @PERSON1, yells out @CAPS4 me from behind one of the giant oak trees. I giggle @CAPS4 myself a little and start at @CAPS8. ""@CAPS8, four.. three.. two.."" I slow down dramatically, ""ONE!"" and like a rocket, I blast off the front porch with @CAPS7 arms spread out on each side, making engine noises, and pretended I was a pilot ""@CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!"". I tackle @CAPS7 sister @CAPS4 the ground. I remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed @CAPS7 eyes and reopened them @CAPS4 find myself in @DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic happening of @NUM2. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. ""@CAPS6, look through."" @PERSON2 demanded. I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  ""@CAPS11!"" I yelled. The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next @CAPS4 us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS4 see. I pushed @CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS8 minutes. He motioned the other adults @CAPS4 see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. ""@CAPS12 did they all go?"" We panicked. Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. @PERSON2 looked toward @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked down @CAPS4 @PERSON2, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @CAPS2 cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones ""I love you"". I look down at @CAPS7 feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back @CAPS4 @DATE3. I raise @CAPS7 head up over @CAPS7 shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes @CAPS4 all seriousness, but other than that, laughing is part of humor/youth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny you don't just stand there and say that was funny and not laugh. Everyone knows that, once in a while, they have @CAPS4 take a step back and laugh. I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. I had no desire @CAPS4 impress anybody. I lived @CAPS7 childhood well and when I think about it, I just sit back, look at everything that I have done, and laugh, realizing how precious those memories are."
608	21479	8	3	Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if you're having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes, it's a very tragic thing, especially if you're really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that they're in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed to do. The complex equations and difficult problems frustrated me so much that I started to cry. I told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he wanted to take me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM2 or @NUM3 times. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk to him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me to a face - painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just to get him back. And to be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once in a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just to be brats to mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM4 grade when my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM5 hours, and talking to him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got to talk to him. Only about once or twice though. Anyway, those times talking to him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS5, she was about @NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh to help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down, and they will always remain special memories.
609	21480	8	3	Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a dog named @CAPS1. He was a friendly and energetic dog. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks in the neighborhood park, or go to the beach to watch the waves, or go to the local playgrounds. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out of his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table during our outdoor adventures. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5 - @CAPS6, popcorn, big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked like or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because I really loved my dog and I wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies I finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but they're stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 whenever he doggy - paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti - depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad I just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, they're lazy. What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 whenever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 whenever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my
610	21481	8	3	"Have @CAPS3 ever had that one moment with some that @CAPS3'll remember forever and laugh about every time @CAPS3 think about @CAPS2.? @CAPS8 I have and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in there life. On the day of @DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 decided that @CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS1 was starving and that @CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS3 @CAPS1's from @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 has @CAPS6 clue where anything is in @LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his @DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS3're probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS1 decided @CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but @CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS2 was okay, @CAPS8 as first @CAPS2 was . Until @CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said ""I told @CAPS3 that @CAPS3 needed to go right not left."" @CAPS1 then looked at me and said, ""@CAPS2's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out."" One thing that @PERSON1 did not know is that @CAPS2 had been warm in @LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON1 had one more thing that @CAPS1 wanted to try, because @CAPS6 offense but @CAPS1's a boy and they can @CAPS5 everything themselves. So @CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put @CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @CAPS1 said, then @CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS1 deserved because @CAPS1 wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @CAPS1 looked at me and said, ""@CAPS3 think this is funny?"" @CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS3 remember how I told @CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @CAPS8 when @CAPS1 pulled me out i didn't take @CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, "" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 have an extra key on @CAPS3 by chance?"" ""@CAPS6"", @CAPS1 said, ""@CAPS7?"" I looked at him and said, ""@CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS8 to finish @CAPS2 off the doors are locked."" @CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS2 unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @CAPS2 to this day."
611	21482	8	3	Laughter Was One @CAPS1'm going to write my paper on how important laughter is. I truly believe it can really cure people. Like when someone's upset, @CAPS2 just have a good hearty laugh and make yourself feel better. Ok, I know I crack a few jokes here and there, @CAPS2 because I like to laugh a lot. It feels so good, it makes me happy, and it also makes other people happy. I'm in foster care and I can't get out @CAPS2 so laughter is an important part of my life at the moment. Even if I'm down, it makes me happy to hear someone else having a good time. I miss hearing my parents laugh. My mom was an amazing mother, she had a funny laugh that would get me to grin, smile, and just bust out laughing. We always had a great time together. I remember when my mom took her meds @TIME1 and the pills made her a little hyper. @CAPS2 then my own mother wanted to box me.@CAPS2 I had boxing gloves and she just had her fists, @CAPS3 but my mom knew how to fight and everything. @CAPS2 that experience was a little scary. Ok, enough about my mom, @CAPS4 now about my dad. He was an exceptional man and father. He worked really hard to support me and my brother. When my brother and I were younger, my dad would always put on funny masks and do funny things to get me and my brother to laugh. Or he would put on a scary mask and scare us to have himself a laugh. My father would go roller - blading with us and try to trip us, but he couldn't always keep up. If you got going too fast, his legs would wobble and he would fall, and me and my friends would just laugh. After my parents passed, me and my family has been separated and it sucks, but laughter to me is their world right @CAPS4. I could have been my father's twin, think hard about that. What Laughter Is All @CAPS5 ''Laughter Is The Shortest Distance Between Two People''. And ''I @CAPS6 truly Believe Laughter Between Two Or @CAPS7 People Is An Important Part Of Any @CAPS8 Of @CAPS9.''. Laughter really is a precious gift that can bridge the gaps in our lives.
612	21483	8	3	"My grandfather always used to say, ""life is like a kaleidoscope, you can keep turning and turning and it @MONTH1 may seem like it is changing, @CAPS1 but really it's just repeating itself."" @CAPS1 Well, I have always wondered if the statement really applies to life, and if it does, why would we want life to continue in the same pattern, if it isn't going like we had planned. When I was twelve, me and my two little sisters were split up and three thousand miles were crammed in between us. I was put here in @LOCATION2 while they remained in @LOCATION1, where I was born. At first, the pain of those three thousand miles was devastating. It was like I had two of my essential organs removed from my body. Eventually, though, time passed and the agony lessened its grip on our lives. It @MONTH1 sometimes seems cruel @CAPS1 because most of the time now the thought of them doesn't cross my mind. Maybe @CAPS2 it's true what they say, ""out of sight, out of mind.""  @CAPS2 It's so sad to think of how close my sisters and I were before the change. We did absolutely everything together. We are very close in age, the youngest and I are only @NUM1 years apart. I remember all the times we would spend outside on humid @DATE1 days. We would look as white as ghosts because of all the sunscreen my mother would generously apply to our skin. Times were different then, they were happy, I was happy. If I think really hard I can see us sitting on the shag carpet in my room, playing with dolls until the sunlight melted slowly into darkness. If only I could have that moment again even for a second, then maybe I could feel that happy content feeling once again. Although much time has passed since our separation, I still have those days when I feel that my world is caving in around me because they are so far away. I'll give them a call and the questions are always uncomfortable at first, like between strangers meeting for the first time. I can feel the three - thousand - mile scab on my heart reopen and it bleeds as though I am leaving all over again. I ask myself why do I bother to call if it hurts this bad? And then I hear it, like the beautiful sound of classical music to my ears, I hear them laugh. I have that feeling I needed all of a sudden, I am happy. With every small giggle my smile grows because I know I have made them feel whole again and for a second I have let them forget about how far I really am. Their laughter makes those three thousand miles evaporate into the air. In those moments of laughter, I know that we are close again, that we are sisters, not strangers. It's true what my grandfather says, because no matter how my life changes, I will always have that feeling of total bliss when I hear the sweet laughs of my little sisters. Laughter truly has the power to overcome distance and bring back the warmth of family."
613	21484	8	3	"I rested my back on the cool steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. ""@CAPS1 This game is everything we have worked for - every excruciating practice, every tedious drill, and every game film we have studied down to the minutia. It was all to prepare us for tonight. @CAPS7 If we lose tonight, everything we have worked for was for nothing."" I listened attentively as @PERSON1, our team captain, spoke. The words she chose for our pre - game speech were straight to the point, and anything but sugar - coated. As I glanced around the locker room it was easy to observe that every one of my teammates was anxious. Emilie was vigorously chewing what was left of her nails, while @LOCATION1 preferred to show her uneasiness by the constant tapping of her foot. @PERSON1 finished her speech, and with the break of our huddle we entered the gymnasium. The stands were packed with familiar faces of our small town. In a small section of the stands there was a group of people wearing colors not native to our school. @CAPS1 This brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm - ups. The twenty minutes we had for warm - ups seemed to last no longer than two minutes. The announcer began to state our starting line - up, but it was no use. The roar of the crowd overpowered the speaker system. It seemed as @CAPS7 if everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game. Not an empty space was left in the bleachers. The bench vibrated from the stomping and clapping of the crowd, threatening with every shake to collapse. The starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip - off. With the loss of the tip - off our team was quickly put under pressure. From the first possession of the game we were chasing our opponent. The first two quarters ended with a dead - even score. Feeling discouraged my team regrouped in the locker room for @DATE2 time. We entered the locker room a moment before my @CAPS3. I took @CAPS1 this opportunity to look around at the expressions of my teammates. Nothing but disappointment and fear crossed their faces. My @CAPS3 opened the door, and I instinctively braced myself for the throwing of keys against the wall, or the smash of the clipboard. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @CAPS3 entered with complete poise and composure, as @CAPS7 if our first @DATE2 of treacherous play didn't phase him. We were not yelled at, or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down and shoulders hunched over. His belly began to shake, shortly followed by his shoulders. My first hypothesis was that he was crying, but then to my amazement, I heard the soft chuckle of our @CAPS3. Soon that soft chuckle metamorphosed into a stomach - thrusting, loud cackle. My team exchanged confused glances, and waited for my @CAPS3's explanation in anticipation. ""@CAPS2 Look at yourself!"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 firmly ordered. ""@CAPS5 You are all more tentative than when I asked @PERSON2 out to my first dance!"" We could always rely on @CAPS3 for an unrelated metaphor. Even @CAPS7 though it wasn't related to basketball, the point was clear. ""@CAPS7 If @CAPS5 you guys would just believe in yourself the way I believe in @CAPS5, @CAPS1 this game would be a blow - out! Instead, @CAPS5 you are playing like a bunch of bunny foo - foos!"" We all laughed with the thought of playing like the nursery rhyme we had heard so frequently when we were children. The speech @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gave eased us all. The confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the @DATE2. To think that @CAPS1 this confidence came from just one comforting laugh seemed almost improbable. The whistle blew to start the @DATE2. We played with such assertiveness and confidence that @CAPS7 if @CAPS5 you were to compare one @DATE2 with the other, it would @CAPS2 seem like two different teams. We grasped the lead early in the @DATE1, and sustained it for the rest of the game. The victory of that night's game lead us one round deeper into the state tournament. As I walked back to the locker room I glanced around the massive gym. I looked at the crowd, score board, opponents, referees and news reporters. I realized how easy it is to get caught up in everything that shouldn't affect @CAPS5. All the distractions easily make @CAPS5 you forget the main purpose of why @CAPS5 you play the game. Occasionally we need reminders, like the calming laugh of @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Without that reassuring laugh, my team never would have united, and defeated our opponent. Laughter can truly transform a team's fortune."
614	21485	8	3	"Freshmen year, @CAPS1 wrestling season. I have been @CAPS1 wrestling for about eight years now. I made varsity in a @NUM1 large school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 wrestling squad."" @CAPS2 As an eighth grader, I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 having a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 as easy of a time as in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 history teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 but @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 this day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 me the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in the early season. I had to just worry about the match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake - free. At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6 - @CAPS7 - @CAPS8. The match was very short - lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 but the view is excellent."" @CAPS13 This quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi - finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I saw @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 As he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 It was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says ""@CAPS11 It took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost"
615	21487	8	3	Many people @MONTH1 think that laughter is not a big part of a relationship. i truly think that have a good laugh with your spouse is a good thing because it means that you are having a good time with each other. I will tell you a true story when i and my girlfriend were laughing and having a good time, and i will talk about another time when laughter was a big part in my life. In the next @NUM1 paragraphs i will decide how laughter help @CAPS1 out a lot in my life. laughter is all about having fun and it should be meant to hurt someone or make them upset or mad at you. I think some people really mean to hurt people because they don't care what they say to others and that's why laughter sometimes can hurt people. I have said some things to people that i thought were funny but the person i was saying it to didn't think it was funny. This first story I'm going to tell you is about @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. I have been dating @PERSON2 for about a month now and laughter is a big part in our relationship. @PERSON2 and i like to tell jokes to each other and make each other laugh and smile. If we didn't laugh and have a good time with each other than were would this relationship go. It wouldn't go the way i would want it t go. So i try everyday to make her laugh and smile at some of the things that i say because its a important thing in life to @CAPS1 anyways. @PERSON2 makes @CAPS1 laugh all the time and i think thats a good thing to her because she can be a very funny person all the time. So as long relationships have some laughter in it most of them will go for a while. The one person i think that has made @CAPS1 laugh the most is probably my dad. My dad every day when he comes to pick @CAPS1 up he always has something funny to say. I don't think he has not said something funny one day for a long time. The times when my dad is having a bad day at work and then when he comes home and is still in a bad mood i try to say something funny to get him out of his bad mood, and if that doesn't work i just go to my room to get away from him. But most of the time my dad comes home in a good mood because his job is very easy and he likes the people that he works with. Now that would have been a different story if we still lived in I'm @ORGANIZATION1. When we lived in @ORGANIZATION1 my dad had to commute back and forth to work from @LOCATION2 to @ORGANIZATION1. That was about a hour drive one way, so it put him not in a very good mood.but i didn't get to really see him much when we lived over in the @LOCATION4. so anything that funny i think i always try to say just to keep the laughter going.I believe that laughter is a big part in having friends. most friends like to joke around and laugh at things that are funny to them. so when you have a friend that likes to smile or likes to tell jokes usually they become friends and that person gets more friends and they whole community starts to like him in-till he says something that makes a lot of people mad. At our baseball practices @CAPS1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @CAPS2 we like to tell jokes jokes or say something that will make the whole team laugh. another person that is funny to @CAPS1 is @LOCATION3. @LOCATION3 tells a lot of jokes and has funny face exasperation, and the last person that is funny to @CAPS1 is @PERSON1 is one of those guys that thinks he inst funny but really is. I think i have a good friend relationship with all those people.I just told you why i think a good laugh is a good thing in a relationship. It is good around your parents so you can have a good relationship with them. I hope you liked my story. I enjoyed writing on this topic because it explains about @CAPS1 and it explains what i do with my spouse and my friends. I think that everybody has laughter in there life day in and day out to keep a good attitude wit people.
616	21488	8	3	"When I was a young boy, I used to laugh at anything I could find amusing. After all, as a kid, who didn't? As I got older and matured more, I developed a great sense of humor. This sense of humor, to my advantage, made me a hit among young people. I continued to grow and my sense of humor became stronger and more confident. I could always vividly remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received because of my humor.   As my body aged and my humor became even funnier, I made myself more dependent on my people - pleasing personality. In addition, I then taught myself how to subtly alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step I knew was appropriate to further advance my humorous personality. I had no intention of losing my humor, so I used it to my advantage. I used my humor to boost my @CAPS1 count, to get attention from non - accepting peers, and to get the attention that I thrived on.   I began to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me. It seemed as if I had a lot of the attention. Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me. Whether it was rolling down stairs in a comical way, telling well - crafted jokes, making teachers a bit angry (which students thought was funny), and occasionally causing minor chaos by destroying things. All this just so I could fit into the crowd that used to reject me.  As I advanced into high school, I knew my humor needed improvement to keep my peers still laughing. I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That was when I started to ultimately lose my funny, humorous personality. I then dropped in the peer ranks, down to the kids I thought were once called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive. I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top. This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality.   One of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else, down to a level of being as unhappy as a person could be. That so - called ""@CAPS1"" took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness. I finally realized that it wasn't fun to be someone's @CAPS1 who only drags you down. I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved. I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't wanna be friends with her; it was just too hard for me. When she moved, it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor.   I had broken away from my dark days and started back on my endless trail of humor. It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed to be forever, and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain. But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humor, I had got my personality back to normal! Instantly after I regained my humor, I began to feel more happy. I received more attention and felt like I was back to where I should be, although I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back to the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles, and most importantly back to the way I used to be. I had to regain all of my humor and personality, my tones, voices, and jokes but it was worth it, in a strange way.   As I now continue my humor as a junior, I have not successfully lost it yet, but there is always a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks, then right back up again. In the end, it's not what you have that matters; it is what you can do to please yourself, and in the end, I would not change a thing!"
617	21489	8	3	In @NUM1 grade to @NUM2 grade, those were truly the happy times of my life. I had a teacher named @PERSON1. She was absolutely in love with Mickey Mouse. I often wish that sometime I could go back there.   In @NUM1 grade, when I first entered the classroom, I knew some of my friends were there, but I didn't know the teacher. I didn't know what to think of her at the start, but I knew I had to get to know her because she was going to be my teacher for @NUM4 years.   At one of my physical education classes, my P.E. teacher patiently taught me how to tie my shoes. Every day, when we wrote in our journals, we had to tell a story about something. I always talked about @PERSON2, and she would always tell me not to write about her and to tell something new.   In @NUM1 grade, my class and I got to go to a coffee shop for a field trip. It was so exciting to be out of the school and in a new place. In @NUM6, my class read over @NUM7 books and then we had a party to celebrate. Sometimes during the @DATE1 time, we all got together and we would have an ice - cream party. It was such a sweet treat.   When @DATE2 came around, we always did a musical every year. It was a great chance for us to show our talents. In @NUM8, I went to outdoor school. It was so much fun and really cool. I got to experience nature and learn new things outside of the regular classroom.   Those years were filled with so many wonderful memories. They were a special part of my life, and I'll always cherish the time I spent in those grades with that amazing teacher and my dear friends.
618	21490	8	3	Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice, quiet suburban area. The neighborhood was filled with friendly people and beautiful gardens. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible.   As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But though I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. However, the times when I was with my best friends and caring family were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.   George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, sharing our daily experiences. We text message each other every night, checking in on how the other's day went. And we hang out almost every weekend, going to movies or just walking around the park.   The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce, I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time, it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me.   He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.   A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, it's @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents' divorce. She was there with me on my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones. We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry. We re - lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one that we would always remember.   My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house.   During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling. I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie - night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.   If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart.
619	21491	8	3	"Life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration. Life is what you make it, and I have given my best efforts to achieve this goal; even when it seems senseless. It may be hard to not be affected by the world's chaos and daily epidemic, but doesn't it seem easier and less stressful to smile than to frown? To live life in the moment with no worries of what is gonna happen, just to be care - free, I would consider it exhilarating. To be in the purest form of tranquility.  My memories as a child are faint, but I am glad to say that I have some. Happiness as a child is most pure in my opinion. It was my favorite pair of plastic barbie high - heel shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on it. It was my parents making funny, exaggerated faces that made me explode in laughter because I could not possibly hold it in any longer. All I longed for was a picnic under my favorite long - green - haired willow tree. I wanted to feel as free as the birds, to sing their beautiful songs, and to dance around with a never - ending smile. It's the fragile youth of a child I longed for. It truly is a precious and fragile time.  As life goes on, my purity has faded, and the distance from people, the community, and myself has extended until I felt alone in solitude. I had changed as a person when life burned me one too many times. I felt God had betrayed me, if not hated me. I then had become a stone - cold wall that no one could penetrate. But as I gazed into the mirror, I no longer saw a @CAPS3 for life, just hatred. This moment in time changed my life perspective.  My strong hatred for the world was beginning to handicap me in various, if not most important aspects. If I couldn't open up to myself, how could I open up to the world? To @CAPS3, to learn, to be free, and to grow was my ultimate goal. Within myself, I learned the most important lesson: laughter and the willingness to be optimistic, compassionate, and understanding. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe this is an honest opinion worth trying to prove.  Laughter changed my life, my world, and it's a re - occurring symptom that I take pride in every day. In my most embarrassing moments, most angry of times, and even within my deepest sorrows, I still manage to scrape up a smile. Helping people helped me realize and understand that this is my passion. I want to help the world not hide from their pain but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright. Even within the deepest, darkest caves, there is always a rock awaiting to crumble to bring light. To me, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light, a smile can carry. I want to be that light. I want to be that relieving feeling that everything will be all right. So I live my life through a gracious smile. In my perspective, if you create a smile, you will receive three more. This is my motto, ""@CAPS3 life for what it's new adventures bring, just smile, the world will continuously turn"
620	21494	8	3	"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE1 the morning of my @NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends."
621	21495	8	3	Every one laughs. I love to laugh. In fact, that's one of my favorite things to do. If you're in a bad mood or just can't get happy, laugh at things because I'm sure it will lighten up your mood. And I'll tell you what, it's also very good for you in many ways. If people didn't laugh, then this world would be a very depressing place. You smiling at someone who isn't the happiest could totally change their mood. So, as I have told you before, I am a very happy and energetic person, and laughing is what I do best. I smile at everyone around me. Well, I have a story for you. I like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks' homes because I believe I should share my happiness with everyone else around me. It makes my soul feel good to help people out. This one afternoon, I was doing what I do best—laughing and having a good time at the old folks' home, making people smile. They all love having me around because they say I cheer them up. I run around room to room, bringing in vases of fresh flowers and opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in. I always tell them vitamin D is good to warm up the soul. There was this one man there who had never had a smile on his face. I did the same to him as I did to the other residents, and no matter what I did, he would never smile. Whenever I came in, he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face. So, I asked the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet, and they told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family, from what I understood. Or, well, at least they didn't visit him much. They just dropped him off because they didn't want to deal with the grumpiness anymore. But I have a heart of gold and I feel like I should share. I decided one day that I was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down and make him feel happy, smile, and interact with the other residents. So, as usual, I went in and did my daily routine in all the other rooms. We talked, did some laughing, and all sorts of stuff. I saved the little old man for last. I wasn't sure what his name was or what his whole background was like, but I was going to go for it! I went in, and he was staring out the window as usual. I hesitated for a minute because I didn't know how he would react. So, I went up and started talking to him. I introduced myself, but he didn't seem too pleased. I asked him his name, and he told me it was none of my business. That totally shot me down and made me feel like I was the bad guy. So, I started talking to him and asked him about his life. He slowly opened up to me and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the Vietnam War. He turned out to be a nice guy. All those nurses were wrong about him. They didn't even try. We laughed for hours, me and him, and it didn't get old. Ever since I talked to him, he has been progressively starting to interact with the others. They just didn't give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to. So, think about it next time you're going to the store and you see someone who doesn't look like they're having the best day. Shoot them a smile! It might just make their day, and yours too.
622	21500	8	3	"Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out with your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case, I am always laughing and always surrounded by people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods, and Sarah always knows how to put a smile on my face. Sarah and I hang out all the time. Every time we get together, we're constantly laughing to the point where we can't breathe. One day, we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I got a phone call from Sarah. ""Hey, what are you doing today?"" Sarah asked. ""Oh, just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied. ""Well, I'm having a bad day. Would you wanna come over or something?"" Sarah said in an upset tone. ""Sure. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents' room. My parents, of course, said yes. About an hour later, I got picked up by Sarah's dad. When I got in the car, I could just tell by the way Sarah looked that she was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house, we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started, we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. We weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. Sarah and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. Well, that day was the day. Sarah's dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""What's going on in here?"" he asked with a stern voice. ""Just having fun, dad."" We said still laughing. ""Okay, then."" he replied with a really confused face, walking out of the room and closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that Sarah fell off of her bed. ""Are you okay?"" I tried asking, but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All Sarah could do was roll on the floor laughing. These are the moments that make our friendship so special. We have so many memories of laughing until our sides hurt, and I'm so grateful to have her as my best friend. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and sharing it with someone you love makes it even sweeter."
623	21501	8	3	"Laughter ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" - unknown. This quote has a lot of meaning to a lot of people. I am one of those people that believes that this quote has a ton of truth and meaning. The best true story that I could tell you that involves me and laughter is about my dad and I. When I was little and still living with my dad, my mom fought with my dad all the time, and neither one of them was ever happy. My dad and mom both had good jobs, but they never had money to do anything because my mom loved spending money and got them both into debt. My dad had to sell stuff of his all the time to help pay off all the debt. My parents got divorced, which was a good thing for us all. I got to hang out with my dad, and I found out how much fun he is and how funny he can be. My dad and I started going hunting and all sorts of outdoor activities like that. I found that my mom is even worse when she is happy because she gets very hyper and loud, or you could just say annoying. She gets me to laugh every once in a while, but it's always at her rather than with her. I love being with my dad because I always have fun and learn something that will be very helpful to me. For example, when we go hunting, he teaches me about tracking animals, using the right equipment, and respecting nature. I think that laughter is important to have in any kind of friendship. If you pay attention to how you are around the people you like the most, you will see that most of what you do is make each other laugh. Laughter creates a bond, a connection that makes relationships stronger. It helps us get through tough times and enjoy the good ones even more. So, always make time to laugh with the people you love, because it's those moments that you'll cherish forever."
624	21502	8	3	"A Hopeful Letter A Desperate Wait. I felt simply hopeless. I was very stoical; my life was at its nadir. Helplessly, I had written a letter to my hero; no reply. I was determined to wait and see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lightning - fast, astounding; his name is Michael. I understand his music. My best friend Lily and I would always talk about how awesome his music is. In fact, our friendship started because of Michael's music. We were two different people; I didn't even think we could be friends or have anything in common. Michael's music brought us together. One day, Lily and I wrote a letter to the record label; I thought to myself ""Michael is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched Lily write the letter. Weeks and weeks past by, and I really thought the record label wasn't going to read or reply. After that, our friendship started to deteriorate. I felt discouraged; we only talked about Michael and Lily's photography project. We were really procrastinating toward Lily's project. I had been a little distracted with cheer - leading and homework from the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring Lily's calls and texts. Until I realized I had made a wrong choice. Then I called my friend Lily—thank god I did. A week later, Lily and I, along with two of my friends: Amy, my best friend since seventh grade; and Beth, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie, we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On our way there, Lily and I were telling Amy and Lily about our amazing experience in health. Our health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. Lily and I, facetiously, made an alien - looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes, and our alien had warts all over. We laughed non - stop. Obviously, we didn't turn it in. When we arrived at the dorms, Lily presented me to his friend J.J; J.J was a big fan of Michael. ""Hi there."" We played various games, and I noticed J.J had some warts on his hands. And when he took off his shoes to put on his sandals, I couldn't help but notice he somewhat reminded me of our drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non - stop. My friend kept asking me why I was laughing. I said ""J.J looks like my alien."" He said ""wow, that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes, that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh and kept playing games and listening to Michael's music. The next day, Lily and I had to meet to work on her photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each other and the things that we like and dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about Lily through this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life too fast, and I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything, but school and sports sometimes hold me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hang out with friends or simply rest. But I love my life and wouldn't trade it. My goal is to become an F.B.I agent. This project was intense. To me, it was a sign, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard when Lily's phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said ""Lily, answer the phone!"" Then she did. She said ""oh my god, it's Michael!"" I said ""stop messing around, now let's get back to work!"" She put her phone on speaker, and there it was; my hero on the phone! I was so happy that I started to cry. How could this be happening to us! I blacked - out. It was like I was in a daze. How could this ever happen to ""ordinary teens."" I could hear Lily talking to Michael, but my mind was in a whirl. I took a gasp of air and said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) He said ""hello, [Your Name], good luck in track."" And that's when I passed out. When I woke up, Lily and I couldn't believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, Lily said ""Michael, you talked to your 'husband.'"" We laughed for a long time. Lily and I have the best memories together. Our friendship started because of Michael's music, and it will never end. That day I realized: one, miracles happen; two, laugh heals the heart; and three, always have faith, never give up. Someone will always hear you and give you advice when everything feels like it's coming down on you. As Michael said ""come take my hand, we'll walk this road together."" And I'll always hold onto that hope and the power of laughter and friendship."
625	21503	8	3	On a hot July day during the middle of summer, I was having a blast camping in Maine. Sarah and her family took me along on their camping trip. We stayed in their RV, and our campsite was right by the ocean, so we would go on daily walks there. We stayed in Maine for a week. During that week, I believe on Tuesday, her older sister went into labor. She lives in New York, which is a pretty long drive from Maine. That morning, Sarah's mom and dad woke us up very early, around six thirty A.M. Sarah and I had stayed up late the night before until about three thirty in the morning, so we were pretty tired at that point. We found out that we were going to take a little plane from Bangor to Portland airport, and we got it fairly cheap because Sarah's brother works there. Since we knew we had a long day ahead of
626	21505	8	3	Laughter to me is the best medicine there is, and indeed plays a big role in any good relationship. It's especially good for a couple who's serious and has forgotten how to laugh. Also for those who could use their mood lifted. I know that laughter made my relationship so much better. In the beginning, my relationship with my boyfriend wasn't so great. We barely laughed with each other, let alone spoke very much. Only with friends would we laugh and have a good time. Though we weren't much of jokers anyway. All we could do was get upset or just not say anything. Even if the joke was funny. Well that all changed one night when we decided to go to the local arcade and play a few rounds of air hockey. When we got there we were kind of moody, and I was very short - tempered. After we sat down the mood lightened a little. Then we finally got to talking and then one little outburst sent us practically rolling on the ground. We were cracking up. Faces red and gasping for air. We laughed so hard we almost cried, and the jokes didn't stop. Our moods totally changed once that happened. We couldn't even remember why we were upset. Almost like the anger just vanished. Soon after we realized how ridiculous we were and that it's alright to joke around, just so long as it's not mean. Later on we went to a friend's house and had an awesome time. We told a few good jokes, laughed an awful lot, and really had fun. Then when it got dark we decided to go home and were still cracking jokes. I don't know what it was about that night but for the first time in a long time we were smiling and happy. Sharing that experience allowed us to really connect with each other. Not only that, but it strengthened our bond, and brought us closer. Our relationship has been great ever since then. We can laugh and have a good time, without being so serious all the time. I know now why laughter is very important in a relationship. Despite our little run - in with moodiness, all that joking around reminded me that laughter is by far the best medicine there is. It did some things that others never could. Some people may not think that laughing is best, but I believe it is. Those little giggles every now and then may not seem like much, but believe me there is so much more than you think. Laughter is everything to me. After what it did for me and my boyfriend, I don't know how I would live without it.
627	21506	8	3	"I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin Lily. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, it's magical. Magical as in how fast and easily it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry. One evening, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the horror movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in a spooky voice to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from the countryside. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the next week and they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then Lily says to me, ""Why don't we call him again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""What will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""We'll just say that we're his aunt from the countryside and that we're coming for a visit and all the rest we'll just make up."" ""Okay"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk. Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high - pitched picky aunt voice, ""Hello him, this is your aunt from the countryside and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear Lily laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was so into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half - way done. Even after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to hear my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about what a complete fool I sounded like. Lily kept shushing me each time I laughed too loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""Let's do it again because I didn't finish."" So we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it. When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, Lily said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the evening, and time to go. When we had finished our good - bye's and I love you's we hung up. That evening and every other time I laugh, I think what would it be like if no one could laugh. What a boring place this would be, what a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh."
628	21507	8	3	"To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether good or bad, laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship, simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed my mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the good things in life and begin to lose your patience with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and my boyfriend were on our way to a beach destination. It seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went to the beach for a vacation away from our hectic home lives and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had over - booked our hotel, our car broke down, my credit card account was being held for 24 hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk until when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together for a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and had had more than enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an ATM and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a ""good vacation"" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call my bank and see what was going on with my account. It turned out I forgot I changed my pin number to access my account. The entire time I kept entering the wrong pin so they locked my account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When I arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing my stuff and when he caught on to what I was doing he asked where I was going. I replied ""to luxury"". Instantly his face lit up and he asked ""how"" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as I saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car, and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness."
629	21508	8	3	"Laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world. It is something we possess with us throughout our lifetime. As humans, we grow old and eventually die, but laughter never does. It lives on forever. Laughter is often referred to as 'the best medicine', and why shouldn't it be? It brings joy to the sad, relief to the burdened, and life to the depressed. The best part about laughing is that it is completely and unchangeably free! Never will someone have to pay to gain a drop of laughter. On the other hand, laughter is also contagious. A single smile, throw - back of a head, and a gut - busting laugh can cause an entire room to become ill to this glorified epidemic. Laughter is the best release. When I was younger I had a neighbor named Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentering shop. He never talked to the rest of us on our street nor did we attempt to strike up a conversation with him. Day in and day out I would notice his little red pick - up leave in the morning and return at night. His life seemed like more of a routine and I was curious to find out why. Mr. Thompson had a wife who, as well, became a mystery to the rest of us. This was completely fine, because to us, she was a monster. Countless times soccer balls would be kicked into her yard by pure accident and she would come out of her quiet house yelling and waving her hands in our direction. She even left a note on my family's front door telling them to ""take better care of your lawn"". I sympathized with Mr. Thompson for having to live with the woman. Something in her voice seemed off, as if she was deaf. That aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her. Being different could have been a possible explanation to why she treated people the way that she did. I will never forget the day the ambulance pulled up in front of their perfectly serene house. I sat on my front porch silently watching the medics go inside the house. Not long after, I heard the little red pick - up coming up the road. I knew, as far as everyone else on Elm Street, that this was not part of the routine. After about 15 minutes, a body was carried out on a stretcher. My heart sank. Even though I was young, I knew the significance of a hovering white sheet over a being. Mr. Thompson was very secluded after his wife passed away. Nobody could blame him for that. He lost the love of his life; he lost his routine. My family discussed and decided to bring him meals. The food was never anything particularly fancy, just something that would keep him going. I've never seen anyone so appreciative. Still, we knew to stay off of his lawn. His wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow. He was lonely and my family wanted to be there for him. Soon after we brought over meals, my younger sister and I started walking his small, white, fluffy dog and invited him over for dinner as often as our mom would let us. He became more like a grandfather than a neighbor. One day, my friends and I were outside playing soccer on our small street. It was sunny and warm outside. Life was good. I could feel the vivacity of youth pulsing through my veins as I ran around. As if on its own, the ball rolled into Mr. Thompson's yard. We all hesitated when we saw his door open. He looked pestered and quite upset as he slowly bent down to pick up our ball. I winced, knowing I'd hear about this later from my parents. Then the unexpected happened, Mr. Thompson started laughing. The kind of laugh where a person might be considered crazy for being that happy. The kind of laugh where tears run down a person's face. Not knowing what to do, my friends and I started giggling to ourselves. Mr. Thompson threw us the ball and went back inside. His laugh was a clear signal, Mr. Thompson's grieving and unhappy soul had been relieved. From then on, laughter has meant a great deal to me. Laughing can direct you straight to a person's soul. It can be the connection between people. Without laughter, life can"
630	21509	8	3	So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him becuase I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to comeing over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one a other. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1 boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river fellowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horriable feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the he dmped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was think why are you just texting you should comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everthing better!
631	21510	8	3	"The thought of seeing him and hearing his warm, infectious laugh never failed to make me smile. I was beginning to accept the fact that this was an urge I couldn't fight anymore. His sharp sense of humor was the best I had encountered, and it made my heart race and flutter wildly. To me, the best part of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little quirks and idiosyncrasies that make that person who they are. A trait I always search for in someone is their humor, and when I can easily find it, I thrive on it. My story takes place nearly a year ago, while my freshman school year was coming to an end. I had a suitcase full of new memories I planned to carry with me, but one more was still to be added. I strolled into art class merely @NUM1 seconds late on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint hung heavy in the air, something I had grown accustomed to. Instinct told me to take my seat, so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus. A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me. ""@CAPS1 to go! You're late."" @CAPS2 the teacher had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but to laugh at myself as well. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a bright smile as class began. The teacher went on about art - related topics that I was far beyond, so by habit I vaguely paid any attention. I was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me. I had never talked to this boy but there was something very captivating about him. We barely said a few words on that day of class. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place. It had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned into the room, took his seat. @CAPS2 what I had forgotten made me excited. Today was a free work day, a time to be social and work at our own pace. It was the perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art. I casually introduced myself, trying to infuse personality into my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. Him being uninterested made me strive to try harder. I began to be myself and act as if I had known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then I had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing smoothly. By the end of that day I hadn't finished any of the work I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an alluring new person. Each day went on similarly but I had taught myself a good balance of work and talk. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in deeper. I'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny I found him because of how often my hearty laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and each hysterical thing he said. After a couple weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he made the decision to give me a call. I intrigued him as well. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations. More time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often. I no longer needed to act as if I had known him for years. It was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me. Although, along with familiarity came a sense of question. I was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return. I would tell him something of my past and he would make a light - hearted joke of it; I would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days, but it was coming time to feel more than just pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to tell him personal things, but get something from him too. I began to realize I was digging deep into shallow waters. The amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything more than simple, surface - level things. I still wished to have him be a part of my life, to still enjoy his company, but I had no need to dig deeper. It was time for me to find new waters to swim in."
632	21511	8	3	One stormy night, I had gone to the wood shed to get some wood. The strong wind was thrashing the trees violently, and all of the coyotes in the distance were barking loudly at the moon. I was taking one piece of wood at a time, carefully trying to make sure that the pile would not fall on me. As I watched my step, I lost my footing on a small cylindrical log about a foot long and hit my head hard. My brother came out to find out what was taking me so long and arrived to find my body unconscious on the ground. He quickly took me into the shop which is connected to the woodshed, getting me out of the cold. Then he turned on the furnace to keep me warm. In doing so, he accidentally locked the door from the outside, which locked him and me in the shop. As I woke up from my faint sleep with a splitting headache, all I could remember happening was the heavy rain pounding against the side of the woodshed. @CAPS2 was sitting next to me with a sad and shocked look on his face. He told me what had happened with the door getting locked and how we would never get out till morning. I looked around the dimly - lit shop, trying to find something to get the door off, but I couldn't figure out what anything was in the poor light. My parents could not hear us over the raging storm since they were asleep, and we were helpless no matter what we tried. So instead of looking on the gloomy side, we decided to make up some stories and tell jokes to pass the time till it was morning again. As we made up a game called @CAPS1, we found that we had a lot of similar interests and also we laughed heartily at the same jokes. As we laughed, the time seemed to fly by as if we were in a time warp. After three hours, it seemed that we were both getting hungry, and I had a couple of snacks in my pockets. So we sat by the warm furnace and ate, telling jokes about our friends and our parents. The continuous laughing kept us cheered up for another three hours. After a while, we started to hear the storm start to leave the sky gradually, like a ghost leaving this world to the next life. We started making fun of different movies and their actors and actresses. I started talking about how big @PERSON1's ears were, and we both started cracking up with uncontrollable laughter. He then came back to me with how big @ORGANIZATION1's lips were, and I laughed so hard I could hardly breathe. We looked through the small holes in the shop to see the morning dew glistening on the grass and birds chirping merrily in the trees, and I knew it wouldn't be long before we were found. As we waited for our parents to come find us, we looked at each other and said thank you. We both knew by saying that it wasn't meant for all the times I tried to get us out of the shop or for @CAPS2 pulling me into the shop. No, it was for the wonderful time we spent together and laughed. It made us closer than we already were and it also gave us a precious memory of laughter that we spent together instead of a night of disaster and horror. We have cherished that memory ever since it happened. Even though we @MONTH1 fight over the most tiny, inconsiderate things sometimes and make fun of each other, we know that deep down we do it out of love.
633	21512	8	3	@PERSON1 The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 out with buddies are some of the best @CAPS2 of my life, whether it's an exciting adventure or just a laid - back @CAPS1 time @CAPS3 out. I went sturgeon fishing for the first time in my life with my buddy @PERSON2. I haven't known him very long because I just moved to a new school, so I just met him and thought he was a pretty cool guy. He invited me to go fishing with him, so I decided to give it a shot. We woke up after only sleeping two hours the night before because we were up all night messing around, having a really @CAPS1 time. The alarm went off at @TIME2, and we were dead tired. We got the boat ready quickly and we were on our way to the @LOCATION1 river. We got there and unloaded the boat into the river. It was by far the coldest I had ever been, and I wasn't sure if I was going to have fun because I was wet, cold, and tired. Finally, the sun came out, and it started warming up. We were out on the water by @TIME1 and had the fishing poles ready. We drove the boat to the spot where we were going to fish. Everyone was saying we were dumb for going to that spot because it was no @CAPS1, but my friend's dad was one of the best fishermen I have ever met, so I just went with the flow. They taught me a few useful pointers, and before I knew it, we were catching fish and having a really @CAPS1 'ol time. By about the middle of the day, it was lunch time, but no one really wanted to eat because we were catching so many fish. So we waited a while and finally started lunch, talking animatedly about all the fish we had caught and all the fun we had had. As the day went on and the sun got lower and lower, along with the temperature, we caught a bunch more fish. It was about time to get off the water, so we all limited out and went back to the dock to load the boat back on the trailer and head back home. On the way home, all we could talk about was fishing that day and how much fun it was and how many fish we had caught.
634	21513	8	3	"Laughter is like a powerful drug that works better than any other painkiller or anti - depressant out there. It has the amazing ability to make angry people happy and happy people ecstatic. One of the best and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy, I say ""@CAPS2 with @PERSON1"". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years old; I was in second grade, and it was towards the end of the school year. I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have a great time. It was an ordinary, boring day @CAPS7 school, and I remember walking home slowly, hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3. I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching, but he just ignored me. So I went to my room to do my homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother. I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time. He let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes, we were already @CAPS1 uncontrollably. It wasn't just giggling or slightly chuckling; tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother ""@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" By the end of the movie, my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie. Every @NUM2 seconds, we'd quote it; it was non - stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next, wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched. And sure enough, after the commercial break, we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy. My brother was rolling on the floor, @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching intently, waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half - way through the movie, my mom got home from work. She walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics. She said ""@CAPS10's so funny?"" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough, our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family. @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14"", completely ridiculous and completely hilarious. @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time. We inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed, I remember staying up late, reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds"
635	21514	8	3	"I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS1 your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it."
636	21515	8	3	"Well since you guys want to hear a funny story, I got a couple but I'm only going to tell you about one of them. This one starts in my @DATE1, a particularly sweltering summer. I was living out in @LOCATION1, a small town known for its scorching summers, and it gets pretty hot in the @DATE1. I lived there a couple summers, so I know how hot it gets. This @DATE1 I wanted to get a pool for the fun and to stay cool. But I didn't want a pool that just I could hangout in. I wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone, a place where we could all escape the heat together. I already knew that those kind costed a bunch of money but, I wanted to get a big pool so I could have all my friends come over, hangout, swim and play my favorite game mar-co polo. I went to go talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said ""that he would love to get a pool for the @DATE1"" cause he would come in and swim with me and hangout but, like I was saying, big pools are expensive and that's exactly what my dad said. I told him that I would pay for half of what ever it costed. My dad finally agreed with me, so we go down to walmart and look at there pools. There was some cheap small ones and there was a lot of huge expensive ones but, I was looking for one right in the middle, not to small, and not to much money. I found one for eight hundred that was perfect for what I wanted. I went to go asked my dad if I could get this one. He said ""that if I pay for four hundred of it like the original deal that i could get it"". Like I told him, that's what I said I was going to do and that's what i needed to do. We finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first, so I went back to my house in @LOCATION1 to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job so its not that hard for him cause he gets paid. It's a lot harder on me cause I have no job. So I decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. I went door to door to find people that needed any help around there house. I found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and they both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, so out of each I could get a hundred right off the bat. I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done I put that money in my pool savings for later. I also went to this place called @ORGANIZATION1 and I was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. I talked to him about him asking them if I could do any work for a little cash. They said that ""I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and they agreed to give me eighty five bucks. I took there deal but, my bike can't go threw the mud where the trees were planted. My friend said that ""I could barrow his little fifty dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees"". So I borrowed it and got that eighty five bucks. I gave my friend ten cause he let me borrow his dirt bike. I'm almost half way to my four hundred. When I was thinking, I got so caught up in buying this pool that I forgot my birthday was coming up tomorrow. I told my dad that I wanted that pool for my birthday and he was like ""yeah I already knew that, so I already bought it"". I was so happy that I got my pool. Now I have like two hundred bucks to spend and I didn't know what to buy. So I bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party. On my birthday I invited a bunch of friends over to my house. We all got in the pool even the parents. We decided to play mar-co polo. Cause I wanted to play. My friend @PERSON1@NUM6 dad who is a huge dude was playing. I said mar-co and he lunged at me. I moved but he kept going, he went straight threw my pools wall and everyone fell out of the pool. I was laughing so hard but I was also upset cause my pool is already broken. Luckily @PERSON1@NUM6 dad is rich, so he bought me another pool. He seen how crushed I was on my birthday and because he knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike and it was sick. During the @DATE1 I had a blast in my pool and if I wasn't in my pool, I was on my new bike."
637	21516	8	3	"@CAPS4 - @CAPS1 Laughter @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 I cannot imagine where my life would be right now without laughter, who my friends would be, or how I would get through my day. Laughter is what created what has been one of the most important relationships in my life thus far. Laughter is what unifies us, it gives each of us something in common despite our differences. This has been proven true in my life, especially with one person, @CAPS4. I met @CAPS4 a year ago in a class of mine, we never really talked much or knew each other until that one day when she made me laugh. It was just another day in class doing a lab when I see this short ginger - haired girl twitching on a bar stool. I of course immediately begin to laugh. This girl was twitching around on a stool making awkward hand gestures and laughing, making me crack up, and not a single other person finds this funny, they are just giving us the ""you girls are insane"" stare. Others inquire what she is doing, @CAPS4 too hysterical to form actual words, I say ""hello dudes she is a dinosaur like from @CAPS7 the @CAPS8, 'I have a big head and little arms.... I don't think this plan was thought out very well....'"" @CAPS4 responds with a point to me and a head shake, I knew this was the beginning of a beautiful, laughter - filled, @CAPS3. There are countless times where laughter has been the centerpiece of my time with @CAPS4. When we are hanging out it seems that we effortlessly humor not only ourselves but others, even the complete stranger. The best example I can give is when we were at @ORGANIZATION1, a hotel with an indoor water park, for my birthday with two of our best friends. Our time there had already been full of laughs, pictures and a good time, but when we were all dressed up looking for something to do was the highlight of the @TIME1. Two nights of no sleep, loads of sugar, and energy drinks made our little foursome more insane than usual, giving @CAPS4 the courage to saunter up to a very attractive complete stranger and get him to say hello to the birthday girl, me. @CAPS4 and I start to bust a move and proceed to fall to the ground in laughter. At this point most people would think these four girls are strange and I am leaving now, but this guy was entertained by our laughter and even he joined in on the laughter. Perhaps the best memory of @CAPS4's contagious laughter was when we went to see @CAPS1 to @CAPS14 your @CAPS15. Believe me when I say this night could have easily gone downhill very quickly. Basically @CAPS4 was yelling at the movie, cracking jokes, texting, making us laugh, so all the things that get you kicked out of a movie and make the people around you angry. But for some reason the people around us ate up her humor and found it hilarious, they were laughing along with us. It was one of the best nights at the movies I have ever had, I have never been on such an adventure. The way laughter has impacted my life is by giving me this amazing best friend who is crazy and humorous. @CAPS4 is one of those people who makes you realize that laughter is what unifies us and is something to cherish. So go ahead, act like a fool even if you're shy, you never know who you might make laugh and what friends you could make."
638	21517	8	3	"My sister @PERSON3 and my niece @PERSON2 had just came down from @LOCATION2. It had been three years since I last seen them. When my brother @PERSON1, my sister @CAPS1, and I went over to my dad's for the weekend we all decided we would go camping over by the beach. That morning we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while us girls got ready. After everything was packed we were off to @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a small little town surrounded by mountains with absolutely nothing but a couple of houses, a park, a river, and forests all around you. My dad built a small one - roomed cabin there a few summers back. It had a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds fulfilling almost half the cabin, and a counter that was always messy with all the food and supplies that we would bring. The whole ride over we were all messing with each other giving one another horse bits, the claw, and pulling on other peoples seat belts so that it would tighten across their chest. We were also telling @PERSON3 funny stories about one another trying to embarrass them. When we got on the gravel road my dad started making the car slide back and forth, scaring @CAPS1. While everyone else was laughing about it she was screaming. That @TIME1 we all decided to go to bed early so we could wake up and get ready to go to the beach before noon. @CAPS1 was the only one actually wanting to go to sleep. Everyone but @CAPS1 was trying to make fun out of the rest of the @TIME1. While everyone else was having fun, @CAPS1 was yelling at them to go to sleep and be quiet. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 started yelling random stuff just to make her mad. When everything was silent one of them would yell something like, ""it's not too late to sleep like a baby @CAPS5 @CAPS6."" @CAPS1 would start yelling while everyone else just busted up laughing. That @TIME1 was one of the funnest nights there. Everything was hilarious that @TIME1 but when look at it now it wasn't all that funny it was just stupid. I believe we made the most fun out of the @TIME1 as we possibly could. It has become one of my most vivid memories. We all look back at it and laugh, and those memories will always bring a smile to our faces."
639	21518	8	3	Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means they're happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling too happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to make them laugh. Laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today. We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance, now when we want to laugh we need only to pick up a remote and turn on the TV, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to see stand - up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand. From the very first time someone laughed, comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that whenever my parents would have a new friend over, the only thing I would hear when they were at my house was the sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon the new guest was over much more often. Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more. If you have ever noticed, men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have heard but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic. Sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not feeling so good, so it might possibly be therapeutic for me. If this is so, then people have been going through therapy for many years just by laughing. Sometimes people laugh even when the subject is not funny; they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might feel kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh. Some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them. My mother has a very loud and high - pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh. No matter what your laugh is like, it can help you feel better and it can also help you become closer to someone. Laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh, to enjoy the simple joy that it brings.
640	21519	8	3	Library @CAPS1 @CAPS2 past @DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing, I decided to get a volunteer job at the library. Some might say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON1 and I it was full of numerous and humorous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were too loud and weren't too nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job? @CAPS3 @CAPS4, by definition it means he is someone who likes to @
641	21521	8	3	It was the middle of @DATE1 and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten, I still loved playing with my colorful toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on exciting vacations, either surfing the big waves in @LOCATION1 or roasting delicious marshmallows over the roaring fire with their loving families at camp. Meanwhile, I was stuck at home with absolutely nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE1 break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister. They had developed crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents, but it also meant that her brother @PERSON1 and I would have to tag along. I remember the first day being extremely uncomfortable and stiff. I could clearly tell he didn't like me. He only gave a little chuckle when I would crack a joke here and there. As time went on, though, I must have gradually grown on him because a few days later, he was laughing heartily at practically every joke I made. Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his warm - hearted family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because the reason I hadn't was a good enough one. We spent half the night chatting, laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other, we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1 and his family moved to @LOCATION2, where they were from. After they moved, I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1, telling me that they were going to move back. I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid, my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about another solid @NUM1 years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes. Looking back, I cherish the memories we shared, and I know our friendship, though miles apart, will always hold a special place in my heart.
642	21522	8	3	"Laughter can be a good thing and sometimes it could be a sad thing. When me and my family went to @LOCATION3, we went for my two little brothers' important appointment. We left a little early so we could have some well - deserved vacation time. When we arrived at our destination, we got onto a ferry to go to an island up in @LOCATION1. On our way there, my sister @PERSON1 was acting like she was on the Titanic. She had the beautiful dress and everything. My brothers, dad, and I just couldn't stop laughing at her because she is eighteen. While we stayed down there, we were at our uncle's house and they have a cute little dog. She was running from it and she fell so hard. My family and I weren't trying to laugh at her, but it's kinda hard not to. After we went to lunch with our uncle and aunt, we went to their military base. @PERSON1 would not keep her hands off of the jets. What my family and I thought was so funny is that @PERSON1 is eighteen and the rest of us are fourteen or younger, so I guess we just like to pick on @LOCATION2. When we went to @LOCATION3, it was the night before the boy's appointment and our family and us went to the underground tour of @LOCATION3. Well, after that was all done, we went to the gift shop that comes up at the end of the tour. Well, @PERSON1 buys a pin that said something not so good. After she bought it, our @CAPS4 had seen it and she threw it away because she doesn't like things like that, but @PERSON1 pulled it out of the trash. After that, all of us got hungry so we went to this place where they sell some really @CAPS1 tacos. We got an order and we sat down. Well, we also got some sodas. My other sister and I took a bite of our food and took a drink of our soda. @PERSON1 says ""oh my gosh there are two really hot guys right there"". @PERSON1 takes the biggest gulp of tapatio and I don't remember what @PERSON1 said, but she said something and it made me and Sierra bust up laughing and we spit our food all over @LOCATION2. She gets up and screams. So, of course, our parents and family don't want to be there anymore because we embarrassed them. So we all started to walk up to the car. And right when our uncle @PERSON3 yelled @PERSON1 don't fall because this is where I fell, all you hear is our sister falling behind us. It was so funny. What made it even more funny was that me and Sierra just started to stop laughing and oh my goodness, we were laughing the whole way to the car. Our whole way home, @PERSON1 was mad at us because we were still laughing at her, but when we went to the beach, she was over it. I think when we went to the beach, that was the place where we started to bond a lot more because we were all playing, no cell phones, lots of picture - taking, and rock - climbing. That was fun. We left @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS2 behind a couple of times. @PERSON2 tried to keep throwing me into the water, so I pushed him back. @PERSON2 threw a rock at @LOCATION2 and she fell over. When we were all taking a picture on a @CAPS1 log, we were all shaking it and @PERSON1, Sierra, and I all fell off and I hurt my arm, so we had to go to the doctors. A month after we got home, our @CAPS4 took @PERSON1, Sierra, aunt @PERSON4, and me to @CAPS3 on ice, and that was probably the best time of my life. Our @CAPS4 says ""I don't know what's funnier, @PERSON1 waving to the actors on the ice that can't see her in the dark or the show."" Our aunt said ""yeah, thank you @CAPS6 for making me sit next to her."" When the cartoon toys story came on, Sierra and I said ""look @PERSON1 what are you doing on the ice arena"" and she thought that we were talking about the pig and we were all laughing at the little troll. @CAPS4 and aunt @PERSON4 just busted up laughing. It was hilarious. When we went home, we were all talking about it and laughing. She got mad because we're always making fun of her because she is short, but when it comes to us, she thinks it's so funny. There is a lot of laughter in our family and I can't wait to have more in it so that when I grow up, I'll have a lot of good memories beside me and I'll still look back like I am now and I'll say wow, what good times I have had since I grew up. When our family laughs together, I think that is the time when we actually communicate and strengthen our bonds."
643	21525	8	3	"I have a friend and her name is @PERSON1. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth birthday party, she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dad's house in @LOCATION1. The plan was to hang out, have fun, and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a nice pool to swim in, a big flatscreen television to watch movies on, plenty of interesting board games to go around, and quite a few friendly people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE1, we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dad's apartment in @LOCATION1. A short @NUM1 minutes later, we had arrived at the apartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second that the van had stopped, all five of the people that were in the car, including me, unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten their seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2. She had thought she heard and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on, she attempted to jump up out of her seat. But at the last second, the seatbelt caught her by the waist and jerked her back down to her spot. She had laid there with her arms to her sides, with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day. A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chilling out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON1 had suggested ""@CAPS1 guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan."" The rest of us were all for it considering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny and clear, and because it was @CAPS2 @PERSON1's birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation, we all got our swimsuits on, grabbed our soft towels, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could hear was screaming and yelling. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! @CAPS4 feet are on fire!"" @PERSON2 remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot, @PERSON2 started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later, @PERSON2 had finally reached the grass and all we heard was ""@CAPS6!"" All of us looked up at @LOCATION2. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didn't know, so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON2 get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON2. These funny moments made that day an unforgettable one filled with endless laughter and joy."
644	21526	8	3	"@CAPS1 @DATE1"" My brother graduated @CAPS1 year. It was a great time in our lives. We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules anymore. This made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1, my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing else to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass. After he graduated, everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother, however, couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. When she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing, she had an idea. She would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to hear her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at. I myself thought this was a very cool plan and I was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planning on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us, which was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so happy when we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us. Immediately, @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready"

My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.

646	21530	8	3	"Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it, whether it's a hearty belly - laugh at a hilarious comedy show or a soft chuckle at a witty remark. There's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment. In general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Otherwise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people is difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, ""make them laugh"". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team than I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger than me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice this month gets, you can never become too exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Imagine life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane. Laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a wildfire in mid - summer, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch. Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness."
647	21531	8	3	"@LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the summer vacation. The rolling green hills, which seem to stretch as far as the eye can see, stunning sunsets that paint the sky in vivid oranges and purples, and thrilling thunderstorms that shake the ground with their might are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my mother's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my @LOCATION3 family has always been my Aunt Betty; with her friendly smile that can light up a room, caring personality that makes everyone around her feel loved, and a sharp sense of humor that can turn any dull moment into a fun one, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see Aunt Betty three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every summer vacation, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the winter break. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics. A few summers ago, Aunt Betty, my mother, and I traveled up to @LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either my mother or Aunt Betty must have for their already old - fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one - hour trip back to @LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins. Once my mother and Aunt Betty had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white Ford pick - up, my Aunt Betty pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving my mother and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. Aunt Betty placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick - up dipped down and thumped onto the road. Aunt Betty nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while my mother panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the tooth fairy didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that Aunt Betty had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor Aunt Betty had a red - rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the Grand Canyon. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea - blue eyes along with my mother and I. Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time Aunt Betty had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. My mother was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. Aunt Betty was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics. After the next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As Aunt Betty pulled out cautiously, I burst out, ""Try not to run over anymore curbs!"" This drew up another round of laughter. Aunt Betty has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, this bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e - mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My Aunt Betty is the most caring, humorous, and loving person I have ever encountered, and I unfortunately don't get to spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond would not be as close as it is, and we would both be clueless to our current world of joy."
648	21532	8	3	"Sunny days are diamonds and cloudy days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of Paul Simon. He was absolutely right and the day of June 15th, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, rushing to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh - period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding painfully. Of course, this had to be the day that Jake decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. Mrs. Thompson, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of Jake. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my 8 - year - old sister, Lily, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""What?"" Lily asked tentatively. ""What did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""You're a cat - astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stony day into a perfect little diamond."
649	21533	8	3	My dad and I went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning, of course, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel as I navigated through the familiar streets of our town. I drove all over town completing some errands we had to do along the way, such as picking up groceries and dropping off a package. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a car wash with me in control. I didn't think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but I was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start, I had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before I could do all that, the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car, I rushed to fold the side view mirror and was successful. Unfortunately, due to my slow reaction times, I could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and I were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasn't the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window and looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally processed what happened, we broke out in laughter. We had not stopped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All I could say after that was that people go their whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me! This unexpected event, though a bit of a hassle at first, ended up being a funny memory that my dad and I would surely laugh about for years to come.
650	21535	8	3	You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time last year when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think it's so funny that you laugh so hard you cry, your eyes watering and your stomach aching from the force of it. I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out, laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh, you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days. Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of a relationship with but yet you have to make do and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someone's upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh, it's so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and it's easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking
651	21536	8	3	"Have you ever had a truly memorable time, where you laughed so hard with friends or family that your sides ached and your eyes watered? Well, I know I have had several of those wonderful times with my friends and family. I absolutely love those moments when you laugh so hard that your stomach starts aching really badly. First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments was spent with my mom, whom I don't see often. So, this moment meant a great deal to me, as you can well imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and me, we decided to go bowling. She also brought her friend along with her. My brother and I hadn't bowled in a very long time, but we were confident that we would still beat them. However, it turns out my mom beat me. We had a lot of great laughs over that. Actually, I think that was the first time I wasn't a sore loser. Although, I'm still not quite sure how she beat me. She would throw the ball down the lane sideways, and somehow it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it's truly inspirational. All in all, we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom. Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in a while, my dad, brother, and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. These talks can be about my mom, school, our animals, or all three of our passion for sports. These conversations always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don't get to spend much time together because my brother and I are always at school or involved in some kind of sport, and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me. Sometimes they are sad, and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason, he thinks he has to add another ""l"" in front of the ""b"" so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that, but we all have our moments when we like to laugh at each other. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about. Sometimes, laughter is a very important part of someone's life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh can make all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and accepted. It's also a great way to put people back on track when they're down. I know smiles and laughing make me feel so much better inside. I hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about."
652	21537	8	3	In the summer of '19, I spent two relaxing weeks at my aunt's house. At the time, my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close, so we always liked to spend quality time together. One evening, we decided to watch a movie. I clearly remember it was called My Best Friend's Girl. So, we started to watch the movie, and it was super funny. We laughed constantly throughout it. My cousin named Jake has an awesome, contagious laugh. Every time he started to laugh, I couldn't help but laugh too. After we watched the movie, we went to go get some delicious food. We were all in a very good mood, making hilarious jokes and doing crazy things to make each other laugh or be funny. My cousins would change their voices, making them higher or lower, repeating lines from the movie or just making up silly things. That night, we ate at McDonald's. When we got back to my aunt's house, none of us were tired, so we decided to watch a late - night program called Cartoon Network. It was a program composed of a bunch of short, wacky cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them, laugh out loud, and mimic what the characters did. We stopped watching it at about 2 in the morning. I was very tired, but my cousins were not. For awhile, we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid, funny things that would make us laugh. About an hour later, we all fell asleep. We continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that summer. I was very happy and enjoyed my summer because of my two cousins and the wonderful time we spent together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and shared laughter has brought us closer and more involved in each other's lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have a good time, and is fun to be around.
653	21539	8	3	"Live as long as you breathe, love as long as you live. His death was impossible; there was absolutely no way his death could be real. Breathing seemed virtually unachievable, as if I was choking on thin air. Everything around me blurred, spinning viciously as I clung desperately to the fresh - cut grass. Tears diluted the burn in my eyes, but not the sharp sting in my nose. Though neither caused my body to tremble as his death did. Attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone and helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to do. My best friend stood and watched as I grew more violent, pounding the dew - soaked lawn with my fists. Whimpers transformed into ear - piercing shrieks. A door slammed behind me and I felt the strong arms of my father, trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest, more in an attempt to silence my obnoxious wailing rather than comfort me. He apologized repeatedly. I imagine he didn't know what else to do. His death was too early for the ""In a better place"" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as I stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, my sister trailing close behind. Sitting on my bed, it seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I was missing something, like he was closer than I knew. I sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. The image of him and his ""stunna - shades"" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof, flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief and frustration. He didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face he'd say, ""Come on, suck it up and take it like a man!"" I knew in my heart he wanted me to be with the people he loved and he wanted us to be smiling. With the morning sun beating on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Reaching her front porch, I realized immediately the time I was about to spend in that house would be like none before. When I let myself in as I always did, she peered around the corner, eyes swollen and discolored. I took four steps forward and met her with a tearful embrace, in which I apprehended she wished I was him. She loved him in a way I'd never fathomed, but the desperate longing to be held by a loved one, I knew all too well. We cried and held each other because there was nothing more we could do. When there was a pause in the sobs and she actually looked at me for the first time, noticing I looked just as terrible as she did. I reached into my pocket and pulled out his sunglasses. His death made it hard not to be selfish at a time when all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to do. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew it was my next step. Her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands. ""Thank you."" She started weeping once more. I held her and tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, tear - stained and reddened as well. I smiled at them gently. They all took notice of the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand. They hadn't known him the way she and I did. We spent the day gathered around, at a loss for words and hungry. Our pizza sat untouched, the television on just to break the heavy silence. No one said much, about anything. ""Do you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?"" I felt the question rise up like vomit, too large to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I feared I spoke too soon. I began to assume all of the melancholy and crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted for longer than it had. She smiled and nodded to my relief. ""And you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles."" I laughed aloud; I couldn't help it. I was flooded by the memory of him trying to act confused as to why the boiling water had cashews floating on top. ""Do you remember how he'd always braid your hair?"" She smiled even greater. The rest of that month was filled to the brim with tears, but it overflowed with laughter. When he died, laughing was the last thing I wanted to do. He always generated the larger portion of my laughter, and with him gone I never imagined I would live fully again. But in reality, just because he left too soon doesn't mean the laughter did. My happiness in his memory will never die."
654	21540	8	3	"Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at when looking back on it, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something really silly to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who have a knack for bringing the laughter out in me, I know my sadness won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggles here and there. Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts at getting fit, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course, this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start working out that very day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first, my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after just five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working hard at it and not even slowing down, kept me going. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something fun to do together. The happy gym days were short - lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way. My car was a 5 - speed, and I only knew how to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator were about halfway. At first, I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her hearty laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang ""Johnny Cash"" in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more hysterical laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""Friends"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning 300 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost 5 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self - motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the hard work. Because I had been"
655	21541	8	3	"Laughter and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Laughter is the key component in anything in life. @CAPS2 is able to turn any sad moment good and any great moment even greater. Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, @PERSON1, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a ""little bird"" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called @CAPS2 our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked @CAPS5 for @CAPS2. I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if @CAPS2 weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @CAPS2 @CAPS3 change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. @CAPS2 is one of the most important tools a person @CAPS3 have."
656	21542	8	3	"Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""universal language of connection"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In [specific date], laughter was a big key in the success of our annual family reunion. Our family reunion consists of around [number] people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it might not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my grandpa decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes. My grandpa is somewhat of a master of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the family reunion. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well - rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""Oh my goodness"" and ""Help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a family reunion member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part. In [specific date], laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best language of connection out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!"
657	21544	8	3	I choose to have a positive outlook on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an every - day factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl without it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new church. I didn't know anyone there and I was really nervous about going to [specific date] [specific time]. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was Ms. Johnson. She was pretty and very tall with a funny Australian accent. She was wearing alligator - skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. Johnson introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. After taking my seat we recited Bible verses and read short clips of religious stories. When church had ended mom came downstairs to get me. Reluctant as I was to see her I took hold of her hand, said bye to Ms. Johnson, and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which I recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later mom took me downstairs to church. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was Lily. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for church so I could spend time with Lily. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one another's houses. In fact Lily has her own toothbrush at my house and I have one at her house as well. One time Lily and I were in church, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! Lily and I have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever. Laughter has truly been the glue that has held our friendship together, and I'm grateful for every moment of it.
658	21545	8	3	Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self. In my opinion, laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things. Laughing also makes you feel close to people because once you and that person get to know each other you'll just laugh about anything even if it's not that funny. For example, when I first meet people I am very shy. I don't really say much but if the person that I am talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them, it makes the conversation fun. If there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be around a person with no sense of humor. In my opinion, everyone has a funny side, some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves. Some people might be funnier but the thing is we can all be funny in our own way. I've had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people. Me and my friend met in middle school. I was good friends with his sister but I never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of classes with him so I started talking to him, but because I already knew him I wasn't very shy. The first day that I talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not in a mean way. He was joking around how I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him any, it was more of like an inside joke. The thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around. So I immediately felt like I could be myself around my new friend and not worry about what he would think. Now we are best of friends. We laugh about everything and we have our own little inside jokes. When I am talking to my friend I can say anything that I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and it's because we just laugh all the time when we are together. When either of us is going through a rough time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and we naturally have a bond, laughter just makes our sisterly bond ten times better. We have very similar personalities, and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us. There is always something we laugh about. Laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship. Without laughter it would be a miserable, unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases, it brings out truth in people. When you first meet people, laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends, for example, like my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or mad, it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh. It just makes everything better. It really can change some people's mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life, as it enriches our relationships and makes life more enjoyable.
659	21546	8	3	"When I was about thirteen me and my older brother decided we were going to spend the day fishing. I got out of bed that morning, threw on a pair of old torn - up blue jeans and went downstairs to get some breakfast. On my way I could smell the sweet aroma of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water. My brother was up and about and had just finished his plate. My mom handed me my plate and I reached for the bottle of ketchup. Ethan was sitting across from me as I ate and said, ""We'll leave in an hour or so"". I said okay and went on eating. After breakfast we gathered our poles and tackle boxes and put them in the car along with an old boat we kind of ""borrowed"" from the old neighbor lady. We put our stuff in the van and mom drove us into town. It was about eight in the morning so we wouldn't get back home till about three or four in the afternoon depending on how the fishing is. There was a little store in town and the creek went right behind it. It was a small creek. I grew up on it so I thought I knew what to expect. We put in behind the store and our mom left after telling us to be safe. It was a chilly [specific date] morning and a little cloudy. The water was cold and my brother said I should wear his waders. I thought it was silly seeing as we would be in a boat. But I put them on and we put the boat in the water. This was the first time we ever even used the boat so it was exciting. As we went down stream the water got fast and loud and the embankment was like a wall to the outside world. As we took the next corner there it was. A waterfall about as tall as a man. Not the kind you would see in the movies but it was good enough for our eyes. Right in the middle of it was a big rock and water went around both sides of it. We were pushed right up against the rock and were almost thrown from the boat and we grabbed the rock for dear life. We were stuck and I looked at my brother and he nodded as if to say down is the only way. So with that being said we both let go and let the water have us. As soon as we let go it was like being on the back of a two - thousand - pound animal in a rodeo that only lasts a second. When the boat sunk my waders filled up instantly and it took all I had just to hold on to that boat that was pulling us down stream now. We lost all of our gear except the tackle boxes, an oar and that stupid boat. It took all we had but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water out of it and the water out of me. I was scared for my life now. This was supposed to be a fun fishing trip but it was now a game of survival. We couldn't turn back now. The only way to get home was to go the rest of the way. I was cold and wet and didn't have any options. We had to continue so we tried it again just to sink. We spent most of that day carrying the boat around rapids and through brush all day until it mellowed down and we could put the boat back in. We got to a big pool, so big you could fit a house in it. There were some small rapids running right through the middle of it. It didn't look bad but with what we had been in we decided to be extra careful. We went around the rapids through the pool. As we went we barely grazed the end of the rapids with the boat and we went in. I tried to keep from sinking but my waders were too heavy. As I tried to swim to shore my shoe fell off and went down stream. Being stupid I chased after it on my belly to get it. The water was faster than I thought as I let it carry me. I was swallowing so much water and I couldn't breathe. I could feel it begin to get deeper and soon I couldn't touch bottom at all. My shoe was right in front of me and I finally got to it with barely anything left. I got to shore and just lay there choking up water. After ten minutes I got up and went back. I think it was freak luck we survived that day but somehow we did. Looking back, that terrifying fishing trip taught me the importance of resilience and the unpredictability of life."
660	21547	8	3	It is true that laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life. Sometimes laughter gets you out of trouble, sometimes it gets you into trouble. But the more we laugh the more we are going to be happy. A time that laughing came in handy was in elementary school. In the fifth grade, the school population was split into a group. The popular girls, band nerds, hippies, and the jocks. The lunch room was always how you knew who was who. The popular girls would sit with the jocks. Every one of the girls had a boy to flirt with. The band nerds on the floor making straw recorders and drums out of milk cartons. The hippies all in a circle eating salad out of one tray. None of these groups ever interacted with each other. I fell into the group of the hippies. We wore green everyday and peace signs on as many pieces of clothing as we were able to get on our tiny little bodies. We were the nicest group. We helped with every school - friendly activity there was to do. We did recycling
661	21548	8	3	"Laughter, one of the truly wonderful things that we humans can whole - heartedly enjoy. We can share laughter with friends, close - knit family members, and even with people we do not even know well. We all have the ability to enjoy and share laughter, and it is one of those amazing things that can bring us together regardless of our ethnicity, age, gender, or any disability. We all can relish it together, and no one can ever take it away from us. Laughter is simple on the surface, but yet complex in numerous ways. It is like falling into a pool of pure, unadulterated joy. Just the word ""laughter"" brings an immediate sense of joy to me! When our days turn sour, laughter is there to sweeten them up. Where would we be without the wonders of laughter? Laughter is like a precious tool. It is the thing that has helped me forge new friendships. Also, laughter has assisted me in getting out of conflicts with both friends and those who were once my enemies. It has also played a part in aiding me to achieve the things I desire. Laughter was a constant in my middle school years. My family and I moved frequently, and every time I moved, I had to step into the daunting task of making new friends. It became extremely difficult for me to make new friends each time I transferred to a new school. After I had settled down and gotten accustomed to the surroundings of the new school, I then began to make friends. I noticed that laughter was a key element in making people like you, and later on, they would consider you to be what is known as a friend. After I had made new friends and become very comfortable in my school, the time to move came knocking again. It is tough to make new friends, but it's even more heart - wrenching when you have to leave the new friends you just made behind. After moving so often, I just got used to the cycle of making new friends, and later on, laughter slowly transformed from something to enjoy into more of a tool. A tool solely for making friends. After I got into high school, I just stopped trying to make new friends because I felt that I knew the drill - make new friends, transfer to another school, and start all over again. I gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and strive for good grades. Later in the year, I felt like a lost kid with no friends because I had stopped trying. I decided to go and make new friends, but somehow it became a lot more challenging to make friends in high school than in middle school. I tried to be the funny guy like I was in middle school, but I just didn't have that spark in me anymore. Also, as people grow older, the type of humor people enjoy undergoes a change. As time went by, I realized that you don't have to make everyone laugh to be their friend. It was about getting to know the person, being able to relate to them, and being there when they needed you the most. Making friends at a new school is not an insurmountable task, but it also isn't a walk in the park. All you have to do is be open to people and let them know who you truly are. This is what I learned about making friends. You can't make everyone laugh because everyone has a distinct taste in humor. Humor and laughter are different from each other. Everyone has a different preference for humor, but we can all come together and have a hearty laugh. Laughter is truly wonderful. It is what puts people in a sunny mood. We as people, despite our differences, can still all laugh together. It feels incredibly good when you get a good laugh, but it's even more rewarding when you know that the person who made you laugh did it to bring you happiness. We should not take laughter for granted for it is something that can put a genuine smile on our faces."
662	21549	8	3	In the story I am going to tell you, it involves one of my close friends and myself. After school one day, my friend and I went to my house for the night. It was an absolute blast. We started off by playing video games, and we would laugh really hard whenever one of us would die in the game. The excitement and the shared laughter filled the room. Then, after a while of intense gaming, it was dinner time. My mom told us to get off the games and come eat. Dinner was really fun. We would secretly throw small pieces of food at each other when my parents weren't looking. It was a riot until dinner was over, and we didn't have anything left to throw at each other. But then it was time to start playing games again. By this time, it was about ten o'clock, and we were getting really tired. So we put in the movie Step Brothers and settled down to watch it. It was the best part of our day. We were laughing non - stop at every single joke and action in the movie. It was truly great. We both loved it and really wanted to watch it again the next morning. But before we could, my friend's dad was there to pick him up. So that was the end of the best time with my friend and the funniest time ever. It was amazing; we laughed non - stop the whole night. Now that just shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, bringing us closer and creating memories that will last a lifetime.
663	21550	8	3	"Have you ever had that one special friend who was your absolute best friend, someone you could go to for anything under the sun, someone you were so close to that you guys knew everything about each other, from the way their nose flared when they laughed to their deepest, darkest secrets? Well, [PERSON2] was that type of best friend to me. Us two crazy monkeys became friends way back in first grade. We were never the type of girls to sit quietly in class and read a book or stay calm throughout school. No, we were the adventurous girls who played sports with the boys, got dirty, and came back with scratches. We were always laughing, playing, and having a whale of a time. Laughter was a huge part of our friendship because, well, we were almost always laughing. We would get in trouble for keeping our parents up late at night with our crazy jokes, our loud, uncontrollable laughter, and the hyper - psychotic ninja adventures we would embark on during the middle of the night. No matter what we were doing, we could always find a way to make a joke out of it. ""You guys are perfect together,"" said my mom one day, and all I had to say in reply to that was ""I know, we are two monkey ninjas."" [PERSON2] and I had this one particular restaurant that we adored going to. It was [PERSON1] [PERSON1]. Usually, [PERSON2]'s dad would take us there at least twice a month, and we would always order the exact same thing every single time. [PERSON2] and I had this unique ability to find humor in things that no one else understood. We would sit there in the booth with her dad and talk about the funny times, the stupid fights we had, and end up laughing uncontrollably throughout the time we were at [ORGANIZATION1]. It was a warm [DATE1] [TIME1]. [PERSON2] had come over to my house and was planning on spending the night. We had our whole night meticulously planned out. We were going to call her dad and use our creativity to talk him into taking us to [PERSON1], and when we got back home, we were going to go for a jog, then get ready to go on an ""adventure,"" as we liked to call them. So we called her dad and had cleverly talked him into taking us. But the catch was that we had to go over to [LOCATION1]'s house, mow the yard, plant some plants, weed some of the garden, and then he would take us. So we went, of course, and did all the work that we had agreed on doing. Then we went to [ORGANIZATION1], dirty, sweaty, and completely exhausted. By this time, everyone at [ORGANIZATION1] knew our names like the back of their hands. We made jokes with them and sometimes even got the special privilege of going into the back room to get our ranch if there weren't too many people there. We ate our food, got extra fries and extra ranch, and sat there with full bellies. We were all set to leave, but her dad had to go to the bathroom. So [PERSON2] and I sat there and waited while he was in the restroom. He was taking a longer time than he usually did, which was fine with us because we wanted to talk about this one boy that [PERSON2] was having a ""thing"" with, and we couldn't talk about it while her dad was around. Finally, he came out of the bathroom, and I noticed that his zipper was down. But he was so close that I didn't want to say anything to [PERSON2] about it until we were further away from him. And him being in his playful, hyper mood wouldn't let us get far enough away from him so I could tell her. As we were walking out of the door, I finally told [PERSON2] to tell her dad that his zipper was down. So as she turned and looked, she burst out into laughter because while his zipper was down, he was talking to a group of people who worked there. So as we were both laughing hysterically, we were trying to tell him. We finally got him to start walking out of the door, and at that time, [PERSON2] said between giggles, ""Dad, your zipper is down."" He looked down and let out his nervous/oh - my - goodness laugh and zipped it up. The whole ride home, [PERSON2] and I were laughing as hard as we could. Our stomachs were about to burst from all the laughter. Her dad was in the front seat, occasionally giggling because he couldn't believe that his zipper was down the whole time. And as we were nearing my house, he said, ""There was a song playing, and I wanted to hurry and write the lyrics before they were over. I really liked that song."" That to me, was the funniest thing her dad ever said. Her dad went home and bought the song on iTunes, and also learned to check his zipper more often. [PERSON2] is the perfect best friend for me. We are so alike in many ways, but our sense of humor is the most similar aspect of our friendship."
664	21552	8	3	Laughter is truly the best medicine, especially for a friend in pain. My friend [CAPS1] and I were inseparable best friends, and he would come to my house every weekend. After school one day, while I was waiting for him, I decided to go for a bike ride. I rode around the block a couple of times, and then, out of nowhere, I hit a curb and crashed hard. The handlebar of my bike hit me right in the lower rib cage. My mom quickly took me to the doctors' office to see if I had broken a rib. The doctor examined me and said that I had only bruised it. On the way home, I was in excruciating pain. My mom made a stop to buy me some ice cream, thinking it would help, but it didn't make a difference. When we got home, I just lay on the couch, trying to find a comfortable position. I heard a knock on the door, and it was [CAPS1]. The first thing he did was ask what had happened. I told him that I didn't want to talk about it right then. We had dinner together and then played a board game. After that, we watched some movies, and eventually, we both fell asleep. We woke up to the delicious smell of bacon. I was still a bit groggy, and by the time I fully realized that I had woken up, [CAPS1] had already gone downstairs. I was in so much pain that I couldn't even get up. So I just lay there for a short while. [CAPS1] came back up the stairs to see why I hadn't joined him. When he saw me just lying there, we just started to laugh. I noticed that I felt a little better, but I didn't think much of it at that moment. After we ate breakfast, we turned on the TV. My mom said that everyone else had to clean, but [CAPS1] and I could play because I was hurt and [CAPS1] was our guest. We played Mortal Kombat [NUM2], with [CAPS6] and [PERSON1], and [CAPS7] and [ORGANIZATION1] as our chosen characters. I won most of the rounds until he started to cheat a little, but it was still a lot of fun. When we were done playing, we watched a really funny movie. We laughed so much that I almost forgot about the pain in my rib cage. We then decided to go to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he took a shot, the ball bounced off the rim and hit him right in the face. I thought that was hilarious, but he didn't seem to find it as funny as I did. When we got bored at the park, we headed down to the market to get a snack. While we were eating, I told him what had happened with my bike. He asked if it had made a visible mark, so we looked, and it looked just like a smiley face. It was both funny and a bit creepy at the same time. When we got home, he said that he wanted to go for a bike ride. At first, I was a little scared because of my recent accident, but I decided to give it a try. We rode around my yard for a while. His mom arrived shortly after. Then I went inside and just sat there. My mom asked me how I felt, and to my surprise, the pain in my rib cage was completely gone. I had gotten better because laughter is indeed
665	21553	8	3	One rainy, @DATE1 day in a far away place their was a soccer game.that i was in.

666	21554	8	3	Have u ever been hit by a basketball in the face? One sunny day I was playing basketball with my close friends. I had no school that day, so I think it was like around 3 pm. We were having an absolute blast playing my favorite sport and cracking jokes non - stop. The day was going swimmingly; I was making hoops effortlessly and I had some really hilarious jokes that made everyone burst out laughing. My friend Tom asked me a question about some girl, so I turned my face to him. Then, out of nowhere, the basketball hit me right in the face hard. At first, I didn't get angry; it was an accident, so it was all good. But then my friends started laughing uncontrollably. That made their day, and they just couldn't stop. So I lost it; I wanted to hit all of them. I started to think that if one of them had gotten hit in the face the same way I did, I would've been laughing too. But they didn't seem to care. So I just left home angry. When I got home, I was still seething. So I went to the garage where I have a punching bag. I started hitting it to get my anger out, just like my dad told me when I was a little kid. He said when I'm angry, don't take it out on the family; go run or hit something, but don't take it out on the family. I was in there for like half an hour. Then I went inside to the kitchen to get something to eat. My mom was there, and when she saw my face, which was still red from the hit, she started screaming at me, asking what happened and if I was fighting. I was still angry, and then her screaming at me made me even more furious. I just couldn't take it anymore, so I left to my room, put some music on. I was in there for like an hour, and then my phone was ringing. It was my friends; I had like five missed calls and three messages from them saying if I was crying and things like that, still making jokes. The time went by, and I was still angry; I just couldn't forget about what had happened. My younger brother Jake came into my room with food. I was still hungry because I didn't get anything from the kitchen since my mom was screaming at me, so I left with no food and an empty stomach. He was eating it in front of me, making faces and saying that was the best sandwich ever. I just couldn't take it. I took it from him. He wanted it back, and then I sat down and started eating it. He came up to me and asked me why I was angry, and I told him. He started to laugh, and I gave him a light punch. He asked me if I wanted to go play video games. So we went to play Call of Duty, which is an army game. He's really good at it, and I suck. Every time he kills me, he starts saying jokes like “who's your daddy” and stuff like that. After a while, I forgot about what happened and began to smile. So me and my brother went outside the house to play soccer. We were there for like ten minutes, and then my friends were walking by. Mike screams my name, I turn my face to him again, and I got hit again. My brother kicked the ball hard; it was going really fast. When I saw it, I had already got hit by it, but this time it was in my stomach. Everyone laughed at first, I didn't at first, but then hearing everyone laugh and thinking about it - to get hit twice the same day and in the same way because I turned my face - I thought it was funny, so I started laughing too. My friends came over and said they were sorry for laughing at me, but it was funny. And the one who hit me said that it was my fault because I wasn't looking. I was like “whatever”. I asked them if they wanted to play soccer with us. They said yes. We were playing for like five minutes when my brother kicked the ball and hit my friend right in the face, the one who hit me with the basketball. I started cracking up and told him why wasn't he looking and that what goes around comes around. That put a big smile on my face, and after a while, it was all good again. We were having fun with no anger towards each other. That's one time laughter changed how I felt.
667	21555	8	3	The elements of laughter is to show emotion to others, to let them know that you had a great time or to show that they are special. Laughter is sometimes within me. I laugh heartily when I have a great time. The greatest laughter I always have is with friends when we're saying crazy things as we go to the bus after school. That's the joy shared between friends, a way to release the tension and stress from school. I always go home with a big smile on my face. There are always jokes to tell to bring about that joy. When the bell rings at the end of my last class, I'm tired from working hard throughout the day. When I go to my bus, which is located on the front of the school, I feel stressed out from the work I had to do. But I can't wait till my friends come to the bus. We always have a wonderful time chatting and joking around. I completely forget about school and just laugh along with the jokes and ridiculous stories we tell. When we get to the first stop, everyone gets out with joy, even me. This process has lasted for three years. But the next year is going to be our last ride on the bus, and 7, which is my favorite number, seems to mark this special transition. I hope we will still have the same great time even after this last bus - riding year.
668	21556	8	3	The new trimester had started, and leadership was my second - period class. With no idea of what the responsibilities of a leadership student were, I was skeptical about taking the class. After a few days of taking the class, I began to enjoy it more and more. After a week or so, the teacher announced that we would be on stage, helping set up and organize the upcoming assembly. I had never done anything of the sort before, so I was somewhat excited. Days went by, and the entire class practiced setting up the assembly. We ran to our places quickly, moved props carefully, and stacked chairs neatly. The day of the assembly finally arrived; it was time for the show. The students poured into their seats as we scurried around behind the curtains, making final adjustments. Everything was set up perfectly. The curtains rose, and the assembly began. My peers and I stood behind the stage, watching the assembly unfold. The school band performed a long, boring set of songs. The curtains fell, and the entire leadership class ran out on stage, picked up and stacked the chairs that the band just used. After that, we all ran to get the bleachers and dragged them out to the front of the stage. The choir was now going to perform, and we then retreated back behind the curtains. The choir sang their songs, and we watched. But as they proceeded to set up for their last song, students moved around, leaving a large open spot in the top row. With the choir's last song, they performed a simple swaying dance to go along with their song. My leadership - class friends and I noticed this large open spot in the choir and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance. However, none of us had enough courage to do it. The choir finished their song and dance, and the first assembly was over. We then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly. It was time for the second assembly, and everything was going to be performed again. The students came in, sat in their seats, the band played, we stacked chairs and moved bleachers. It was time for the choir to come out and sing once more. The thought of how funny it would be to go up on the bleachers and dance came upon us once again. Finally, we convinced one of our classmates to do it. She ran to the choir room, put on a choir robe, put her hair in a funny bun fixed on her forehead, and stepped up onto the bleachers. She took the open spot in the top row. The song began, as well as the dance. She broke into random dancing, not in any way matching up with the other dancing choir members. It was obvious she did not belong up there. The crowd soon began to realize what was going on. Laughter broke out in the seats, and soon after, laughter also erupted behind the stage. I was laughing like I had never laughed before. It was painful; tears were pouring down my face, and I was gasping for air. Running out of breath and bracing myself for a deep inhale, right at that moment, the song had a dead - silent pause. The auditorium went completely silent. I inhaled, and as I took in that air, my body managed to let out an extremely loud, embarrassing screeching noise. People behind the curtain stared at me. I knew that it was heard throughout the auditorium. Embarrassed, I laughed even harder, causing more pain, more tears, and a greater lack of oxygen. The song ended, followed by the end of the laughter, and then by the end of the assembly. We then cleaned up the stage. The girl stepped down from the bleachers, and we all scrambled out of the building, hiding the robe along the way. We laughed all the way to our next period, listening to the students in the hallway talking about it. Giggles filled the school for hours. Talk of who it was, what actually happened, and why it happened were on everyone's minds, except for ours. The second - period leadership students knew exactly what had happened. We had the pleasure of telling everyone in school about the dirty little details. The following days, however, the teachers also got word of it. Not thinking our actions all the way through, we would soon have to face the consequences. We were told it was irresponsible and child - like. We had a plethora of possible punishments, like in - school suspension, out - of - school suspension, a referral, an apology to the choir class, and loss of the privilege of being in leadership. After the school board talked to our parents and gave the event serious consideration, we got out of it with having one day of out - of - school suspension and apologizing to the entire choir class. The school board realized it was just a joke, letting us off easier than it could have been. In my eyes, the prank was well worth it. For weeks on end, every night I would go to bed laughing about that leadership assembly.
669	21557	8	3	Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears are spilling out of your eyes; your face turns bright red, and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter; this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, with tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I won't be so sad later on. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people. St. Mary's Elementary was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a rather moody fourth - grader. But my friends were much different. They did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down, we would sit on the Blue Bench. Very creative, I know. This bench was navy blue and sat right at the corner of the playground, right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives. One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the bench. We watched as the boys ran as fast as they could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the St. Mary's would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the St. Mary's studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the bench, a few boys walked up to us. “Hey, wanna play some football with us? We could use more people!” they said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with their persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the previous day's rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower than the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods and was much better at making us happy than the bench. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The bench was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun. But one day while we were playing, it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened; it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere, a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of
670	21558	8	3	"Many believe that laughter is the key to the start of a great friendship. @CAPS1 can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better. Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand @CAPS7 powerful. I especially didn't know until two years ago when I met @PERSON1. @CAPS1 only took the move of my former @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to understand laughter's full potential of the beginning of a great friendship @CAPS1 all started a couple weeks before school ended when the news was received. At the time i was part of a small @CAPS3 group, in a small church, in a small town. @CAPS3 @CAPS2, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 were moving, and would no longer be able to lead the @CAPS3 group. The entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news. But none were as depressed as the @CAPS3 that they had touched in their many years in ministry. We had grown used to the couple. Many of the few that had been around the longest , including myself, had spent nights at their house, or in my case babysat their young daughter. They were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go. But sometimes I wonder if they hadn't what would have happened. Many well wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they had departed. As a congregation everyone thought that no one could ever touch our hearts they way that they had. But that was just a thought. Two short months later, word had gotten around that someone from @LOCATION1 was traveling here to our small town in @LOCATION2 for an interview for the newly open position. All the teenagers were guarded the moment that he had walked through the door. His name was @PERSON1, only in his early twenties, but had quite a lot of experience in ministry. My first thought was that this must be some kind of joke! @CAPS7 could he lead a group of kids if he's only a kid himself!? I wasn't very keen of him. Neither was anybody else. But something was very different about him. He wasn't afraid to tell us about his life, @CAPS7 he had grown up, and seemed to be totally honest with everyone of our questions we asked. And that was when we knew as a @CAPS3 group that maybe he was the one.  Even though I knew @PERSON1 would be our new @CAPS3 @CAPS4 I still didn't want to accept @CAPS1. I tried and tried to avoid him although @CAPS1 always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to. So finally, @PERSON1 decided @CAPS1 was time that the two of us needed to get to know each other. One @DATE1 @TIME1 my mom got a call from someone at the church, she wouldn't tell me who, but that I needed to go. So I did. And who was there? @PERSON1, in the sanctuary just the two of us and the associate @CAPS4, because @CAPS1 would be too inappropriate for us to be by ourselves. "" your mom didn't tell you @CAPS6 your here, did she?""I laughed, "" @CAPS6 no she didn't"" "" @CAPS7 do you feel you and I talk? Go hang out, wherever you want?""""um....ok @CAPS7 do you feel about going to @ORGANIZATION1?"" The question was puzzling to him, @CAPS1 did to most, but he accepted the idea. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS6 are we going to @ORGANIZATION1?"" he said as he pulled into the parking lot."" I don't know @CAPS1 was just the first thing that popped into my head.""We both chuckled. I felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip.  As we walked through the building @CAPS1 started to be quite boring. But the boredom faded away as we decided to pass through the toy aisle, and set off all of the toy alarms and sirens. Toy after toy had started to go off as we went through the aisle touching every toy that made some kind of absurd noise that would drive anyone up the wall, which many did. Finally we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better. @CAPS1 surprised me that both of us liked a lot of the same things. He told me more of his childhood like @CAPS7 he was adopted and what @CAPS1 was like before hand and afterwards. @CAPS1 was wierd that only a short time ago I didn't want anything to do with @PERSON1 and now I was walking around @ORGANIZATION1 laughing and just having a good time. That was about three years or so ago. Shortly after @PERSON1 had to leave. Many rumors were told @CAPS6 because he didn't really tell anyone other than the fact that the council had asked him to leave. No matter the reason I still am in touch with him and am glad that the day at @ORGANIZATION1 had happended."
671	21559	8	3	"Though my sister and I have very different personalities, and much of the time do not find humor in the same things, we have still shared some truly humorous moments. It's those times when you decide to just go with the flow and enjoy someone's company instead of letting little things bug you. One sunny day in @LOCATION1, I somehow managed to convince my sister to go rollerblading with me. My dad drove us to a large park that had a huge, serene pond right in the middle of it. The pond was nice in the sense that there was a smooth, well - maintained sidewalk that circulated all the way around the pond for my sister and I to skate on. However, the pond was not so nice as it was very littered with ducks and geese, and of course, their droppings as well. We always thought of the pond's water as one of the most disgusting things on earth. We got our roller - blades on and carefully, shakily stood up. Our dad was going to take a nap in the car while we made our laps around the lake. As we skated, we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small, rickety boat. They were totally unaware that their boat was tipping strongly to one side. My sister and I thought it would be absolutely hilarious if all of a sudden the boat tipped over. We let that thought pass and continued on our route. On our next lap around, we heard a woman yelling. We looked up and saw that it was the woman who had been in the boat. The woman was now standing on the shore, angrily yelling at the man to get all her belongings that had fallen out of the boat and were now floating in the gross pond water. The man was waiting in the water up to his chest, clumsily collecting their items and trying to deal with his upside - down boat. ""That date was definitely unsuccessful"", I thought. We could hardly contain ourselves from bursting out with laughter. We roller - bladed back to the car as fast as we could. My sister was in front of me and when she tried to stop, she just couldn't. She basically body - slammed the car, fell back, and rolled right underneath it. My dad rapidly opened the door to find me crying with laughter. We pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home, still chuckling about the events of the day."
672	21560	8	3	"When I told my mom that I wanted to run from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to @LOCATION1, she let out a loud, sarcastic laugh. Her laugh was one of utter disbelief, as if she was saying, ""Is this a joke?"". Yet, when the crazy idea of running for @NUM1 hours straight was truly thought through, the laughter began to slowly melt away. The idea made perfect sense; I wanted to go to @LOCATION1 with my school's band, and the cost was roughly @MONEY1. My family didn't have that money, and I certainly wasn't going to go around bribing my neighbors penny by penny to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine. I needed to earn my money in a way that not only was meaningful but also efficient. What better way to do that than to do a long - distance run; a skill that I not only loved but was also quite good at? The plan started small; I would run from sunset to sunrise with some friends, aiming to raise about @MONEY2. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for @NUM1 hours would entitle me to over @NUM3 consecutive miles. So what if I was fifteen years old and had never even run a marathon before? Something deep inside me told me it was possible. And so we laid out the plan; I was to run about @NUM4 miles a week, with three - hour runs on @DATE3. I ran about ten miles a day, including tough hill repeats, running backwards to build different muscles, and doing many, many lunges. For some reason, both my coach and I were convinced that I could do it. Running was one thing, but then there was the reason behind the running; raising money. A family friend, @PERSON1, who was both a seasoned runner and an organization whiz, helped me out. When I informed him that my goal was to raise @MONEY2, he looked at me with a determined look and firmly said that I could do better. We started out with local businesses, asking for things ranging from bananas for energy to an energy gel called ""@CAPS1"". @PERSON1 taught me how to dress professionally, talk confidently, and present myself well to each business. He also helped me create an eye - catching flier to put up in coffee houses and a proper way to organize the money I brought in. Next, came the friends. Surprisingly, I found that a lot of my friends not only wanted to donate but also wanted to participate in the all - night run, and thus was created the running ""shifts"". Soon, I had about twenty people who were going to run with me, ten businesses that were sponsoring me, and four ""drivers"" who drove cars with mattresses for rest, food for energy, and water in the back to support me and my ""crew"". Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me and that crazy, laughable idea on. The night of the ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 All - Night Run"" came before I knew it. The day before, my stomach was twisted in knots, and it was almost impossible to rest. Yet, as people arrived ready to run, drive, and cheer the whole event on, my fears began to gradually subside. The weather was wonderful, with clear, star - filled skies and decently warm temperatures for early @DATE4, and everybody who came was cheerful and encouraging. As the sun set on that fateful day of @DATE1, a group of roughly twenty teenagers, all with a crazy goal and strong spirits, set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing that they would return when the sun rose the next day having conquered something almost impossible. As we ran, headlamps were turned on, music was cranked up to keep our spirits high, quirky runner games were played to pass the time, and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the briskly cool night. The hardest part for me was returning to my home after @NUM5 miles for a bathroom break around @TIME1 and realizing that I still had seven long hours left. As the miles and minutes began to blend together in the seemingly endless night, it became hard for me to believe that the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted so badly just to stop, rest, and sleep. That night, with our feet pounding the cold pavement, we ran like shadows through the endless night, our eyes eagerly searching for the sunrise that would signify our time to stop. The sunrise that rose the morning of @DATE2 at @NUM6 am was the most welcoming sight I had ever seen. @NUM7 miles behind me, and well over @NUM8 for each person in my group, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. Everyone who had been resting jumped out of the support cars and joined me for the last mile, every one of us watching with awe as light seeped into the darkness, stunning the quiet, frost - covered world with warm light. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted yet exuberant shout left the throats of everyone. It was then, in that gorgeous sunrise, that my mom and I hugged and laughed; a laugh that was not sarcastic but spoke of how a girl had done the impossible."
673	21561	8	3	"My best friend is probably my brother, @PERSON2. It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the old, wooden table in our mother's backyard. The air was a bit cool, and the gentle breeze made the leaves rustle. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, ""just done with all this."" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. His face was pale, and his eyes were filled with worry. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had just told @PERSON2 that if he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal. Added on top of that, he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time was simply too much for seventeen - year - old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to @PERSON2 for at least another half - hour after that about what I thought he should do. At the end of our heart - to - heart talk, I told @PERSON2 that, ""If you don't get it together and start getting good grades, they're going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, if that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; because the only person they're going to have to nag on is me."" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and then laughed until we cried. I don't know to this day what was so funny. Maybe it was how serious everything was when we were just kids, or maybe it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay. It made us think about how young we were, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That initial laughter made it possible for us to simply let go. After this happened, @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as if this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career. He chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who had @ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it laughter that helped @PERSON2 get through this difficult time? I couldn't say for sure, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @PERSON2 did what he needed to do, and our bond as siblings grew stronger."
674	21563	8	3	"The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she is getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, yet delightfully cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet. I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a sunny @DATE1, and for the past four days I had been bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never - ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. The heat was intense, but the adventure was thrilling. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander into a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2 - so - very - cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he had actually taken the time to carefully comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly, with a slight smile on his face. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks started to hurt from smiling. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of crispy fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small, creamy vanilla ice - cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He nervously fiddled with his pockets a little, while also casually brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his warm, genuine smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam - packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the strong connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2 - so - very - cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still"
675	21564	8	3	The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a fluorescent lamp shaded in the corner. Our blaring television screening an action packed, science fiction movie drowns out profane rap music escaping from my brothers headphones. Cuddled up on the couch my sister, @PERSON2, and I alternate braiding each others hair. Our small kittens @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON1 race to their food and water. As always @PERSON1 is superior and @ORGANIZATION2 scurries up the dining room chairs, defeated. Irritated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sighs heavily with frustration once @ORGANIZATION2 trips his laptop charger and rips it out of the socket. Keys jingle, the door slams, speedy footsteps: @CAPS3's home!   By now it is @NUM1 o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everybody seat checks after snatching some food. The aroma of spicy @CAPS4 food steams the entire apartment as everybody feasts on chalupas and gulps down @ORGANIZATION1 from @LOCATION1. Napkins are distributed and the cats linger around our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is portioned between the cats, which causes a bit of ruckus. @PERSON1 undertakes @ORGANIZATION2! The thief in @PERSON1's attitude begin to shine through as she robs @ORGANIZATION2's portion. This causes @ORGANIZATION2 to hiss at her, and proceed to hop onto the coffee table. On the way, she charges through the five drinks at the end of the table, managing to knock over two of them. Then the nacho cheese, being very unnoticeable, coats her striped gray paw leaving one-inch, yellow-orange circles to puzzle us. Minute but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of @PERSON2's chalupa. Raining down the coffee table are trails of blue fizzy @ORGANIZATION1, and puddles gather at my feet the new suede couch. Smothered by booming laughter, @PERSON2 screams at @ORGANIZATION2 for stealing her chalupa. Following the escape of @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1 trots innocently behind her. My sister is still steaming angrily so in attempt to calm her down, I take off my newly @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1-stained sock and catapult the mess toward her head. Instead of the sock slapping her in the face like I had hoped, it whistled past her ear and splashed in the fullness of my mothers stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family is cracking up! @CAPS1 @CAPS2 reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the chuckles die down and we prepare ourselves for the next humorous incident.  I am freezing and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just lounging around, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is frustrated from failure of employment, and @CAPS3 is weary and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us: laying our busy brains on a fluffy pillow and allowing slumber to take over our life for the next @NUM1 hours. Looking past our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with one another. Considering the fact that @PERSON1 is younger than @ORGANIZATION2, hilarious situations such as this, amuse my family daily. Surprisingly @ORGANIZATION2 wore the warrior suit this time which added a few extra minutes to the process of the hilarity. Not only that, by also the fact that it took a toll on everybody's dinner. My family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations. The main element in our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever. 
676	21566	8	3	"Learning to laugh @DATE1 as we were vacationing in @LOCATION2, I clearly realized that laughter is a truly big part of our lives, and it's an important factor that can firmly keep friends and families together. Not too long ago I also discovered that laughter can effectively relieve you from stress, and it even helps you lose weight in a natural way, which, I thought was pretty interesting. My sister on the other hand still did not quite believe that laughter could do all of that. She thought it was just being blown out of proportion. She firmly believed that if her friends didn't want to hang around with her, then there was something wrong with them, that if we didn't have enough food in the house, it was probably my parents' fault. There was always someone to blame for whatever happened to her, there was always a bad side to everything. But that @DATE1 it was going to be different she was about to find out that she didn't have to live her life that way, because there is always an alternative. The trip to @LOCATION2 was something everyone was eagerly expecting, even me. I was actually really excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family. Everybody carefully packed their things, we got ready to leave, got on the car and left to the airport. My aunt @CAPS1 was already patiently waiting for us at the @LOCATION2 city airport. Everything was going great. So far... When we got there, my aunt drove all of us to our little town in the state of @LOCATION1, just about an hour and a half away from the airport. As we were getting there I noticed my sister had a strange look on her face, she seemed somehow confused, lost in her own thoughts as if she was worried about something. ""@CAPS2's wrong with you, are you okay? you look all weird..."" I said sounding a little sarcastic and hoping to start a conversation. ""@CAPS3 face is all weird!"" she said and that was the @DATE1 thing she said to me until we reached our destination. As we got to our grandparents' house we begun to see all our family members already waiting for us outside. The joy of seeing them there was truly incredible. I looked around around and I saw my sister, I was glad that she looked happy, I thought she was actually enjoying the moment. I did not know @CAPS2 was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard. During my time there I met new family members, saw some old familiar faces and remembered some good and also bad memories, memories which I thought had vanished from my mind already. Turns out they were still there, all the way at the back of my head where I had tried to hide them so that they would never come up again, but somehow they managed to get out and make their way into my thoughts again, and that is when I started to feel like a monster once again. Suddenly I had a flash back to the time when we came to visit, a couple of years ago. That's when it all came to me I saw the whole scene once again I felt horrible. There she was, my little sister @PERSON1 playing in the swings, suddenly she let go of the swing and she fell right into a mud puddle that was there. Everybody laughed, I laughed. I thought it was funny, but she didn't laugh, she didn't cry either, she just got up and ran inside. I never stopped to ask her if she was okay, I didn't realize how my actions had affected her. It was all my fault, I knew she was really sensitive when it came down to some specific situations, but I did not help her, I didn't give her the comfort and support she needed from her big sister, so she never learned to laugh at herself and keep going. That would have been a nice advice to give her instead of laughing at her. Then, after a couple of minutes of reflection about it, I went up to her and apologized, she looked a little confused at first, but then she realized where I was going. This made the rest of the trip a lot more easier, now that I knew @CAPS2 was wrong, we both tried our best to fix the problem and work on her self - esteem. Laughter was the perfect therapy for her. All she needed to do was to learn how to laugh about herself when things did not go the way she wanted them. It was hard but we accomplished our goal. My sister discovered the power of laughter, and she learned to get back up from her mistakes. Life taught both of us an important lesson that @DATE1. I'm sure that was one of the most exciting trips we've ever taken and the memories from that trip will stay with us forever, reminding us of the importance of laughter and forgiveness."
677	21567	8	3	"Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the ""nervous laugh"" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual, like a sudden burst of noise in a quiet room. The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub. Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair - weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so I could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it. We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided @CAPS1 sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with @PERSON1, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more. @PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing too hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside. Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again. Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling that can lighten up even the coldest of days."
678	21568	8	3	"It all began one morning when I heard my hulking mass of an alarm - clock spouting off again. So I reached over and pushed the button to turn the exceedingly loud contraption off. When I noticed that I have woken up ten minutes late, and so I jumped out of the bed and sprinted to the shower. When I was finished, I got dressed in my @CAPS1 - shirt and jeans, which is what I normally wear, then unplugged my cell phone from the charger and placed it in my pocket. Having dealt with the situation at hand, I went down the stairs and into the kitchen to prepare the modest meal of oatmeal. After I was finished eating, I packed up my books and walked back up the stairs to brush my teeth. After doing so, I swiped my coat and hat in one fell swoop. I secured them to my person, grabbed my back - pack, and walked out the door. I stood there on that cold and rainy morning, pondering what the day would hold for me. Suddenly, there was a great noise, I turned to face the approaching threat only to find that the bus had arrived. My mind quickly recovered from @CAPS2 slightly startled state and I stepped onto the bus. The bus ride was no different from the others, kids squawking about what happened at school yesterday, what they are doing @CAPS2 @DATE1, and other seemingly useless conversation. There I sat my eyes fixed gazing out the window of the bus, watching, studying, and mapping the present course of the massive vehicle. We stopped at one of the bus stops, and on the bus came my good friend @PERSON1. As usual she came and sat down next to me and we started talking about the usual cars, music, and the occasional jokes. As I started to develop a creative and captivating joke, she just belted one out right off the top of her head. We both just started busting up laughing, I even felt a tear form in the corner of my eye. We didn'@CAPS1 stop laughing until we got to the school, and my joke was successfully forgotten. The joke lingered in my head all day long, to @CAPS2 day I still think it is one of the best I've ever heard. Through all of the countless jokes, underhanded comments, and puns I've heard, that one brought about the most laughter of all. But then @PERSON1 moved away to another city, @CAPS2 was a sad day. The very next day I heard the age - old saying, ""@CAPS2 one time at band camp....."", story and laughter was restored to my life. I learned something that day that friends may move away but the jokes that were said will still remain, always ready to bring a smile back to our faces."
679	21569	8	3	It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so I picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that I can't remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good - size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night. Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a man - like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all - around hairy body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man. Back to what I was talking about earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave they see two full - body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air. Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that I have ever laughed in my life. To this day I look back at it and laugh just as hard as I did the first time I saw the movie. About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends' houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying
680	21570	8	3	Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome.
681	21571	8	3	In @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there are so many elements in a person's life that hold great importance. Many people strive to make friends, achieve success, but most importantly, they aim to find happiness. Everyone desires happiness in their life, right? The purest form of happiness stems from your heart. It is widely believed that laughter originates from the heart and has the power to make you and those around you genuinely happy. One crucial aspect of laughter being significant in a relationship is the optimism it brings to your partner and friends. This shows people that you aren't just a consistently pessimistic, rude, and unhappy individual. You can truly enjoy life and have a wonderful time. After all, no one wants to spend time with someone who is constantly negative and only focuses on the bad things. Your partner will grow tired of you, and you will lose friends. Being able to laugh and joke around with others makes life a whole lot easier. It might not seem like much, but it takes some stress off your shoulders when you have a good time and share a few giggles. Another reason why laughter is so vital in a relationship is the sound of your laugh. What if you get a boyfriend or girlfriend, and they've never heard your laugh before, and once they do, they think it's the most annoying thing in the world? Studies indicate that they would be more likely to leave you. On that note, if you do have a terribly annoying laugh and that's why you're reluctant to laugh, I'd suggest sticking with smiling because us girls have pretty cute smiles that can get us out of a lot. Lastly, there is one more main part of laughter being important in a relationship, and that is happiness. You need to laugh to be happy. Without laughter, what is a smile? Without laughter, how will happiness shine through? Life can become quite boring when all you do is act like a mime, with no smiling, no laughing, and no fun! When you laugh, it encourages others to laugh and have a great time. Plus, it's incredibly fun! Like when you laugh so hard that you cry or when you really need to go to the bathroom, and it gets even worse when you start bursting into laughter. Laughing creates memories. And memories are a very important part of growing up. So now that you've learned these three elements as to why or how laughing is important in anyone's life, relationship, or friendship, go out and laugh. It will make you feel a whole lot better.
682	21573	8	3	"Hello my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS11. I am going to walk you through one of the most hilarious experiences I have ever had. It is a story about me, my friends, and a little adventure we had on @DATE1, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days I had ever seen. I mean, it was amazing, with blue skies, warm @DATE1 air, and the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me and my three friends, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2, were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual. And then we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat and thought about what we could do, nothing came to mind. Until @PERSON1 suggested that we go to the beach and meet up with his cousin. ""@CAPS3 has a nice house right on the beach, and probably wouldn't care if we stopped by,"" @CAPS3 said. The three of us looked at each other, then looked at @PERSON1, and said, ""let's go!"" We packed our boards, guitars, and food, and we headed out. On the way, we decided to go to the @CAPS4 city skate park. None of us had ever been there. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated and about to give up on finding the park, we decided to take one more @DATE1 loop, and then @CAPS10 what happened. ""@CAPS5 it is,"" yelled @CAPS2. ""@CAPS5's the park, I found it."" We looked off in the distance, and @CAPS5 it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. We pulled in and parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring, and the park was soaked. We headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that @PERSON3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily, @CAPS3 had @CAPS7, so @CAPS3 called them and had them come and unlock the car. It took them an hour and a half to find us and unlock the car. Now we were all mad and wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. After leaving the park, we decided it would just be best if we went to @PERSON1's cousin's house and stayed there for the @TIME1. When we got there, we were greeted with open arms and warm clothes. ""Looks like you guys have had a rough one,"" @CAPS3 said. ""I'm @PERSON2. I'm sure @PERSON1 has told you all about me by now."" After we changed into the clothes @PERSON2 had given us, we went and sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat there and talked for what felt like forever. Then I said, ""I wish we could have a big fire on the beach."" ""We can,"" @PERSON2 said. ""I know the perfect place."" @CAPS3 took us to a small bay on the beach about @NUM1 yards away from his house. @CAPS3 called it driftwood bay. ""@CAPS10, told you I had the perfect spot."" And it was perfect, secluded, sandy, and with all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire and kept throwing wood on it until it was over @NUM2 feet tall. For the rest of the day and on through the @TIME1, we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, and telling the story of our day. Laughing and noticing that even though the beginning of our day wasn't very fun, we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the @TIME1, and sharing a good laugh with your friends."
683	21574	8	3	"Laughter means a great deal in a relationship in @CAPS4 opinion. Laughter can convey several things. It can signify that you are having a good time and enjoying life. All of @CAPS4 friendships and relationships are filled with laughter. Half of the time we laugh, and the other half we express ourselves. Laughter could also mark the beginning or ending of a relationship. A lot of people assume that laughter is always a joyful reaction, but sometimes a person could be laughing because they are nervous. But I think what we are discussing here is the joyful kind. All of @CAPS4 friendships contain laughter, but they also include moments when someone needs to be listened to or heard. One of @CAPS4 friendships that is rich in laughter is with @CAPS4 friend @PERSON3. Ever since the day that I first met her, we've laughed a great deal. Usually, it's @PERSON3 being the joker, and I'm the audience, along with a few other people. But, there are also moments that don't involve laughing. Moments when @PERSON3 can be a wonderful listener. Making jokes and giggling can demonstrate how close you are to someone. Like @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2 and I. She's one of @CAPS4 closest friends. We share almost everything with each other. We tell each other what's going on in our families and all that good stuff. But there are so many moments that are simply filled with laughing, giggling, and making up jokes about @CAPS5 knows what. Whether it's twisted in some strange way or even when it doesn't make sense, we still laugh about it. It doesn't matter how stupid I might act around her; we always laugh it off and make fun of each other, not in a bad way. Usually, when people fall down, they feel embarrassed or scared of what everyone else would say. There was a time that I was sitting on @CAPS4 friend, @PERSON4's skateboard, just sitting and rolling up and down the sidewalk, when I came upon a bump. I'm pretty sure you can guess what happened next. I flew off the skateboard and landed on my butt on the cement. I sat there for a second and just stared, shocked that I had flown off of a skateboard while just sitting down. Pretty disappointing. But the next thing I knew, I was laughing, like it didn't even matter that I had just landed on my butt in front of one of my friends. @PERSON4 was laughing too. I didn't mind. @PERSON4 didn't even tease me about it. Laughing can shrug things off your shoulders, helping you turn it into a joke. That's what I did. @CAPS4 relationship with @CAPS4 @CAPS1 is full of jokes. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 is the type of guy who just loves to tell jokes and/or act like some historical figure to confuse people. When I answer the phone, half of the time @CAPS4 @CAPS1 tries to see if I'll fall for one of his little tricks. One time, he tried saying that he was @PERSON1 and that he invented all these different electrical items. I shook my head and was like, ""@CAPS1, you're not very good at acting."" Then he said, ""I'm not your @CAPS1. This is seriously @PERSON1."" I laughed and said, ""@PERSON1 is dead. How could he be talking to me over the phone when he's dead, @CAPS1? I know it's you."" @CAPS4 @CAPS1 laughed. ""@CAPS5 told you I was dead? Obviously, I'm still here, little lady."" I smiled. ""@CAPS6 huh. Sure. And I'm not a little lady."" ""@CAPS7 fine, I give up. You can't get a joke, can you?"" he said. I frowned. ""Of course I can. What are you talking about, @LOCATION1? It's just you're not very good at acting."" ""@CAPS7 sure, blame it on me,"" he laughed. ""Where's your mother?"" That's when the joke ended, of course, but @CAPS4 @CAPS1 and I actually have a strong relationship. He's @CAPS4 adopted @CAPS1, in case that hasn't been mentioned. So, when I first met him, we weren't as close as you could probably guess. But after a year, we got closer, and I learned that I could trust him. And that half of what he says is basically a joke. Sometimes, I wonder if he ever knows how to be serious so he doesn't confuse people, for example, me. For me, relationships should always have laughter; otherwise, it just makes it all serious. Making it very hard to stay close, in @CAPS4 opinion. And I, myself, like laughing and having close friends. Because when I'm feeling down, it's always nice to have someone there to make you smile and laugh. It's a great quality to be able to laugh and help people. Without laughter in the world, like I said before, the world would be too serious, way too serious. Who would want that? I wouldn't. That would be terrible. When people laugh, it makes the world a better place to live in, in @CAPS4 opinion. Laughing is a gift, a very special gift."
684	21575	8	3	To me, laughter is a way of someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter sometimes can be used in the wrong kind of way. For example, if someone were to get hurt in any kind of way, and the other person laughs at them when they've hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle, it not only makes me feel good but also the other person I was talking to. It shows both of us that we can be happy and that there is joy within us. I have a friend that I go to school with every day, and he always just looks so grumpy and upset. And when someone asks him what is wrong or if he is okay, it seems that he just gets more angry. So, me being one of his closer friends, I try and help him with that, and so far, it has been working. I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him in the hallway or even out of school, I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others, we have grown a bond, and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being in a better mood, it makes his whole day of school a lot more fun and enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. If I were to explain who I was, I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others, and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you, which usually leads to laughter. Laughter is a very important part of your daily life, and I think that it brings people closer, so use it and don't be afraid.
685	21577	8	3	Laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer, connecting them through something they have in common and forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them. Laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens. In fact, without laughter, I probably would not even get through my day-to-day school life. Without
686	21578	8	3	A couple years ago when I was in middle school, I met one of my best friends, with whom I've had great times. When I first met her was in math class, where she had an assigned seat right next to me. We started chatting, and even though we didn't know each other very well, I could say that laughter was the closest distance between us. We would just burst into laughter at really random things that happened because we didn't really know what else to talk about. Sometimes, it didn't make sense what we were laughing about. But we laughed anyway, even though we didn't always understand each other's jokes. Laughing was what kept our distance close.  Time went by, and we became good friends. Laughing was the one thing that kept us close together because, at that time, we had nothing better to do. We both are people who like to laugh a lot, and if not, we get bored easily. If either me or her had no sense of humor when we first met, I don't think we would have gotten along so well in the end. We didn't really have much to do because we didn't know each other very well. We would only hang out during lunch and in any other class we had together, but all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny, which was often really silly.  A couple of months later, we seemed to become really close friends, not just bonded by laughter. We got to know each other much better and finally had things to talk about. We also found out that we had something in common. Laughter still played a part in our friendship, but not as much as at the beginning when we first met. During math class, we were always talking and laughing at the things we said. That had never happened before. But now we were able to talk about other things too, not just things that made us laugh, and we knew that laughter isn't the only thing that keeps us close. Now we had other ways to get along as well.  I have friends with whom I get along in different ways. I have some friends with whom the relationship isn't extremely close, but we laugh a lot. With some of my other friends, I don't laugh that much, yet we have a very close friendship. My friends and I can get along in various ways, not just through laughter. We all have different ways to get along and have fun. Some of them are really calm, and some of them like to laugh a lot, just like me. Most of them are the type that like to be laughing all the time, and we are closer because of the way we are with each other.  I think that laughing can be the shortest distance between two people. There are other things that can keep two people close together. Laughing does help people have a good time together, but I don't think it's a huge, crucial part of a friendship. I believe it's about how they get along and if they have something in common. It also depends on how they treat each other. Everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend, so I think it's different for everyone.
687	21579	8	3	"One day when I was going to school with my friends, I accidentally stepped in dog poo. All of my friends burst into laughter, and it was so embarrassing. I was extremely mad because my brand - new shoes, which I got for my birthday, were now dirty. I had to go back home and clean them, and I knew I had to tell my mom that I got dog poo on my shoes. To my surprise, when I told my mom, she wasn't mad at me. I would have thought that she would be angry since she worked hard to get the money to pay for my shoes.  The next day at school, all my friends were still laughing at me. I just went to my class, sat down, and started my math work. When my best friend came up to me, she asked, ""Did you really step in dog poo?"" and then she gave me a piece of paper that had a drawing of a dog pooping on a girl. I got so mad that I started crying.  When I went home after school, my mom asked me how school was. I didn't want to tell her that my whole day was bad because everyone was laughing at me. So I just said that school was good. She then told me that all people are not good, and I realized that not everyone will be kind in difficult situations."
688	21581	8	3	"Laughter to me seems like the very foundation of a relationship; whether it is a relationship with your parents, best - friend, or your spouse, it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle. I have seen on social media that when a guy tries to ""pick up"" or ""hit on"" a girl, most of the time he will try to be funny to ""break the ice"". When that so - called ""ice"" is broken, the air is open for both people to start showing each other who they truly are.  My best friend and I have been friends for five years now, and I sincerely hope that we will be friends for many more years to come. @PERSON1 (my best friend/and only friend) has shown me how to be myself completely, with her and try to be the same with others. Together, @PERSON1 and I have had many hilarious adventures that I will cherish for the rest of my life.  Just recently, @PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. It was @PERSON1's second time going snowboarding, and I have been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay by her side and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet. I also promised that I would fall down with her when she fell.  When we got to the snowboarding area, I showed her how to clip her bindings on, what the stomp pad was used for, and also how to skate. Skating in snowboarding means that your front foot boot is in the binding and your left foot is free. You push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift. It took us a long three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope. Normally, it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down.  While teaching, laughing, and bonding with @PERSON1, I noticed that when I laugh with her, I get feelings of love, caring, and pure happiness. Laughing with her always brightens my day. In fact, that is how we became friends; it was by laughing together.  After we got off the slope, she said some words to me that I will never forget. ""@CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ever ask for. If you were a man, I would marry you and have your children. I love you."" Those words meant a great deal to me because @PERSON1 is the kind of person who usually keeps her feelings of love and caring inside. It was the first time she had ever said she loves me.  Laughing together for five years now has made @PERSON1 feel more open with me, enough to say something that she might not even tell her family. Laughing and even giggling together is what @PERSON1 and I look forward to in our relationship, and it will continue to strengthen our bond for years to come."
689	21582	8	3	"I am so good at making people laugh; that is just one of my very awesome qualities. I have lots of stories of when I have made people laugh. One time, I was on my way to camp with some of my friends. I looked out the window and saw a sign. I read it out in a funny way, saying, ""@CAPS1 butts, unless, that ""@CAPS2"" is an ""@CAPS3"" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 must be @CAPS1 @CAPS4."" It was so funny that I made everyone in the car burst into laughter.  Later on, during the drive to camp, we stopped at @CAPS5 in some city. When we stopped there, I got inside a shopping basket, and my friends and I were racing down the aisles, making all the other customers laugh. When we were about to leave, I bought a whole bunch of food.  When we were back inside the car, I grabbed the box of doughnuts I had bought and let everyone else in the car have one. We all started eating them and quickly realized that the doughnuts were really gross. They tasted so dry, it was like they didn't even have any frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and had to drink it with my doughnut just to make it taste a little bit more palatable. None of us wanted any more doughnuts. It was so funny that we ended up throwing the doughnuts out the window.  On the way back from the camp, my friend @PERSON1 was driving home, and I sat behind him and messed with him a lot. I turned my phone up to its highest volume and played a scary ring - tone, which scared him and made him jump. Then I licked my finger and put it inside his ear. He freaked out because he thought it was really disgusting. After that, he had his window open, and I opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm, scaring him again.  We stopped by a store in some small town and got some soda. I bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left, I said, ""@CAPS6't get pulled over, I just opened a beer. Haha."" Then I took a drink of my soda, and as I took the drink, I started laughing again, and some of my soda went up into my nose. I said, ""It burns so bad. My nose is burning."" All of us were laughing.  The ironic part was that about thirty minutes after I had said that, we got pulled over. We were driving down the highway, and my friend @PERSON1, who was driving, thought that the speed limit was sixty - five miles per hour, but it was actually fifty - five. The cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventy - five. I was going to try and make the cop laugh to lighten the mood, but my friend @PERSON1 said no because he was so mad. He ended up getting a ticket, and the cop was really dumb. He looked at the license plate and then turned and asked @PERSON1 if they were @LOCATION1 plates, when clearly they said right on them @LOCATION1. Everyone in the car laughed so hard; it was hilarious.  I don't think that anyone who went with me to camp that weekend stopped laughing. I am so good at making people laugh, and that is just one of my very awesome qualities, which will surely continue to bring joy to those around me."
690	21584	8	3	"Laughter... what is laughter? Do you expect me to tell you what laughter is? I wish I could, but I can't. Describing laughter is like describing what water tastes like or feels like (besides using the word wet). It's just one of those things that you think is easy to describe to someone because it's a part of your everyday life, but in reality, it's one of the most complex things out there.  Even though I can't describe it precisely, I do have a general concept of it. There are many reasons to laugh, different types of laughter, and various feelings behind it. In my case, I believe I'm a person who laughs quite often, almost every day. I laugh all the time, whether it's from seeing my friend fall, hearing a joke, remembering something funny from the past, or even from pure exhaustion (yes, I laugh several times when I'm just so worn out and stressed). The list goes on and on. In short, I live my life laughing every day.  I don't think I'm such a happy - go - lucky person who always makes others laugh alongside me, but I have gotten comments from my friends saying that's the case. This is one of the wonders of laughter: if you see someone laughing and enjoying their time, you just somehow end up laughing along with them. It makes me happy when I hear one of my friends say, ""Oh @PERSON1, you just made my day..."" because I know that I was able to make, even if just a little, their day nicer.  One time in my life, I met someone who is now very dear to me. It was @DATE1, and my friend @CAPS3 had invited me to The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in @CAPS6 to meet up with some of her @CAPS4 friends. The reunion was taking place in this coffee shop. I knew no one but her, so I felt really out of place. After just sitting back like a wallflower for a while, I decided to go to the ice - cream shop just next to the coffee shop. I realized that one of the boys in our group decided to come along too. We hung out, and he told me about himself, and I told him about myself as well.  After that day, we stayed connected. We had long - hour conversations through this video - calling site called @ORGANIZATION1. We chatted in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 every single day and even pulled all - nighters on the phone just talking to each other. After around a month of talking and staying connected, we became closer, close enough for him to talk about more serious matters with me.  This boy, whom I hold very dear, has had such a hard life. His adoptive father abused him every chance he got, and his adoptive mother just sat back and watched. His childhood friend, the one who was always by his side, the one he could do anything in the world with and who would never judge him, passed away in a car wreck in his second year of middle school. His life consisted of waking up in the mornings, walking to school, and being ignored by everyone around him. Coming back from school, he had to put up with his adoptive family screaming at him, calling him names,"
691	21586	8	3	When I think of laughter, you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six, my family and I went to my cousin's ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happiest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly opened my eyes from the long car ride, seeing the warm porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for someone to answer while the rest of my family were getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walked under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the couch. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him every time. He had brown hair, always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plaid tucked - in shirt. We always played goldfish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run towards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabbed me and started to tickle me till I fell on the floor and was screaming with laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me, picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 till I fell asleep. The next morning I woke up to hear coyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up. When I smelled bacon and eggs coming from the kitchen, I shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers, the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I started to play goldfish till we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curled up by the bales. Almost every footstep we took there was another snake curled up in the bales. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting, @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't too sure what he was doing till we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart - attack. We all came back inside to visit in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more goldfish at the table for the last time of my visit. The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor till they were done. When we were done we started loading up all our clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug goodbye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving goodbye. After we visited @DATE1, we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was here but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him, and those memories still bring a smile to my face.
692	21587	8	3	"I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life, it makes it so much better and easier. It's better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example, if you accidentally trip and fall in front of someone or even make a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always makes me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world, but it means a lot to me that they do it. Especially when I'm not feeling well or I just happen to be in a bad mood, they say something that'll make me laugh and I usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel like myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example, if someone says something totally stupid and no one else laughs but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone gets hurt pretty bad, like if they trip and fall hard. I wouldn't laugh at that because I wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if I fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that no one else knows about that happened to them, like for example, if they talk about what they did over the @DATE1 and how ""high"" or ""drunk"" they got. It's really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it, I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would I wanna hear about how you're ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well, that's my story and why I think the benefits of laughter are important. Laughter truly is a powerful tool that can brighten up even the darkest days."
693	21589	8	3	"They say laughter is the best medicine, and I personally think that's true. For one, jokes are a great thing for laughter, but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny, while some are just plain horrible. Another reason why laughter is so great is when you're laughing, that automatically means that you're in a good mood. I love to be happy or in a good mood; I hate being all mad or upset. It just isn't me. I love it when I can't breathe because I'm laughing so hard. Those are the best jokes. Also, you might even about wet yourself, especially if you're extremely ticklish. I know quite a few people that are, and I feel sorry for them because I would be downright embarrassed if I wet myself in front of anyone. My whole life has had laughter in it. To me, anytime is laughter time. Well, I have quite a few stories about laughter, but I am only going to tell you one. It's one of my favorites. It's when me and my friends are all hanging out at my grandma's house for my @NUM1 birthday party. We're all having a great time on the homemade slip - and - slide, enjoying the food and the drinks (soda, of course, not alcohol). But anyway, my cousin @PERSON1 has these games that he came up with, like the @CAPS1 relay, @CAPS2 fishing, @CAPS3 the gum in the whipped cream, and my favorite, @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is a game where you can have as many players as you want. All the supplies you need are a lot of string, a lot of balloons, and one person to start out as the @CAPS4. Say you have @NUM2 humans and one @CAPS4. All the humans would have balloons tied around their waists. They all try to run away from the @CAPS4 and they can hide anywhere inside the boundaries. It doesn't matter how your balloon pops, who pops it, or what pops it. Once it is popped, you're a @CAPS4 until there are @CAPS12 humans left, then you start a new game. Now you might ask yourself why this is funny. Well, I'm going to tell you why. We're all at my party having a great time, right? My cousin @PERSON1 says, ""Who wants to play the game @CAPS4?"" We all say, ""Well, what's that?"" He goes over all the rules like I said before, and we say, ""Let's play."" We're all running away, and all of the sudden we start hearing my cousin's @CAPS4 noise that means he's coming. He freaked out and ran away. When he leaves, you can hear the screeching scream come out, and you hear his balloon pop, which means that he got out. We're all laughing because when he flew, he launched about @NUM3 feet backwards. It was the funniest thing ever because when I got over there, he was still on the ground. Everyone was trying to breathe. I swear I think everyone was about to wet themselves. They probably would've laughed some more if it wasn't for the game. Then @CAPS9 got up and started chasing people with my cousin @PERSON1, and the rest of us ran out of there as quickly as possible. Yet again, you hear my cousin making his @CAPS4 noise, people running, screaming, and my friend trying to make the same @CAPS4 noise but can't. One by one, I hear the balloons popping. Soon I was the last one left. I was gonna give up because I was getting chased and chased until I was completely out of breath. Then one of my friends @ORGANIZATION1 comes up in front of me, and I said, ""I don't care. Get me out. I wanna lay down."" He took the balloon and popped it. I asked, ""Can I take a nap?"" He said, ""No, because we have to get ready for the next round. You better rest up quick or you'll be dog - tired."" I rested up as much as I could before we got everyone strapped up for the next game. I was hoping to get some kind of reward for winning the very first game of @CAPS4, but my cousin @PERSON1 had to be a smart - aleck about it and say, ""Getting to play the game isn't a big enough reward for you, stingy!"" As always, everyone starts busting up laughing at every single little thing that my cousin @PERSON1 does, but I do have to admit that he is one of the funniest guys that I have ever met. There you go. There is my story about laughter, but I do have plenty more, but I think I've wasted too much of your time. That's all I have to say, and laughter really can turn an ordinary day into an unforgettable one."
694	21592	8	3	We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter is definitely the most important part of my best friend's and my relationship. Without laughter, we couldn't possibly have as much fun together as we do. If I am having a bad day, I can always count on my best friend to make me crack up and forget about the day I have had. If we are out and about or just relaxing at home, my best friend and I are always laughing. The end result is usually us both with tear - streaked faces from laughing so hard. There are actually quite a few different instances in which I remember laughing particularly hard. This last @CAPS1 @CAPS2's eve, for example, it started snowing at around three a.m., so my best friend and I ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs. Snowballs started coming from every direction. During a game of hide and go seek, we decided to bury ourselves in a snow - covered leaf pile. Within ten minutes, our legs were freezing. So what did we do? We put on our swimsuits and jumped into the bathtub together. Having her there to laugh with me made the situation a lot better. Another situation in which I remember being particularly funny was the entire third trimester of freshman @CAPS2. I needed a first - period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing. I definitely was not looking forward to it, until I found out that my best friend had it with me. We made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every single stupid mistake we made. Since we are not exactly experienced in the field of metal, there were quite a few mistakes. Without my best friend there to laugh with me, I have no idea what I would have done. I believe that whenever I am in a bad situation, laughter will always help me. One last situation in which laughter helped a lot is when I used it to cheer up my best friend. A couple of days ago, my friend had had a really bad day. Things just weren't going her way. After school, I could tell something was wrong. I tried talking to her about it, but that wasn't really helping. So, I brought up some of our past experiences together. Within a few minutes, she was laughing and I could tell she felt a lot better. Laughter really does help us out of some tough situations. Laughter is by far the most important factor in my best friend's and my relationship. Our relationship is mainly based on laughter. Without it, we just wouldn't be as close as we are today. If we need it to cheer each other up or cure boredom, I know that laughter will always be on our side, and it will continue to strengthen our bond for years to come.
695	21594	8	3	It was midsummer, and I could feel the cool ocean breeze washing over my skin. You would think everything would be calm, but it was the exact opposite. I wouldn't talk to him or even look at him.
696	21595	8	3	Have you ever experienced a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard your stomach hurt, and your eyes were filled with tears? Laughing is something every person needs. A great laugh can brighten a person's day and put a genuine smile on their face. If no one laughed, the world would be a terribly sad place. My friends and I are always laughing, to the point where we're rolling on the ground, clutching our stomachs in fits of laughter. We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing, just enjoying the moment. I honestly don't know who I'd be if I didn't laugh, or what I would become.   I remember this one time when my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, and I were having an off day. We all woke up in bad moods, with a sense of irritation lingering from the start. Everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen, noisily banging pans and pots around. When we finally got out of bed, our favorite cereal was gone. So we thought of going to the donut shop, but no one would take us. Even though I realize that's not the end of the world now, it seemed like it then. My brother and sisters were a constant source of annoyance, with the @LOCATION1 blasting and them running around the house, yelling at the top of their lungs. We were already mad, and their actions just added fuel to the fire. The dog and cats were also being a nuisance, constantly trying to sneak into the house. And to top it all off, the weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing, matching our moods perfectly. We were all ready to call it quits on the day before it had even really started.   We eventually decided to get up and get ready, trying to shake off the bad vibes. We came up with a plan to walk down to the river behind my house, even in the poor weather. The river was located after our big backyard and past the quad track, so it was about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river, she firmly said no. She didn't want us walking down there by ourselves, even though we had already done it a few times before. We begged and pleaded, but we soon knew she wasn't going to let us. That put us yet again in a foul mood. We had to go find something new to do, and it didn't seem like there were many options. We lived clear out of town, about @NUM1 miles away, which was not exactly walking distance. But as the day went on, we managed to find other ways to have fun and forget about our earlier troubles, realizing that laughter can still be found even on the toughest days.
697	21596	8	3	I woke up just like any other day, feeling happy yet lacking the much - needed sleep. As I got out of bed, I would have never known that this day would be the funniest day of my life. I went through my usual morning routine to get ready for school. When I got to school, everything seemed like our normal homecoming until there was an unexpected announcement on the intercoms. It told everybody out of nowhere that there was a dance tonight.   So after school was done, me and my friends were eager to head over to our houses to get dressed for the dance. We took our time to pick out the best outfits, wanting to look our best. After we were all dressed, @PERSON1 picked us all up in a nice car, and we headed to the dance looking really stylish.   When we got there, everybody was looking dressed to dance, looking their glamorous best. Except one guy, he stood out like a sore thumb. He was wearing corduroy pants with a red tucked - in flannel and some brown worn - out work boots. We looked at him from head to toe and thought to ourselves, are we in a messed - up hillbilly dream? That was just the beginning of what was yet to come.   As everybody started to get in the groove of the beat, we soon all started dancing to the music. The music was really good, and everybody was having a great time, even the kid with the flannel. But just as everything was going smoothly, a song came on that was called cotton eyed @CAPS1. When the flanneled kid heard this song, he almost jumped out of his corduroy pants. He soon started kicking and swinging his feet and arms wildly, as if they had no bone or joints in them. Everybody started to form a circle around the kid, and we were all laughing and copying the kid's crazy movements, even us. He didn't really care; he just kept dancing and singing to the song with so much enthusiasm.   The funniest thing about this was that the dance was a formal one, and yet this kid managed to pull off wearing a flannel, some boots, and a pair of corduroy pants. This kid was truly out of his mind. In fact, we still laugh and talk about it to this day, as it will always be a hilarious memory of that amazing day.
698	21598	8	3	Laughter is an important part of my life. Either my friends are making me laugh or I am making them laugh. One prime example is on the @DATE1, I, @PERSON1, and three of my closest buddy's went hunting. That trip was the best and at the same time the worst hunting experience of my life. It was the worst because we shot and missed at two bears and one of the biggest bucks of my life. We were so close, but somehow, our shots just didn't hit the mark. But it was the best because we all reached that tired state when every little thing was funny. Even the smallest things would set us off into fits of laughter. The trip turned out to be a failure in terms of hunting, but the most important thing was that we had a blast. There were @CAPS1 teen - age boys riding around in a pick - up truck, making each other laugh non - stop, sharing jokes and funny stories.   Another example was one @DATE1 this @DATE2, I, @PERSON1, and two boat - loads of my friends went on a trip to a nearby fishing hole called @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1 is a small, quiet place that not very many people go to. It is very peaceful, with the sound of the water gently lapping against the shore and the birds chirping in the background. I brought out my fifteen - foot duck/fishing boat and my ten - foot canoe. I was controlling the big boat, the only boat with a motor, and towing behind us was the canoe. Inside the canoe was @PERSON1 and two kids that don't mean to be funny, but you can't help but to laugh at them. Their innocent actions and reactions were always a source of amusement.   We were having a good @DATE1 of fishing, casting our lines and waiting patiently for a bite. But as the day was starting to wrap up, we encountered an unexpected situation. On our way back, we stopped to fix a pole, and in the process, the slack in the rope that was pulling the canoe became slack. When we started to move again, the slack tightened suddenly, and the canoe lurched forward. Unbeknown to @PERSON1, who was standing up at the time, this caused him to almost fall out. When I say almost, I mean the only thing left in the boat was his feet and his hands, which were desperately holding on to the side rail. The only part that was in the water was his butt. This turned out to be the highlight of the trip, and we still bring it up from time to time, always laughing at the memory. My friends and I have a lot of adventures. Most of them turn out bad in some way, but all of them turn out funny, creating memories that will last a lifetime.
699	21599	8	3	I sat at the table, completely speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early, and the doctor's prognosis was grim. He told her that the baby would only live for three days at the most. As she told me this, she stared off into the distance, as if she were reliving every moment of that terrifying time. She then went on to explain that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the normal rigid structure. She described those first days in great detail, how scared she was, not knowing if her little one would make it through the night. Seeing @PERSON2 sitting next to her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had defied the odds and lived longer.   @PERSON1 continued to tell me about how as @PERSON2 grew older, he faced more challenges. He couldn't walk. His pediatrician was very pessimistic, telling her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. But @PERSON2 was a fighter. He was given another miracle. With the aide of a camouflage cane, he managed to beat the odds once again and take those first precious steps.   @PERSON1 also told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only communicates through sign language. She took the time to teach me how to take care of him, showing me the little things that made his life more comfortable. He was just a normal kid at heart, who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different from the rest of the kids, just with a few more obstacles to overcome.   This was going to be a roller - coaster of a week. I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived at @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours, and yet they were opening up to me, sharing their life story. I was given the amazing opportunity to spend the next week becoming best friends with @PERSON2. We went on all sorts of adventures together. We went swimming in the river, feeling the cool water on our skin. We played with sticks, using our imaginations to create all sorts of games. We went on nature walks, exploring the beautiful surroundings and learning about the different plants and animals. And we even rode a horse, with @PERSON2's face lighting up with excitement. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, feeling the rush of the water as we sped down the river. We rode on jet skis, the wind in our faces. And we fished in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something, patiently waiting for a tug on our lines.   Having the best time of our lives, we parted each night to bed. He went to his cabin, and I went to my tent. Each night as I left, I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience.   One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go, putting all his effort into it. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated, feeling like he was being held back by his condition. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy.   That night I went to our @CAPS4 director, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened. He led me to the garage, which was in a complete mess. It was so chaotic and unorganized, with tools and parts scattered everywhere. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. It was a beautiful sight, with foot straps and a supportive seat, complete with dragons painted on it and a bell that rang cheerfully. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1.   The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before, and I knew he could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him, and gave him a gentle push to start him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces as we watched him achieve this amazing feat. It was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new - found capability was a sight I will never forget. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin and continued to ride in circles around his bunk.   I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself. The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came, the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, and they trusted me. I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends, and we couldn
700	21601	8	3	As I remember back, it was @DATE1. It was a hot, humid day. I can remember that day like it was yesterday. I woke up that morning and decided I was going to go swimming. But the only problem was I had no one to go with me, and @CAPS2 attitude was turning for the worst. The day @CAPS1 off fairly well for the most part. I called around to all @CAPS2 friends to see what they were doing for that particular day, but as I went down @CAPS2 friend line everyone seemed to be to busy to go anywhere with me. I was most certainly bummed. @CAPS2 happy go lucky attitude turned into the dumps really fast. The only thing that was left for me to do was use @CAPS2 back up plan, @CAPS2 aunt. We gathered our swimming gear, blankets, tanning lotion, and ourselves and packed it in the back of the van and headed towards @ORGANIZATION1. I was really not in the best of moods, and it seemed that everyone that was around me was turning into a grump as well. Totally bummed that all of @CAPS2 friends had ditched me and left me to hang with @CAPS2 aunt all day wasn't @CAPS2 explanation of fun, sorry enough to say, but it wasn't.  As the day went on the more I thought about @CAPS2 friends the more I got frustrated. Then finally it came to me, why let their stupidity of ditching (the best thing that had happened to them) me, ruin @CAPS2 day. I @CAPS1 laughing and having a grand time, and pretty soon, in all reality forgot why was having a bad day. When we got to our swimming hole, I looked around and noticed that everything was well. Everyone there was having fun. So I @CAPS1 to loosen up and have a good time. Jumping off rocks, making a fool of myself, laughing, and having a good time. We spent the whole day enjoying with what we had.  When I got home and I had realized what an awesome day @CAPS2 day had turned out to be, I realized that I shouldn't let @CAPS2 friends get me down. Laughing and having a good time can make any day turn around for the best. The most important lesson that I have learned from @CAPS2 experience that day, is to make the best out of each situation. Don't let crushed plans crush your self confidence. Put a smile on your face and turn your frown upside down and laugh. laughter makes life better.
701	21603	8	3	Some say that laughter is the common language between people, bridging gaps from individual to individual, and nation to nation. If that is true, those hearty laughters can seemingly speak all the languages around the world. In our daily lives, we all genuinely need laughters to be around us. When people laugh, they don't just benefit themselves, but also all the people in their vicinity. There is a result from those who study psychology; they noticed that people don't cry because they are sad, rather they become sad because they cry. The same goes for laughing; people are happy because they laugh!  I remember once, when I was in middle school, every student in my class needed to go on the stage and do a presentation. Before the presentation began, the classroom was dead quiet. Everyone was silent, and there was not a single voice because we were all extremely nervous. You could even hear a pen drop. I sat at my desk, fidgeting, and had no idea what to do. I was so nervous that I thought I would pass out at any second. I believed that was what my friends were thinking, too. Suddenly, we all heard a kid laughing! I didn't know what he was laughing about, but soon the whole class started to laugh! You could feel that the tense and nervous situation was quickly gone! Everyone started to talk animatedly and walk around freely. That helped me calm myself down. I felt the big and heavy burden that was on my shoulder suddenly disappear! This story was so unforgettable because I realized how a simple laughter could change the situation from bad to good.  Laughter could change the whole world from a state of danger to peace. I am someone who loves laughter. I love to laugh because when I laugh, I feel that everything around me becomes better. It could be in both positive or negative situations, but laughter does make my life more bearable. People who are around me think that I am fun to be with because they can clearly feel the joy I bring to them.  Laughter is an important part of a relationship. My friend and I, when we get together, we always laugh about everything, from some random old house to the vast sky. We really have a great time together. There was one time that I wondered, what if nobody in my group laughed when we were together? That would surely be no fun anymore! Without laughters, the distance between my friends and me would become a huge gap, but with laughter, we would have no distance between us at all! Then I noticed another group of people. Maybe they just had a bad day, and there were no smiles on their faces. When they sat together during the lunch time, nobody talked or laughed. They seemed as if they were no longer friends. After a few days, they started to talk again and laughed just like they were good friends again! I realized that laughter could change everything. It could change not only the dynamics inside a relationship but also how people view that relationship.  Laughters do help us out a great deal. On mental, physical, and social aspects, they bring benefits to our lives. Laughter truly is a powerful force that enriches our existence and strengthens our bonds with others.
702	21604	8	3	"Laughter is an integral element in various situations. These situations can vary greatly, ranging from natural disasters to the simple desire to be cheered up or to be amused. Humor can make light of circumstances, no matter how grave, terrifying, or uneasing they may be. The recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in @LOCATION2 made me extremely worried for my friend @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION1, which at that time, I and many of my other friends thought was close to some of the more severely affected areas. Of course, we were all deeply scared for him, but we tried our best to make light of this disastrous situation. Our fears were further intensified when he never logged onto the ning or Facebook. However, we know now that was just because the electricity was down for him that night (our night).  When we finally learned that he was safe, at least for the time being, we were all incredibly relieved. Humor really helped to diffuse the tense situation, just as it has done many times before. As of now, this is still a story in the making because as this is being written, there are still great dangers looming over that region. Not the least of which is the ever - present threat of nuclear meltdown. The jokes have continued into the week.  I believe humor can be very helpful during worrying times because making light of a serious situation, in a way, makes it feel less overwhelming. Of course, many people look down upon doing this, which is completely understandable. They either don't see that we are genuinely fearful or don't understand and believe we're just joking about it to be ""edgy"" or ""offensive"". People who feel the need to joke about dangerous situations aren't intent upon being malicious or uncaring. Most often, they are people with a sense of humor and a deep - seated sense of distress. In times of crisis, humor can be a coping mechanism that helps us deal with the uncertainty and fear, allowing us to find a glimmer of hope in the midst of chaos."
703	21605	8	3	One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going absolutely crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as her little legs could carry her, and no one had the slightest idea why. I thought it was so incredibly funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually, @PERSON1 took @PERSON3 into her room to see if she would calm down. But to her dismay, @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room, and the more she did that, the harder I laughed. It was like the funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life.  This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this hyper. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was. We guessed that @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went downstairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculously. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously, the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before.  Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister, came downstairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running too fast to catch her and was way too crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @PERSON1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else we could do but sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog.  To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3. She was just insanely hyper and out of this world that day. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4, and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that day. But they didn't find it as funny as I did. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way too hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of that day. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was truly a funny moment! I haven't laughed that hard since then. Looking back, that day was filled with unexpected and hilarious moments, all thanks to the crazy antics of @PERSON3.
704	21606	8	3	LAUGHTER: Everyone knows that laughter is a healing medicine. It has the power to ease a lot of aches and pains, such as the deep - seated hole in someone's heart after a breakup or the long - lasting suffering of someone unable to provide for their family. However, the kind of aches laughter eased in my life was the intense pain from the loss of a dear friend and an amazing teacher.  Recently, one of the best teachers I've ever had the chance to know passed away. He was trying to get into the @ORGANIZATION1 to set up his detailed lesson plans for the @TIME1, when the fatal incident happened. <@NUM1</@CAPS2> had a doctor's appointment that day and had arranged for a substitute to take his place. It was six o'clock in the @TIME1, and it was still dark outside as @PERSON2 tried to open the doors of the @ORGANIZATION1. Before he knew it, he collapsed on the ground, waiting for someone to come to his aid. Eventually, @PERSON1, the janitor, came out, spotted him and quickly called @NUM2. The ambulance rushed to come pick him up and sped him to the hospital for emergency care. As soon as they got there, they found out he had had a heart attack. He'd had a couple of minor ones before this one. However, this heart attack was severe. It took his life, and they weren't able to revive him. @PERSON2 was pronounced dead on the day of @DATE1.  Our principal called for an emergency assembly when we all had arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 that @TIME1. We had known something was wrong, considering the strange and solemn looks on all of our teachers' faces. All the students gathered together in the small gym of our @ORGANIZATION1. The air was thick with anticipation as we waited for something to happen. After a short while, a man we all knew walked out in front of us with a microphone in his hand. With slumped shoulders and a grim, sorrowful face, @PERSON3, our principal, told us of the tragic news. My mouth fell open, and I gasped in disbelief. I could hear people shifting in their seats and whispering among themselves as they struggled to come to terms with the devastating news. Looking around, I saw the same shocked and heart - broken expressions on many of my classmates' faces. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to cry, but the shock held back my tears. @PERSON3 explained the situation further as we listened intently to the painful words coming out of his mouth. I was in a state of shock. I just couldn't believe that @PERSON2 was gone.  After our principal was finished speaking, we were led out of the gym by melancholy teachers and told to report to our first - period class. As I made my way to my locker, I heard soft sobbing, but it was mostly a silent kind of grief. I quickly grabbed the folder for my first class and closed the locker, eager to get out of the hallway and into a more private area. Walking into the classroom, I sat at my desk. People in my class filed in through the door and took their seats as well. Our teacher for that class didn't say a word to us, so we presumed we weren't going to do any work. Sitting there in silence and feeling utterly helpless, I put my head down on my desk and started to cry. It really happened, I thought to myself. The reality of the situation was starting to sink in.  By the end of first period, the sleeve of my sweatshirt was soaked in tears and mascara. Nobody had really said much, but that was okay. Seeing that I had been crying, some people stopped to give me a comforting hug as I slowly walked down the hallway to my second - period class. I expected my next class to be a lot like the first, but it wasn't. In place of the cold silence, there was the gentle sound of music. Instead of crying alone, people were being comforted by their friends. Students were making cards for @PERSON2's family. We were all reminiscing about the good times we had with @PERSON2. We retold the funny stories he told us of his life in the classes he taught. We laughed when we remembered how he couldn't hang up anything straight and that the evidence was still on his classroom walls. For the first time in that already long and tragic day, we felt a bit better. We felt as if we could celebrate his life, not just mourn his loss.  The rest of the day was bearable. Not because we lost a great teacher, but because we could remember and cherish a great teacher. Laughter eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day. We could remember and laugh about the good times we had in the classroom with him throughout our school years. We could remember the wonderful man @PERSON2 was through the warm feeling in our hearts. Laughter brought us together in a time of great need, helping us to heal and move forward.
705	21607	8	3	LAUGHTER @CAPS1 knows that laughter is a healing medicine. It has the power to ease a lot of aches and pains, such as the hole in someone's heart after a breakup or the suffering of someone unable to provide for their family. However, the kind of aches laughter eased in my life was the pain from the loss of a dear friend and teacher. Recently, one of the best teachers I've gotten the chance to know passed away. He was trying to get into the @ORGANIZATION1 to set up his lesson plans for the @TIME1, when the fatal incident happened. <@NUM1</@CAPS2> had a doctor's appointment that day and had gotten a substitute to take his place. It was six o'clock in the @TIME1 and still dark out as @PERSON2 tried to open the doors of the @ORGANIZATION1. Before he knew it, he was down on the ground waiting for someone to come help. Eventually, @PERSON1, the janitor, came out, spotted him and quickly called @NUM2. The ambulance hustled to come pick him up and rushed him to the hospital for emergency care. As soon as they got there, they found out he had had a heart attack. He'd had a couple minor ones before this one. However, this heart attack was big. It took his life and they weren't able to revive him. @PERSON2 was pronounced dead on the day of @DATE1.  Our principle called for an emergency assembly when we all had arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 that @TIME1. We had known something was wrong, considering the strange looks on all of our teachers' faces. All the students gathered together in the small gym of our @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. The air was filled with anticipation as we waited for something to happen. After a bit, a man we all knew walked out in front of us with a microphone in his hand. With slumped shoulders and a grim face, @PERSON3, our principle, told us of the tragic news. My mouth fell open and I gasped. I could hear people adjusting in their seats and murmuring among themselves as they struggled to take in the devastating news. Looking around, I saw the same shocked expressions on @CAPS1 of my classmates' faces. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't just yet. @PERSON3 explained the situation further as we intently listened to the sickening words coming out of his mouth. I was in shock. I didn't believe that @PERSON2 was gone.  After our principle was finished speaking, we were ushered out of the gym by melancholy teachers and told to report to our first period class. As I made my way to my locker, I heard sobbing, but it was mostly silent. I quickly grabbed the folder for my first class and closed the locker, wanting to get out of the hallway and into a more private area. Walking into the classroom, I sat at my desk.

Sitting there in silence and feeling helpless I put my head down on my desk and started to cry. It really happened, I thought to myself. The reality of the @TIME1 was setting in.  By the end of first period, the sleeve of my sweatshirt was drenched in tears and mascara. Nobody had really said anything, but that was okay. Seeing that I had been crying, people stopped to hug me as I sluggishly walked down the hallway to my second period class. I expected my next class to be a lot like the first, but it wasn't. In place of the cold silence, was the soft sound of music. Instead of crying by themselves, people were being comforted by friends. Students were making cards for @PERSON2's family. We were all reminiscing the good times we had with @PERSON2. We retold the stories he told us of his life in the classes he taught. We remembered the funny crack he would get in his voice when he raised it in even the slightest way. We laughed when we remembered how he couldn't hang up anything straight and that the evidence was on his classroom walls. For the first time in that already long day, we felt alright. We felt as if we could celebrate his life, not mourn it.  The rest of the day was alright. Not because we lost a great teacher, but because we could love and appreciate a great teacher. Laughter eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day. We could remember and laugh about the good times we had in the classroom with him throughout our @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1 years. We could remember the man @PERSON2 was through the small tickle in our bellies. Laughter brought us together in a time of need.
706	21608	8	3	One thing that people in the world love to do the most is laugh. Why is it that we like to laugh? Laughter is extremely important in our lives because it brings us pure joy, unbridled happiness, and most of all it just fills our stomachs with butterflies, that delightful fluttering feeling. One major thing about laughter is the whole point of view. Of course everyone makes jokes, does dorky things, or simply makes a funny comment. All those things cause laughter. Sometimes laughter helps people grow a good relationship and it builds up to be strong. In relationships like boyfriend/girlfriend, parents with their children, family, or even friends have to have some laughter in their relationship because if not then that would be a boring relationship. At times it's hard to bring laughter into the picture but we at least need to try to laugh as it is healthy for us to laugh once in a while. In families, it's important to grow a relationship with the child or parents and they need those funny feelings in their stomachs that make them giggly inside and it's all called laughter. Friends always will have funny moments to laugh about, it's sometimes the pranks that they do to each other, the funny comments, the jokes and it's easy as that to start laughing and creating the good relationship with just laughing with each other. Sometimes laughter could cause bad things if we use it for bad things and that could cause a bad relationship. We also don't want to hurt someone's feelings by laughing at them because of something that happened or if someone made a comment, because that could leave us not laughing too much after we lose a relationship with someone. The smiles that people have on their faces is a wonderful thing to see. In all relationships, laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handy. People have bad days sometimes and we always try to make them happy and how do we do that? Well, it's called laughing. I know if I was having a bad day and I felt all depressed and mushy I would like someone to make me laugh by simply saying a hilarious joke. In my personal opinion, I love laughing and especially making people around me laugh. At times I have my bad times and need some laughter in my system to make me feel at least better. I know that sadness can sometimes take over but we all need to think positive and not let the negative things take over. Life is so much better if we all have laughter in them. Imagine the world with just laughter, how life would be. I wish that could happen because that would make everyone full of happiness and smiles on their faces. In my personal life, my family and friends are full of laughter. I have to make jokes at times when things are getting difficult and everyone is freaking out. Laughter is a part of us either we like it or not it's always going to be with us no matter what. Eventually I would say that laughter is an element in my life that I will always carry and I hope that everyone in the world has the element of laughter in them because seriously it's important in this world.
707	21609	8	3	Laughter, to me, is an important aspect of my relationship with anyone. I cherish laughter, and I employ it at every chance that I receive. To many, laughter may be trivial, but to me, it holds the key to my relationships with other people. Without laughter, many of the wonderful people I have met in my life, might not be there because I used laughter to develop them into friendships. Friends were hard to come by in my childhood. I did not make good choices, not with whom I associated myself with; rather, with how I approached other people for the first time. I would come off as brash, rude, or annoying, to name a few among many. I had no experience with making relationships, and the first impression is very important. Just like any meal, the first sense that is appealed to, is sight. The image of the meal floods the mind, next, the enticing aroma floats aimlessly towards you, and you begin to salivate in anticipation. And like any recipe, to perfect it, you must practice, and that is what I did. It was a long and arduous process, but come my sophomore year in [High School Name], I began to feel like I mastered the art of making other people laugh. As students, and individuals, people come and go, we may truly end up forgetting their entire being, or we may leave an impression on their mind. I try this through laughter; to be remembered if not, only for a day. Using laughter, I acquired new opportunities to make friends, and I did not squander those opportunities. I surrounded myself in a net of laughter, I developed the necessary skills to make people laugh. I enjoyed it, and I still do. One relationship that I built, is with a young woman. I had never spoken to her before, until our teacher put us into a group together. Laughter was the essential building block of our future relationship. I was myself, I would not pretend to be someone I'm not, I would express puns that our youth are so fond of, euphemisms our generation know all too well. We would listen to the same music, and gradually, our relationship was nurtured into a stead - fast friendship. It has developed to the point where, in class, we long for each other's company. We look for classes to have together because we love to make each other laugh. And because of laughter, I have made a friend with whom I share secrets, time, and moments with which I shall forever cherish. Recently she has decided to start playing tennis. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I would like nothing more to help her, and whomever so decides to partake in my leadership. I do not necessarily claim to be the best, but I am confident in my abilities to teach the techniques, and fundamentals of the game. There is not much more I would like to do, that is to play the sport that I love, with the woman I love. And most of the credit belongs to laughter because, when her amiable face lights up from something I said, it means all the world to me, whether she knows it, or not. I have many such connections with other people from both sexes, but none so much as hers. I worked hard to build connections with other people because they would make life that much easier, and that much more enjoyable. In [High School Name] there are no exclusive social groups, or roving bands of football players ready to pick out the weakest of the student population. We are all friends, we are all one community, we all belong, and that is due, in part, by laughter. Laughter connects people from around the world, it is the universal language every race, skin color, and religion all speak. It can bring us together or it can tear us apart, but in life, the medicine most prescribed, is laughter.
708	21610	8	3	"People always say that the worst parts of life are the sad parts, the moments where no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments trump the problems caused by work, or by the society, and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone is feeling joy so strong that it pours out of them in the way of a suppressed giggle or booming laugh, are the times that make life worth living, worth the jobs and the bad breakups and the over - priced society. It has been said by those infamous ""they"" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones remembered forever because they hold the most emotion, but I have to disagree with ""them"". Moments in the life whether they be seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished also if they are built up by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently was my birthday. This year it fell on a [Day of the Week] and I had made no plans to celebrate in any way. Sure my parents had gotten me loads of presents but the joy and jittery excitement that I had always felt previous to my birthday wasn't in me. These feelings were most likely because this year I had decided that now that I was in high school, birthday parties were a no - go. With no plans or exciting activities to await, my birthday was not eagerly looked forward to as it had been every year previous. What would I do?! I definitely didn't want to spend the day home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what I did almost every other normal [Day of the Week]. These thoughts and realizations brought that sad lonely feeling in me, those feelings that make up the worst parts of life. My mom, noticing my birthday gloom, suggested a trip to the beach and a one - night stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go as far as to say that it's my favorite place in the world. I also love yurts. Yurts are big round cabins made from canvas draped around a wood structure, with a skylight directly at the top of the pointed roof where you could see the stars at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach sounded better to me than being at home, so naturally I agreed to the beach trip. Way deep down I was excited, I was thrilled, a beach trip with my family! In my head I was stuck still in my foggy state of gloom as thoughts swirled in my head about how I would not have a good time if there were no friends to laugh and hang out with, and how much of a loser I was for not doing anything with friends but instead my family. Our household consists of my mom, dad, and two sisters ages four and [Number] months. We are not the most well - functioning family. I find my older sister to be an annoying brat sent by the devil to ruin my life and make everything my fault. Two out of the three of us girls have to always be in some kind of brawl, and that drives my mother crazy which gets her all flustered and my dad angry until we realize that some small thing has ruffled all of our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined my family birthday beach trip to turn out like, but caused by a long car drive and hungry kids rather than that small thing. The day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mom, bless her, made a family announcement to us that today was my day and anything I wanted was what I got. This meant that I got to choose what we would eat, what we would do and could make any comment including telling my little sisters to bug off if I wanted to. By lunch, we had visited the beach, gotten settled in our yurt, and enjoyed a lunch made up of various snacks we had brought along and I found that I was enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised a voice, made a snarky comment or did anything to upset the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all its odd fish I laughed. I laughed at my sisters when they were doing silly things. I laughed at the things my mother told me. We all laughed at a bicyclist running into a pole, and fish doing vacuum - like motions with their lips. All the laughing, all the smiles did a lot for me. It pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me to see all of the love that circled around in my family, it made the love visible. It's healthy to laugh. Without laughter in our lives, some things like love, that can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter. Laughter truly has the power to transform our experiences and bring out the best in our relationships."
709	21611	8	3	Why is it that people can look back at something and laugh, but not while the action is taking place? For example, if you were to witness someone being hit by a car. During that event, nobody would be laughing. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the [TV Show Name] and it is considered comedic. On a hot [Day of the Week] [Time of the Day], something quite similar happened to me and my friends. I live next to the [Location Name]. I know of this one spot on the [Location Name], it's called [Organization Name] [Organization Name]. It has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because of the reflection of the trees that surround it. The [Location Name] is about thirty yards wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff - side, which ranges from [Number] feet to [Number] feet. On the other side of the [Location Name], there is a beautiful, golden beach with massive trees behind it. The hike to [Organization Name] is about one mile of steep decline, which leads right to the cliff's edge. The [Location Name] bed and the gorge is lined up just the way that it is shaded for most of the day, except in the mornings. On this particular day, I was going to bring [Friend's Name 1], [Friend's Name 2], [Friend's Name 3], and [Friend's Name 4]. My friend [Friend's Name 1] is a dare - devil. Although he's not very good at athletic things, he is willing to try just about anything. He was also home - schooled until freshman year of high school, so he's also pretty socially awkward and definitely not used to resisting negative peer pressure. On the other hand, I am the kid to do crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was doing gainers off of the cliff's edge that was only about [Number] feet off the water. Somehow, [Friend's Name 1] ended up getting pressured into trying one as well. As he was getting mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a count down. [Number], [Number], [Number], [Word]! We all shouted at the same time. He ran to the cliff - side, just like I showed him, he jumped out, then brought his knees to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, [Friend's Name 1] tucked
710	21613	8	3	Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing. 
711	21615	8	3	I woke up, feeling morose and somnolent. I woke up specifically to go to @LOCATION1. I was going to @LOCATION1 to watch a few basketball games. Unfortunately, I was unable to partake in the activity because I was @CAPS1 injured during the previous week of practice. Even though I couldn't play, I still had to go and support my friends and teammates. It was about @NUM1 o'clock when we all boarded the bus and set off to @LOCATION1. All of my friends were in high spirits, being mirthful and talkative. But me, I was just in a lackadaisical stare. The bus ride felt like it lasted an eternity, but in two hours, we finally arrived at our destination. @LOCATION1 had a nice - looking school, yet we soon found that it sometimes resembled a ghost town. The high school seemed lifeless compared to other schools we'd played at in the past. There was no one around, and not a sound could be heard. We all sat there patiently waiting. Then, after about five minutes, a man showed up and led us to the locker rooms. The boys had to wait until the girls finished their game. So, we went to one of the auxiliary courts and started shooting. Sadly, due to my injury, I couldn't participate. They were having a great time down there, just screwing around. The thought of not being with them made me feel really bad. After the girls' game, we all went to change. Then we sat there, joking around and waiting for our coach to come in and give us our pre - game pep talk. It seemed like forever before our coach finally entered the locker room. He talked about what we should and shouldn't do to get the win. When the game started, I was really getting depressed, but I forced myself to cheer on my team. The first half of the game was great, and we were leading. However, the second half wasn't so good. We only scored six points and ended up losing the game by a large margin. My friends tried to be stoical, but I could tell they were ashamed of their second - half performance. This made me feel sad and depressed all over again. Next, I had to watch two more games in the old, uncomfortable bleachers of @LOCATION1. The first of the two games was exciting; we won by two points. The second game, though, was really boring. It seemed to drag on forever, and the worst part was that we lost. After that final game, I had to wait for my cousin to come out of the locker room. When he did, we went to check out with our coaches so we could ride home with our parents. So off we went, but first, we had to get something to eat. As usual, we chose to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. We went through the drive - through, got our food, and then pulled over to eat. At first, everything seemed fine, but then my cousin noticed he didn't get the @CAPS2 he ordered. So we went inside to get it sorted. After that, we were joking about the restaurant getting the order wrong. Then I took a bite of my burger and realized it didn't have a patty. I was really upset that @ORGANIZATION1 made such a silly mistake. So we went in again. After that, we were all kind of laughing about it. It was a long day, but it was still a part of the basketball experience.
712	21617	8	3	"A while back, my mom made the decision to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I first heard this news, I was pretty upset because I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started, I did everything I could to convince my mom not to let me go. But after a while, I knew I wasn't going to get my way. And before I knew it, I was on my way to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there weren't many people there. But when I finally reached the camp, I was wrong. There were a lot of people I didn't know, and it was extremely scary. By then, it was too late to go home. Walking to my cabin was nerve - racking because I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward. Firstly, we didn't know each other, and secondly, our counselor was so strange. Right after meeting, our counselor made us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 with strangers at first was really strange, but after a while, we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls wasn't as scary as it could have been since we'd had so much fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other well. When lunch was over, the first thing we did was play @CAPS2 again. The more we laughed and had fun, the more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1, we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, just giggling and laughing. @DATE2 came along on the second @DATE1 of camp, and by then, we'd almost become friends just by laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2"" instead of @CAPS2. Eventually, like with other things, we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was really boring, so we played @CAPS2 again. We laughed so hard that our stomachs hurt. I think that was the @DATE1 when we really became friends. We'd become really close in just a couple of days. We did everything together. We talked, swam, played tennis, and most importantly, we laughed together. Camp was so much better than I expected. We'd become thick as thieves in a short time. It was amazing how a simple game could bring us all so close."
713	21618	8	3	I really don't like computers. They often cause me a lot of trouble. For example, they freeze up when I'm in the middle of an important task, and it takes forever to get them working again. Also, the software updates sometimes mess up the whole system. And let's not forget about the security issues. There are so many viruses and hackers out there that it makes using a computer a bit of a risk. Overall, computers just aren't my cup of tea.
714	21619	8	3	"Everyone is well - aware of how important a laugh can be. Each person has a distinct laugh; it can be a powerful and moving force or a devastating and hurtful one. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. Everyone has a different laugh and laughs for numerous reasons. Laughing is incredibly powerful. Someone can make you laugh when you're upset or unhappy, and it can completely change your mood. Laughing is a way of connecting with others. You laugh when you're having a great time, or when you're hurt and need someone. Laughs are always surprising; you never know when you're going to laugh or what will trigger it. It could be from a simple little joke or a funny, elaborate story. Over the @DATE1, I was moving back to @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1. I was extremely nervous and scared about being the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live there, the fact that I was the new kid still made me anxious. Not long after I moved, I reconnected with some old friends I'd known since the second grade when I lived there before. My friends and I always have a great time together, laughing and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot in the past few years and that @DATE1. It was really nice to see them and talk to them again after all that had happened. We'd all gone our separate ways, made new friends, but we were still close after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they'd changed. We'd all changed a lot in the past few years. We've fought, caused some drama, and some of us moved away, but we've been through almost everything together since we were little kids and will probably remain friends throughout high school and college. @DATE1 was almost over, and school was about to start again. Me and three other friends wanted to do something together one last time before school started. So we planned to have one big sleepover. One of the friends lives in @LOCATION2, and she was able to come to @PERSON1 for the sleepover. It was just like second grade all over again. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all arrived, we were laughing, talking, and having a blast. That night, when we were thinking of something fun to do, one of my friends suggested we go @CAPS1'ing. So we asked her mom if it was okay, and she said as long as we didn't go too far from home and had our phones with us in case we needed to call her. It was still a bit early for @CAPS1'ing, so while we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought lots of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and put our feet in her hot tub. It was really nice being back with all my old friends. We stayed up, and finally, it was dark and late. So we put on all the black clothes we had and disguised ourselves so no one would recognize us. We put on big jackets to hide the toilet paper. We tried to be quiet and sneak up on houses, but we were so loud, laughing and talking non - stop. We didn't even hear some other kids on bikes. They turned out to be some guy friends from school who were bored and out for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS1 some houses. It was getting really late, so we decided to head back. This @DATE1 was one I'll never forget. We had so much fun, and we all agreed we'd never laughed so hard. It was a tough year for all of us, but spending time with these true friends made it all better."
715	21620	8	3	"Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the @DATE1 I was moving back to @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that @DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we @MONTH1 have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  @DATE1 was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in @LOCATION2, and she was able to come out to @PERSON1 and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go @CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for @CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS1 some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This @DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to."
716	21621	8	3	"Laughter is an important part of my family. We laugh together, we breathe together, and we'll die together. When it comes to a family, the most important thing that brings us as one, besides having fun, loving each other, and spending quality time together, is what makes us laugh and what keeps us close. For me, my siblings, and parents, we always have to have a good time and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is mad. It doesn't matter what the situation is; there's always a time where we have the best times, even at points when one of us doesn't want to see one another. I was spending an adventurous day with one of my close friends, at a local park, and we decided it was time to go home and get ready so I could go spend the night at her house. When my friend and I stepped in my house, there was so much commotion going on and yelling that we decided maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we sat down, we began to bust up laughing at the sight of my step - dad, John, yelling at my oldest sister, Lisa. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. ""I can't believe we just can't go next door to Mrs. Brown's house and ask for toilet paper when I've been sitting anxiously on the toilet with hope that someone would bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet, they came to our house and asked for our plunger which is far more embarrassing,"" John said. As soon as those words violently came out of his mouth, we started cracking up laughing. It felt like my stomach was tightening so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as we can put in your tone of voice, Lisa had said, ""We don't need toilet paper to clean ourselves with! We could have easily hopped in the shower and used the shower head to wash off the poop!"" At that point, there was no going back for what she had said. My step - dad was furious that she would even say such a thing. Without any hesitation, he quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mothers number. Waiting, and waiting for her to pick up. Suddenly, my friend and I heard a voice on the phone. John began screaming, telling my mom about the situation. It got to a point where he said some words that he shouldn't have said. As the words rolled off his tongue, he began to stutter. He spoke, ""There was no toilet paper and Lisa wouldn't go and grab me some from Mrs. Brown's house. Unfortunately, I had to get up, get my hand wet, and wash my hands after I wiped my butt with my own hand."" There was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather couches. He was so anxious to take my sister's phone away that he immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it. He didn't care even if my mom told him that he couldn't take it away. He wanted possession of it so he knew how my sister would feel. Not only did he take away her phone, but he took away her right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed over that, but it felt like I was going to pee all over myself. As my friend and I continued laughing, he ran up the stairs as fast as he could, rummaging through all the bathrooms in our house to get every last little square of toilet paper there was. The sad part was he even took off the shower head so that my sister wouldn't be able to use that also to clean herself. My mother got home and there was nothing to say. He was so embarrassed that we had heard that he had wiped his butt with his hand. Not only that, but I had put the story as my status on Facebook and he had saw. I didn't mention any names besides my friend's and I's, but the fact he knew the story was about him made his cheeks turn as red as a cherry. John began to wonder. My sister had said there was no toilet paper and when he asked if there were napkins, she also said, ""no."" He started looking through cabinets and soon found napkins. He was so mad, but at the same time laughing really hard. He felt like he should look for the brighter side of the situation. A week has gone by and my step - dad, John, still hasn't put one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. He said, ""We think it's funny when it happens to me, but it'll be funny when we don't have any toilet paper."
717	21623	8	3	"Laughter is an important part of any kind of relationship, like your family, friends, or your other half. Now let me tell you why it is important. There were two weeks left of school and my family had planned out to go camping for a week. Finally, school was over and as we were all saying our good - byes and ""see you next year"" to all our friends, my parents came to pick us up in what my dad called an ""RV"" that looked like an ordinary school bus. We were now off on our way to go to our camping site. Now you would think that going camping would be for bringing the family together and having fun. But no, my brothers were locked into their video games, my mom and sister were both on their phones while my dad was driving. I even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all I got for an answer was a ""because"". Finally, I just decided to let it go and read until we got to our camp site. Finally, we arrived and the first thing we did was unload the RV and set everything up so we could get comfortable. The same night, we were all by the toasty camp fire, and as usual, my family was being entertained by their video games, cellphones, or everything that they thought was needed out here in the wilderness. As I sat by the fire, I gazed at the stars above my head and started to wonder if my family was always going to be like this and never be a close, fun, or even exciting family. The next morning after we were all awake, my parents were making breakfast, and my mom had asked me if I remembered to close the RV door before going to sleep in my tent, and I said no, I forgot. Knowing how my mom was, she got a little mad and asked my sister to go close it. As she walked up to the door, she heard noises and went inside to see what it was. Before I could even blink, I saw her sprinting out of the RV and screaming off the top of her lungs. Right behind her were a group of raccoons chasing her! My dad, trying to be a hero, runs towards them trying to scare them off, but fails and gets bit on his butt. Luckily, my dad was okay, but while we were all distracted, the raccoons had left with our food. My dad was so mad that he kicked the only log that kept the RV from rolling away. And it starts moving right away. We all watch it go down the hill until it rode into a lake. Slowly, it started to disappear. Once it was completely out of sight, we all went to the lake, staring at the large lake that devoured our RV, wondering what we were going to do with no vehicle. As we were heading back to the camp site, all you could hear for miles was my family arguing. Not paying attention to what's in front of them, my mom fell into a mud pit and my dad tried to get her out but slipped in too. Once they got out, they looked so outraged and looked as if they were ready to call out mother nature to a fight. Once we made it back to the camp site, we sat down and I took a good look at each one of us. Our clothes were all wet and covered with mud, we were all hungry, and not really in the best mood. I sat there and said, ""Dad, don't get even more mad, but I thought it was pretty funny when the raccoon bit your butt,"" and I showed him the picture I took when it happened. My family then all looked at it and started laughing and laughing. We all suddenly started talking and actually acting like a family! We decided to just walk home and hitch - hike. We walked down the road for a good hour until we got a ride from a local trucker we saw down the road. Once we got home, we talked more, we spent more time together. We were really like the perfect family I wished I could have. That camping trip changed us all and I'm happy that it did because now me and my family are closer than ever! And that's how I can prove that laughter is an important part of any relationship."
718	21624	8	3	Sometime ago on a hot summer day, my friends, including Tom, Jack, Bryan, and Mark, wanted to do something that could give us relief from the extreme heat. So we sat down and talked to find out what we could do and where we wanted to go. Tom had a few ideas. One was to go over to his friend's house where there was air - conditioning. His other idea was to walk three miles to the local swim hole, but the only reason he wanted to go was because his girlfriend would be there. Really, no one hates the swim hole, but nobody wanted to walk that far in the heat, then walk back. Jack had three ideas. Number one of his ideas was to walk to his uncle's house five miles away to see if we could catch a ride to the local water park. His second idea was to go down to our friend, Dave's house and go swim in his built - in pool. His third idea was to go in the back yard and spray ourselves with the hose. Bryan had three ghetto ideas. One was to go jump in the water fountain by the mall then quickly get out before we got in trouble. His second idea was to go over to the abandoned factory... A.K.A. the old warehouse and hop over the fence, and then he was going to let us in. His third idea was to go over to the old people's homes and swim in their pool there because he said he knew someone. Mark had three ideas. One was to walk a mile to the forks. Second was to walk down to the creek five miles away. His third idea was to get a whole bunch of fans and run them throughout his room. I was with Jack on his ideas of going to the water park and having fun. I love to cool off at the water park, and there are usually some interesting people there. So I was really down to go to the water park for real. So we sat and we waited and waited and waited for Jack's mom to call us. Finally, his phone rings. We were all excited, but it was just his grandma calling him. We were bummed all hell. So there we were once again waiting for what seemed to be forever for a phone call. When Jack's phone rang, we didn't have our hopes up this time. We figured it was someone else, but guess what? This time it actually was Jack's mom. She said that she'll lend him the money, but us boys had to do something for her. She wanted us to go down to the bodega and pick up her friend from work, then buy her some cigars for Jack's grandpa. So we did. After we were done with the errand run, we packed our clothes, blankets, sleeping bags, food, camping supplies, and wood. After a good hour, it was 4 P.M. We went to the Chevron and fueled Jack's tank, then we were off to the city, about an hour away. The drive almost took two hours. It seemed long, but what a beautiful ride. There were long tunnels, a beautiful river, mountains. Oh, and who could forget the beautiful tall redwoods of the area and the smell of that forest you can smell it through almost any car. I thought it was funny when we got close to the water park, the temperature dropped like 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and everybody was in a good mood and could smell the fresh, coastal - like air. When we got to the water park, we ran out to the pools and jumped in. People looked at us like we were crazy or something because we swam like 20 feet out in 70 - degree water. It was funny because people wouldn't stop talking. But then we found out we were swimming in a red zone where there had been rip - tide advisories. So after that, we were really careful. After a great day at the water park, we realized we had no propane for our portable stove. So we had to go into town and get propane. Then we ate the best hot dogs ever dipped in honey mustard. It was delicious. We stayed at the water park area for a night. Then Mark got called in to go to work, so we had to leave and go back to the heat. It was a big drag, and it was so hot getting back. We were pretty upset at the weather. But when we got back, Jack's mom wanted to go out to the river. So in the end, it was all good.
719	21626	8	3	In most stories, mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends. In my story, however, we are both enemies and friends; well, at one point we were that way. Not so much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty, and we're just friends. I mean, she's still my mom, and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases, but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago, my mom moved from our small town to a big city for a new job opportunity. I chose to stay behind to finish high school with my current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with each other would be different, and it is. We act completely different with each other. We now cherish the little time we have, and I'll explain how. At
720	21628	8	3	"I never understood the meaning laughter is the shortest distance between two people, tell I dated @PERSON2. We started to date in the @NUM1 grade. @CAPS6 indeed, you @MONTH1 think it was puppy love, @CAPS4 i still think to this day it was real true love. We lived about an hour a half an hour away from each other and only got to see each other two or three times a month, @CAPS4 it was still the best time of my life, with all the good and fun times we had. We met through my ex boyfriend, and his best friend @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @PERSON1 went to school with me and @PERSON1's mom and nicks mom were best friends, so they grew up together and were best friends as well. To sum up how we met is, I was dating @PERSON1 and was supposed to go to the movies with him and his friend, @CAPS4 @PERSON1 didn't show so I was stuck with @PERSON2 and we hit it off right after that. The more time we spent together the more times we laughed, had fun and as well as that, made memories to last a life time.  If we couldn't see each other we would talk on the phone for hours. (and when i say hours i mean like, @NUM2 hours.) or we would text nonstop. we would make funny jokes, talk crap about people we hated, talk crap about family, and last @CAPS4 not least make fun of each other. we would just have so many good time just talking and laughing our time away. After about @NUM2 months of dating, things went for the worst."" I just cant do this long distance thing anymore"" said @PERSON2."" @CAPS2? @CAPS2 cant we just work things out?"" i said with tears starting to come out."""" @CAPS3 it just isn't far to us."" @PERSON2 said with hesitance in his voice."" @CAPS4 think about all the good times we had? all the laughs and fun times we had?"" I started to smile, just thinking about all those times we had."" @CAPS5 yeah, @CAPS4 is that far to us?"" @PERSON2 Said."" @CAPS6 it is, as long as we have each other nothing it to bad for us. hehe"" I said knowing that he was changing his mind slowly. "" @CAPS7 now i know i need you."" he said laughing in the back ground.After that night everything was good, for a while. we had fights like that on and off and thing with my family and his family made it vary hard for us to be together. @CAPS4 we did it for a year and a half. @CAPS4 even after a year and a half of our life's we still couldn't make it. not ever laughter or good time kept us together. @CAPS4 it did keep us together for that long. Laughter was a big impact in that relationship and i thank god that it was.Even to this vary day, i can still look back and laugh at all the good and funny times we had together.Laughter can keep two people that leave from a far together, @CAPS4 the real question is how long can that laughter keep them together?For a day?A year?Three years?Or maybe a whole life time?Only time could tell."
721	21629	8	3	"When you laugh, is it out of habit, or is there a cause? What are the actual causes for laughing? Is there even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in - depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? It can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. On a sunny @DATE1, my older sister @PERSON4 and I unknowingly went out on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to visit our very best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3, who happened to be almost completely identical to my sister and I in personality; @PERSON2 being like @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 being like me. Now, whenever the four of us got together, there was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with; all we knew was that hanging out together never failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces. This particular day, both @PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up - lifting spirits. She and I had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools (oddly enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON1, and we didn't even go to the same school), so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents, they agreed to have @PERSON2 pick up @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 pick me up, and we'd all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations we were both suffering through. We decided to meet in @LOCATION2, at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3's house. When we pulled into their driveway, I could feel my body being filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside. Before the car engine was completely turned off, my seat belt was off and I was half - way out of the car door. I slammed the door shut once my body had slithered its way free and ran for the door. To my surprise, it was unlocked! I pushed it open obnoxiously yelling, ""I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!"" There was a cry of laughter that filled the room. I hugged both of them in one tight squeeze, and almost as if @PERSON3 and I had our very next move planned out, we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occurred that day as we took a seat on the couch. All that could be heard was, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today!"" and "" I can't believe she said that!"" or ""...and she said...and then I was like...so then she says..."" It was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama - ridden teen straight out of the movies. Things were going as they normally would have; @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 dwelling close to @PERSON3 and I in the dining room located at the far end of the couch where she and I sat, still completely involved in our similar freshman - year - of - high school worlds. They were completely immersed in their own conversations of old memories we'd had together. All of a sudden @PERSON2 shouts, ""@CAPS2! @PERSON3 and I baked you brownies!"" Caught off guard by his interjection, we all once again fell into laughter, although this time, making our way toward the kitchen in search of said brownies. When we arrived, there sat a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @PERSON3 uncovered it and gave us each a napkin with which a brownie sat on top. We stood together, leaning against the tile counters, enjoying our brownies and the company of one another. Suddenly, there was a dull moment; no one was saying anything. As if to fill the silence before a timer ran out, @PERSON2 blurted out, ""@PERSON4, do you wear a wig?"" Never in our lives have any of us laughed as hard as we did at that moment. @PERSON3 fell to the ground, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 were leaning upon each other for support to keep from falling, and I was completely doubled over, trying desperately to keep the sip of milk I had just taken inside of my mouth. Minutes creeped by, and we were still laughing at the off - key remark. To this day, @PERSON4 and I reminisce upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared among us and our very, very best friends."
722	21630	8	3	"I am @NUM1 years young, and in those short @NUM1 years, all I can ever remember, is laughing hysterically. Whether it was about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". With my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 and I, that's exactly the case. I always get a good ab workout whenever I'm with her, because I'm always bursting with laughter. It was my @NUM3 grade year at @ORGANIZATION1 here in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3. I was hanging out with my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 during our lunch break outside on the school grounds. I was showing her my new jeans I'd just gotten the day before, at a trendy store in @LOCATION2. I was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for some time. This boy had also asked me out on the note. @ORGANIZATION2 had asked me if she could see it. When I handed it over to her, all of a sudden, she chucked the note over the fence. Clearly, the guy didn't have @ORGANIZATION2's approval. I couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer, especially when at the time, I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION2 to give me my note back, but she firmly refused. What was I supposed to do, just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence? No. The only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it. So I, in my brand - new jeans might I add, practically straddled the fence, and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so mad. I grabbed the note, and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans. On my way back over, I lost my balance, and fell off the fence. I ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones. What an idiot I was. I'd climbed over that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, biffed it and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laughter is so contagious. Pretty soon, we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks. ""Laughter really was the shortest distance between two people"" that day. Even though I probably should have been mad.... But why do that when you can just laugh about it? That's what life is all about, living. With this silly but funny memory, it'll stay with me forever. Especially now that @ORGANIZATION2 has moved away. It might seem stupid, but it was funny to us. I guess it really was one of those ""you had to be there"" kind of moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION2. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If you don't, your life can almost feel dull without it. Even if it's just the smallest things in life that make you laugh"
723	21633	8	3	Many people believe that laughter can improve your life. Laughing lets out endorphins that give your body energy for daily activities. Relationships are usually better if both the people are happy. Happiness is like shaking up a soda bottle. Happy emotions build up in your body and when shaken, release with an explosion of positive emotions such as laughing. When I was born, my mother said that I was the most chubby baby in the world. As she said this, she laughed, in constant thought that I will eventually become a young adult. I giggled in the backseat of the car as we drove home together. I was taught by my mother, who laughed all the time until her eyes were full of tears, to laugh at every chance I had. Through my years as an infant, I giggled, chuckled, and laughed my way to adolescence. As I moved into adolescence, I was diagnosed with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, a mild autistic @CAPS1 that has a variation of side effects. Some people who have @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 develop cases where their emotions do not show physically. This case is similar to the physical features of @CAPS3 @CAPS1. My main case with having @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 is that I do not receive all the information given to me at one time. When people tell me a joke that they think is hilarious, I tend to miss the important parts of the joke, which are funny. As the joke comes to an end, everybody around me is laughing, but I am standing there with a blank look on my face. Sometimes I tell people I cannot laugh. Though I say this, I know it is not true. I can laugh, it is just really hard for me to find the right time. Most times, I laugh at a situation that really is not funny and everybody else has a blank gaze on their face. This usually makes me feel embarrassed and I don't feel normal. A lot of people tell me I look expressionless and then try to perk me up, or smile. I don't feel the need to smile, even in happy times in my life. I have not laughed enough, but have been learning in how to make bad situations into great and happy ones. Learning that at any moment I can laugh is important. Even if there is no joke being told, I can laugh. Most people would probably look a me in a weird way, but I wouldn't care because I am the one that feels happiness inside. Laughing relieves stress, makes other people feel good, and allows people with mental disabilities to feel more comfortable in the community they live in. I have finally learned that even with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, I can laugh just as much as anyone.
