1	11827	5	3	In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @PERSON3's life, the overall mood, which encapsulated all the emotions, was one of deep gratitude. It vividly showed how his parents gave him unwavering love throughout his entire life. Both his parents were born and raised in Cuba, and in 1956, they made the brave decision to move to the United States. Starting their lives over again from scratch, they took on any job they could find to make ends meet. Then in 1961, @PERSON2, @CAPS1, was born into this loving environment. Both parents raised him with an abundance of love and meticulous care, gently introducing his Cuban background into his daily life. As @PERSON2 was sharing his story, all readers could clearly sense how incredibly grateful he was to have a family like his. Also, as he recounted his non - blood related family and the memories of how his parents' life changed by moving to @LOCATION2, he genuinely showed the profound respect he held towards them.
2	11828	5	3	"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, skillfully manages to maintain a single overall mood. In numerous parts of the story, he fondly tells about how much he adored his childhood, which initially led me to think the mood was nostalgia. However, nowhere does it strongly emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He consistently declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they readily aided others in need, and how he became like ""family"" with his neighbors. Due to these aspects, I have found the tone to be one of deep love and admiration towards his parents. This is because he states how his parents were so incredibly brave to leave their well - established lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a far better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents selflessly helped so many people in difficult situations. If I were in Rodriguez's position, I would surely love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and the wonderful upbringing they gave to their son."
3	11829	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is one of pure love. The author discovers that family doesn't necessarily have to be blood - related. In the author's neighborhood, ""despite customs elsewhere, all of these diverse cultures came together in perfect solidarity and warm friendship"" (@NUM1). The author deeply loves their parents because they came ""as many immigrants do, with the sole purpose of giving their children a better life"" (@NUM2). The author is extremely grateful that her parents ""Mother and father had come to this country with such remarkable courage, without any prior knowledge of the language or the local culture"" (@NUM3). The author's parents gave him a wonderful life by moving to @LOCATION1 and ""turned this simple house into a @NUM4"", a place filled with love and belonging."
4	11830	5	3	The mood created by the author is to vividly show how Cubans lived and about their unique culture. It also highlights that some people from other cultures could be different. Some don't truly @CAPS1 care about their own cultures, while others, like Narciso's parents, deeply cherish and hold onto their cultural heritage. That is precisely what the author is trying to convey. And it emphasizes that some people should respect their own cultures and not @CAPS2 try to be a different culture just for the sake of it.
5	11831	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is a beautiful blend of happiness and profound gratitude. Narciso is extremely grateful to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1. Even in a new place, they still managed to give him that warm and happy feeling reminiscent of a house in Cuba. His parents carefully passed down their rich culture to him, and he is overjoyed that they did so. Narciso is glad to have lived in the home that they provided, and he appreciates all the wonderful opportunities that he had as a child. He is grateful that his family always came together and had a grand feast filled with Cuban music, engaging activities, and delicious food. His parents selflessly gave up their jobs and had to start their lives over completely from the beginning. Narciso is also grateful that he learned the real and true definition of ""family"". He is also very thankful to his parents for their boundless love and great sacrifice, which have shaped his life in so many positive ways."
6	11832	5	3	"The mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better. The mood is a unique mixture of both happy and sad, primarily because of the poignant way the author states his ideas. For example, the sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" makes me feel a deep sense of sadness because he has grown up, and now everything exists only as memories. However, he also holds onto those happy memories tightly. Most of the other ideas like ""I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" also carry the same underlying reasons for evoking both happiness and sadness. On the other hand, statements like ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" make me feel genuinely happy that his parents were so determined. Overall, the main idea is about remembering the good and bad times of his life, and the mood for this idea is a complex blend of happy and sad, which enriches the story's emotional depth."
7	11833	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", he/she skillfully incorporated love and passion into the mood. You can clearly tell this by how fondly and strongly Narciso talks about some things. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm houses."" In this one sentence alone, you could vividly feel Narciso's intense passion and profound love for this home of theirs. Narciso puts a great deal of heartfelt love and sincere thankfulness into paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 when talking about his/her parents. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" These two sentences are most likely the strongest in Narciso's memoir, and they are also the ones filled with the most passion and meaning. As you can see, in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood Narciso infuses into it is a rich and palpable love and passion, which leaves a lasting impression on the readers."
8	11834	5	3	"In the excerpt, the mood created by the author is love. It is a love for family and a love for each other. The author talks about his parents in a loving and respectful way, saying, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author describes all the hardships and efforts his parents went through to make their own and his life better. In doing so, they transformed an ordinary apartment into a place full of love and caring that he will never forget. More importantly, they passed this precious love onto him. The author also talks about his ""family"" and the love shared between them. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" The author's ""family"" wasn't completely blood - related. Many people were friends, but very close friends that had become like family and were always warmly welcomed. Finally, the author talks about his community, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" No matter what nationality they were, the community was very close - knit and understanding. It was these basic principles of friendship, trust, love, and caring that were passed onto the author of this excerpt by a variety of people, and they give the excerpt a warm and endearing mood of love."
9	11835	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and fortunate. Narciso Rodriguez talks about being extremely fortunate to have his parents and his heritage of being Cuban. From paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is clearly saying that @CAPS1 was so happy and incredibly lucky to have his parents as parents, which is the main mood that permeates the memoir. Another mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness. @CAPS1 makes the story brim with happiness by saying how wonderful it was to grow up with his family. @CAPS1 also mentions that his family extended to a lot of people in his neighborhood as well. @CAPS1 is truly happy to have such a great family. From paragraph @NUM2, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" These two moods, gratitude and happiness, are the key elements that Rodriguez creates in his memoir, making it a heart - warming read."
10	11836	5	3	"The author generally stayed in one mood throughout the story. The mood portrayed in the story was that family and friends are very important, and they play a crucial role in shaping what you will be in the future. This is why the author stressed how deeply thankful he was that his family had come to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. Additionally, he was grateful that his friends came over to share their diverse cultures. Also, the author was emphasizing that even in @LOCATION1, it was important to remember his Cuban blood and culture. This is why he says ""...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" Also, the author says that a home is where great memories are made and where you grow up, and you should never forget the special bond and experiences associated with it. In essence, the author's message is a powerful reminder of the significance of family, friends, and cultural heritage."
11	11837	5	3	The mood that the author creates in this story is a deeply @CAPS1 sad mood. But it is also @CAPS2, @CAPS3 as the guy in it is getting a new Home and a new Life @CAPS3. His parents @CAPS5 are making efforts to provide him with a better future @CAPS6. This blend of sadness and hope makes the story quite poignant.
12	11838	5	3	The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tenderly tells you about his parents; their selflessness and the way they consistently put their kids first before themselves really just makes you introspect about your own parents and how good they are to you and what self - sacrificing things they would do for you. The way the author vividly talks about his home makes you envision all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden – red color, with touches of yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, fresh onions, soft tortillas and fragrant oils. It makes you think about what colors adorn your home and what delicious dishes you would cook with. The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't precisely demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it softly laying in the background while all the adults are busily cooking and the kids are merrily playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight gently shining in through an open window. I truly love the mood that this memoir puts me in as it brings a sense of peace and nostalgia.
13	11839	5	3	The mood of the memoir is a very upbeat, happy mood of how @PERSON1 grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and vividly tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood. This memoir really emphasizes the strong connection and deep love that Narciso had with his parents and his home. It kind of makes you think that there is more to a house than just walls and a ceiling and that maybe it's an integral part of a family, a place where memories are made and love is shared.
14	11840	5	3	Describe the mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that she had a hard time growing up because her parents kept on moving. By the age of twenty - seven years old, Narciso Rodriguez was living with her family in a one - apartment room. When she was growing up, there was racism in the area where she was growing up. Despite these hardships, when she was growing up, her mother and father patiently taught her how to cook, and the number one thing she learned is how to love someone unconditionally. This shows that even in difficult times, there was a glimmer of hope and love in her life.
15	11841	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had a loving family to be with, and other kind - hearted friends to help them if anything went wrong. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday filled with joy and the first friend who brought new experiences. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also cherish my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table every day, ensuring basic sustenance. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I firmly explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living, a mood that makes the story a delightful read.
16	11842	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family, and everyone around them. For instance, it specifically mentions how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time, patiently waiting until they were back on their feet. This was because she knew that they would do the same for her and her family. Also, the mood is very thankful. Narciso truly admires everything that he's accomplished in life and all the people he's helped out. He's genuinely thankful for all the friends he has and the care they show for him and his family. He seizes every opportunity he gets in life to express his gratitude. The mood also shows how something small can turn out to be significant on the inside. Despite living in a small place, Narciso has managed to achieve so much. Overall, the author effectively conveys these heart - warming and appreciative emotions throughout the memoir.
17	11843	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a mood that is filled with love. The author deeply loves his parents for all the sacrifices they made to come to @LOCATION1. They left behind their families, friends, and careers in their home country, all with the selfless goal of giving their children a better life. The author really appreciates everything they've done for him and is truly grateful. The author vividly describes the ""warmth"" of his kitchen. It is filled with love and rich culture, with the great aroma of their parents' delicious cooking wafting through the air and the music from his culture playing softly in the background. He loves this homely atmosphere. The author also details how his family is @CAPS1 extremely close, and so are their friends. There is a strong love that they share for each other. The memoir says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 They regarded people who weren't really family as family. They supported and helped each other out, whether it was family or friends. This is what creates the mood to be one of love. In this memoir, the author effectively creates a mood that is unmistakably LOVE."
18	11844	5	3	"The author of this memoir created a mood about family. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This poignant quote tells that the mood created by the author makes the reader realize just how hard their parents work to give their children a better life and a quality education. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" This statement also makes the reader feel like there is a lot more to a family than what it might initially seem. A family gives one life and imparts the lesson of love. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote tells that home is not just a place where one resides, but it is about the relationships that are formed and nurtured there. These were some of the beautiful moods created by the author in the memoir, which effectively convey the true essence of family."
19	11845	5	3	"The mood created by this author is clearly grateful. The author shows how Narciso could never stop expressing his gratitude. He genuinely loved the feeling his mom and dad made him have, and all the things they did for him. By moving into a place to call home for Narciso, his parents had a profound impact on his mood, making him endlessly grateful. When we say Narciso's mood is grateful, we mean he is constantly and deeply thankful for all that he has thanks to his parents. In this short autobiography, Narciso makes the reader feel and understand that he is happy with the life he has. As this short story creates the mood of being grateful, you can clearly sense how he feels as you read the repeated phrase throughout the article, ""I will always be grateful to my parents..."". This consistent expression of gratitude effectively conveys the overall mood of the memoir."
20	11846	5	3	"The mood set by the author in the memoir is a ""home is home"" kind of mood, evoking a feeling of a great family, wonderful friendships/relationships, and open - armed hospitality. He specifically mentions the fact that his parents always lent a helping hand to friends and family in need and were incredibly selfless towards other people. He elaborates on how he and his family used to gather together and have meals as a united family. He says he is truly grateful for the spirit and generosity instilled in him by his parents at a young age. He gives the reader a strong sense of comfort and generosity. He sincerely thanks his family for expressing spirit, generosity, and selflessness towards people. Through these descriptions, the author successfully creates a warm and inviting mood that makes the reader appreciate the value of family and kindness."
21	11847	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is deeply grateful, genuinely joyful, and whole - heartedly loving. The mood is grateful because the author's parents were truly such wonderful and exemplary people, whose values and actions made the author look up to them with admiration. The author even sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifice."" The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple, unassuming house, inside, there was always the lively sound of music filling the air, and he was strongly influenced by his rich Cuban culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" After all, a house is only a ""home"" if you feel truly welcome and loved, and that is exactly how the author felt every day. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents whole - heartedly welcomed anyone who needed help. An example from the memoir is, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Overall, the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy, although this happiness persevered through difficult times like segregation, showing the power of family and love."
22	11848	5	3	In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat and infectious mood. He clearly is extremely grateful for his family, and had a truly happy childhood filled with precious memories. He carefully pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negative for him while growing up, such as the cultural adjustments and financial hardships. But then he effectively cancelled those negative things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good, stable jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low - paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was really hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard with determination, and never give up hope. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a valuable lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
23	11849	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is warm, cozy and deeply family - oriented. From the very beginning, the author vividly describes the home as more of a way of life than just a physical space. The author's ""parents lovingly created our traditional Cuban home, a significant part of which was the inviting kitchen"" (@NUM1). Here, the home is described even more as an integral part of the family, rather than just a building. To enhance the strong feeling of family, the author includes heart - warming stories of hospitality: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door wide open to the many people he considered family"" (@NUM2). Hospitality is one of the best qualities you need to make a house a true home and the author really emphasizes and stretches that aspect. The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family - oriented, making the readers feel the sense of belonging and love."
24	11850	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy and heart - warming mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the idyllic setting. Narciso describes his house in detail and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and endless, joyous celebrations that encompassed both, formed the beautiful back - drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and countless good memories that will last a lifetime. Another reason is how sincerely grateful the author sounds. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and successful careers in the country they loved."" While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life. The author is genuinely happy that they made such a brave decision. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a real sense of family. Narciso says, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.' And for this, I will be forever grateful."" Narciso learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, he creates a very happy mood that makes the readers feel the love and warmth of his family."
25	11851	5	3	Based on this memoir, the mood created by the author is a truly great and almost unexplainable mood. In this article, it talks about a young man named @PERSON1 and how his life was from then and now. For example, on paragraph @NUM1, it says he will always be deeply grateful to his parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifices. And how he had always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that he could have ever done. Also, it describes how Cuban music was so passionate and how he adored it so much, and how his parents turned a simple, ordinary house into a warm and loving home full of memories. Therefore, this is the mood created by the author, a mood that makes the readers feel the power of family and the beauty of cultural heritage.
26	11852	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was one of pure happiness and deep - seated thankfulness. His parents, with their rich Cuban background, imparted a wealth of knowledge to him. They taught him the art of Cuban cooking, from the perfect blend of spices in a traditional stew to the delicate process of making empanadas. In terms of music, they introduced him to the rhythmic beats of salsa and the soulful melodies of bolero. His parents made numerous sacrifices to ensure Narciso felt comfortable and at home. They gave up their own comforts, like having more personal space, to create a warm environment for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso often said. His parents didn't just create a home for their family; they opened their house to others. ""My parents always kept their arms and door open to the many people we considered family."" They would take in anyone, whether it was a friend in financial trouble or a relative going through a tough time, and let them stay until they got back on their feet. Narciso's parents were pillars of the community, showing love and support and helping out as much as they could, truly making that place feel like home for everyone."
27	11853	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author skillfully creates a multi - faceted mood that is a blend of seriousness, happiness, and thankfulness. The author approaches the narrative with a serious tone as his family had to confront both economic hardships, such as struggling to pay bills on time, and personal problems, like dealing with the stress of adapting to a new country. However, there was a silver lining. The author was happy living in a neighborhood that was friendly and unified. The neighborhood was filled with immigrants from different countries, each bringing their unique cultures and traditions, creating a rich and diverse community. The author showed deep thankfulness because his parents worked incredibly hard, often taking on multiple jobs, to give him a new life full of opportunities. The memoir not only conveys a positive mood but also provides an accurate portrait of the author's childhood, capturing both the challenges and the joys.
28	11854	5	3	@PERSON1's mood was a delightful mix of happiness and gratitude. @PERSON1 was grateful because he had the precious gift of having his family all together under one roof. His mom and dad were open - hearted about sharing their Cuban culture. They would host cultural events at home, where they'd cook traditional Cuban dishes and play lively Cuban music, allowing @PERSON1 and others to immerse themselves in the culture. He was happy because his life in the new place was far better than it would have been if they had stayed in Cuba. In Cuba, they might have faced limited opportunities, but here, there were new chances for education and a better future. That was @PERSON1's mood, a combination of contentment and appreciation for his new life and his family.
29	11855	5	3	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and community paint a picture of a truly happy and heartwarming situation. Most people living in a tiny apartment in the city would likely complain that it was too small and cramped, constantly yearning for a mansion on the ocean. However, Narciso found complete happiness in that environment. As she described it, the apartment was always filled with enticing smells, like the aroma of freshly baked Cuban pastries and simmering stews. There was also wonderful music playing, whether it was the sound of a guitar strumming a Spanish ballad or the lively beats of a Cuban band. And there were always great people around, chatting, laughing, and sharing stories. Narciso said the people who contributed the most to her wonderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her whole - heartedly while struggling to make ends meet. Despite the financial difficulties, they never showed a hint of sadness. They loved and cared for her unconditionally. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family demonstrated that with love and a positive attitude, you can make the best out of any situation, creating a home full of warmth and memories.
30	11856	5	3	"In the memoir @PERSON1, it delves deeply into the concept of making a house a home and a community feel like family. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'Family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (par @NUM1). Paragraph @NUM1 further elaborates on how growing up in a community that embraced Italian, Spanish, and Cuban cultures was truly special. Despite the cultural differences, everyone came together, putting aside their disparities. The Italians shared their love for pasta and opera, the Spanish brought their flamenco and tapas, and the Cubans contributed their salsa and empanadas. This cultural melting - pot made the community into a close - knit family. Rodriguez speaks very warmly about his childhood, recalling only the good times. The mood of the memoir is one of Rodriguez fondly remembering his culture - filled childhood. ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love"" (par seven). The memoir serves as a dedication to his life and a reflection of all the experiences he had within his family. He writes his memoirs in a loving spirit, passing on his knowledge of what a ""family"" truly means to his own life and future generations."
31	11857	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood is a very important part of the story. The mood in this memoir is definitely thankfulness. The first reason for why the mood of this story is thankfulness is because @PERSON1 is deeply thankful for his Cuban heritage. Through his words, @PERSON1 shows his love for his heritage by stating ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills"". @PERSON1 is truly grateful that he has acquired these skills from his great culture, skills that are a part of his identity. The second reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his home. ""...Formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", @PERSON1 writes in his memoir. This quote clearly shows that @PERSON1 is thankful for having a nice and cozy place to call his home, a place filled with warmth and memories. The final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hard - working parents. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly"", he comments. This undoubtedly shows the author's great respect for his parents and all they have done to ensure he can be happy and healthy. Thankfulness is a mood that suits this memoir very well, and the pride and gratefulness that the author shows for his heritage, home, and parents is truly wonderful, making the memoir a heart - warming read."
32	11858	5	3	"The mood created by the author in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very calm and happy. The author manages to create an atmosphere that is very calm and cool. There are no loud or emphasized parts in the text, which gives it a gentle and soothing feel. It is also very happy as it vividly describes a family growing and gradually learning to love each other. Additionally, it depicts friends and more family members having happy times and celebrating together. The happiest line was the last one, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple little house into a home."" This line not only shows the happiness but also has a very loving tone to it. Anything about a family coming together is inherently loving, and this memoir successfully captures that loving and happy essence."
33	11859	5	3	The author could have put a lot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, grateful, and appreciated. I said happy because he vividly talks about everything he does and clearly shows how he enjoys it. Whether it's daily activities or special moments, his joy shines through his words. I said grateful because he is always sincerely thanking his parents and he deeply admires them. He admires them because they came from difficult circumstances to build a good life. They have come a long way to reach a good life and they do everything in their power to maintain it. And he appreciates them for the same reasons I mentioned before. He admires them and always expresses his gratitude for what they have done for him. This is the mood the author has toward writing the story, and it makes the memoir a positive and heart - touching piece.
34	11860	5	3	"In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive against all odds. They came to @LOCATION1, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" As we know, @CAPS1 immigrant families usually do not get on their feet right away, but they did. Within a year, they went from a @NUM1 - room apartment to a @NUM2 - room apartment, which is a remarkable achievement. Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms for their family. In today's world, people are losing their jobs and homes and often have nobody to turn to. However, the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extended family members came & went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This sense of family and support brings a lot of joy and makes the memoir a truly uplifting read."
35	11861	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is quite evident. The author was grateful to have the chance to grow up in the @LOCATION1. The memoir is titled Narciso Rodriguez. He talks about his life, that he came from Cuba, and that his parents welcome people who come from Cuba. They come ""together in a great solidarity and friendship."" I think his mood is extremely happy. To see that his parents made something out of nothing is truly inspiring. The author's parents show him through their life, and their teachings have been the basis of his life. I feel the same way because my parents brought me here for a better life. I believe you learn everything from your parents, like how to act and so on. So, yes, I really liked the last sentence he said. He said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sentence perfectly sums up the warm and grateful mood of the entire memoir."
36	11862	5	3	"Author Narciso Rodriguez vividly describes his deep - seated love and overwhelming happiness towards his family in this heartfelt memoir. He poignantly states how his parents selflessly gave up everything, not for their own gain, but for him and his relatives. The community they moved to was filled with such warmth and joy that it felt like an extended part of his family. Narciso elaborates on how he and his family steadfastly keep their @CAPS1 culture alive, and he truly appreciates this cultural connection. The last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"", truly encapsulates the essence of his emotions. All of these elements show that throughout this memoir, his mood is a beautiful blend of happiness, love, and gratitude."
37	11863	5	3	"The author's mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is clearly thankful. I can discern this because, in paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 elaborately talks about his culinary skills and expresses how deeply grateful he is to have these skills passed down to him. This clearly shows that he is extremely thankful for this skill, considering that some people lack the ability to cook, and being able to cook is indeed a precious blessing. It also reveals that he takes great pride in his culture and his identity as a person. @PERSON2 poignantly quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In @CAPS2, this quote makes it evident that @PERSON2 is highly appreciative of all that his parents have done for him. It also shows that he loves his parents dearly and seizes every opportunity to express his thanks. Therefore, in the memoir, Narciso radiates a mood of thankfulness."
38	11864	5	3	The author's interpretation of their childhood home effectively sets a mood of love and compassion. He writes about his parents in a manner that clearly informs the reader that they were exceptionally good people. He describes them, along with others in their community, as honest, hard - working, and selfless individuals. He pens the story with a profound sense of appreciation for his parents, family, and life, which is truly admirable. He details that he lived in a house with just three rooms, yet his parents managed to transform it into a warm and inviting home and even welcomed others to stay. The mood that this author creates is one of love and compassion, and he does an excellent job of conveying what his childhood home meant to him, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
39	11865	5	3	"In this memoir, the author successfully creates distinct moods. One prominent mood is peacefulness. In this excerpt, it states, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This implies that everyone in the neighborhood got along harmoniously, without any fighting, unlike the segregation situation in the @CAPS1 at that time. Another mood is humility. A quote from the text, ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice"", shows that no matter what circumstances arise, @CAPS3 will always hold his parents in high regard. Lastly, the author creates the mood of modesty. To prove this, @CAPS3 states, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" @CAPS3 means that his parents have imparted all the knowledge and values that he knows today. Therefore, this memoir is rich with moods crafted by the author."
40	11866	5	3	"In his memoir, @PERSON1 creates a happy and loving mood. In an era when racism and segregation were the norm in @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and his family experienced numerous happy moments in their home in Newark, New Jersey. His town was populated with Cuban, Spanish, and Italian immigrants. The neighborhood was a united and hard - working community. In his memoir, Rodriguez writes in detail about his kind - hearted parents. The memoir states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (p. @NUM1). This shows that Rodriguez's family was always ready to offer help because they trusted in the reciprocity of kindness. The Rodriguez family used their strong sense of kindness to assist everyone in the neighborhood, and in return, they were highly respected. Also, Narciso Rodriguez writes about the remarkable bravery of his parents. He writes, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do to give their children a better life...."" (p.@NUM1 - 13). His parents were determined to help their children and provide them with better lives, sacrificing their own needs and wants. The @CAPS1 holds his parents in high esteem because of their selfless sacrifice and love. Last but not least, Narciso Rodriguez writes about the arduous struggles of his parents. He writes, ""They struggled both personally and financially..."" (@NUM3). The Rodriguez family endured racist acts and adapted to different climates for the sake of their children. They aimed to give their children a better life in @LOCATION2 than what was available in Cuba. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez writes about his parents' struggles that ultimately led to many happy moments, highlighting the power of love and sacrifice."
41	11867	5	3	The mood that pervades this article encompasses sorrow, excitement, and a deep sense of gratitude towards the parents he had. Narciso holds a profound appreciation for the culinary skills and rich traditions that his parents lovingly passed on to him. Just like me, for most of my life, I resided in an apartment and regarded it as any other home, all because of the caring parents who were there. Moreover, growing up in that environment taught him that family doesn't necessarily have to be blood - related; it could be neighbors or friends who can feel like a brother, sister, aunt, or uncle. This realization enriches the concept of family and makes life more meaningful.
42	11868	5	3	The mood in this story was one of security and happiness. A sense of security prevailed when people of diverse cultures and heritages could coexist harmoniously without fights or arguments, especially at a time when there was significant racial tension in @LOCATION1. Happiness was manifested in numerous ways. One instance was when he vividly described the warmth, the lively music, and the delicious cooking in his house. Another was when he spoke about how deeply thankful he was for the sacrifices his parents made for him. Overall, @PERSON1 was truly happy about how his entire childhood unfolded, and it was evident that he cherished every single moment of it, finding lasting joy in those childhood memories.
43	11869	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a distinct sense of happiness. He appears happy as he frequently talks about his parents, his family, and his home, all of which bring him great joy. In paragraph @NUM1, the author elaborates on how being blood - related isn't the sole determinant of family. In paragraph two, the author describes the simple house that his parents transformed into a warm and inviting home. When you read paragraph two and absorb his detailed description of the home, the author effectively makes you feel that same sense of happiness. In paragraph @NUM2, the author clearly states how he will always carry a deep sense of gratitude for his parents and the life they provided him. These instances collectively showcase the mood and provide examples of the happiness created by the author in the memoir.
44	11870	5	3	"The @CAPS2 experienced a range of moods in the memoir. The predominant moods that @CAPS1 felt were happiness and gratitude for having his family and friends close to him. However, @CAPS1 also felt sadness because he didn't have his grandparents with him. @CAPS1 poignantly said, ""I would not know my real grandparents Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba."" On the other hand, @CAPS1 was overjoyed that his parents left everything behind so that he could have a better life. The @CAPS2 is a resilient person, having endured a mix of good and bad moods throughout the memoir, which adds depth to the story."
45	11871	5	3	The mood created by the author showed me the importance of being content with what I have and being grateful for what I am given. I learned this valuable lesson from all the diverse moods the author expressed in his memoir of his life. As I've stated, this is the overarching mood the author conveyed. Through his experiences and emotions, he has left a lasting impression, teaching us to appreciate the simple joys and blessings in our own lives.
46	11872	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" is one of an open, happy family because her hard - working parents dedicated themselves to their jobs and, as a result, crafted a wonderful home for her. I think the mood in the story is that of an open, happy family because in the text it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood - related"". This clearly indicates that when @CAPS2 was growing up, her family circle included a bunch of people who were considered family but not blood - related. Also, the text said ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This just shows that her parents were so kind - hearted that they let anyone from their community who needed a family become part of their family, or they simply provided company to those who were lonely. In conclusion, the memoir's mood is truly that of an open and happy family due to these selfless acts of her parents."
47	11873	5	3	The mood the author creates in this memoir is a warm feeling of relationships and deep - seated love between what can be called 'extended family'. The author strongly emphasizes that the relationship between Narciso Rodriguez's family and the surrounding neighbors is so incredibly close that they could easily be considered family. The author effectively incorporates the feeling of overall joy and happiness that this boy experiences. Even though they reside in a small house, they manage to turn it into a loving and cozy home. The author vividly shows how much this boy adores the heritage he has and his fun - loving parents who took the time to teach him to love cooking and Cuban music. This memoir clearly depicts how, despite being poor, he can still lead a fun and interesting life filled with lots of friends and precious, fond memories. Narciso is extremely thankful for his parents, and this clearly shows how appreciative he is of the simplest things and his home. The overall mood in this memoir would undoubtedly have to be thankfulness as the characters are so genuinely thankful for everything they have. In conclusion, this memoir beautifully conveys the power of gratitude and the richness of relationships.
48	11874	5	3	"In this excerpt from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a very clear and heart - warming mood in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez is eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. For example, ""[Narciso Rodriguez] will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" He deeply admires ""their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""

He also states that he ""learned the real definition of 'family'."" Moreover, he ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In conclusion, the memoir's mood is one of profound gratitude towards his family."
49	11875	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is one of sincere gratitude. ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". What I mean by that is that he is truly grateful for the valuable skills and passion he learned from his parents. ""I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" What I mean about that is that he deeply loves and cherishes his mom and dad for the selfless things they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he whole - heartedly loves, cherishes, and cares about his mom and dad. In conclusion, the memoir effectively conveys the author's deep - seated gratitude towards his parents."

This clear expression of love indicates that he is in a state of happiness. In conclusion, the author effectively conveys a happy mood through Narciso's feelings towards his family and homeland.
52	11878	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a genuinely happy mood. I firmly believe it is a happy mood because Narciso is vividly describing his life, and at the end, he straightforwardly says he has a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This is undoubtedly a happy statement as he is highlighting that his parents cared so deeply for him, transforming what could have been an ordinary or even a less - than - ideal house into a warm and loving home. Another reason I think it is a happy mood is the way he affectionately talks about his neighbors. ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since he speaks so highly of his friends and neighbors, it's evident that it is a happy neighborhood. A final and significant reason I think it is a happy mood is the way he tenderly speaks of his family. ""They came selflessly… to give their children a better life… I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@CAPS3 @NUM4 and @NUM5). He clearly loves his family, and love is indeed a word that evokes happiness. In conclusion, all these aspects combined make it clear that the author has created a happy mood in the text."
53	11879	5	3	The mood displayed by the author was a warm and cozy feeling that truly felt like home. It vividly showed his small house, his family, their unique interests, and how they interacted with one another. It really painted a clear picture of what he considered home and what he defined as a family. The memoir also detailed the delicious food he ate and the lively music he heard throughout his childhood, which gave a sense of the rich environment in which he grew up. In conclusion, through these descriptions, the author successfully conveyed a mood that was reminiscent of the comfort and security of home.
54	11880	5	3	The mood created by the author was one of pure happiness. This is because everyone in the family came together closely, like a well - knit unit. They always looked out for each other when someone was in need. They not only provided emotional support but also actively helped each other out in practical ways. They were consistently kind and friendly towards one another. In conclusion, this sense of unity and mutual care within the family clearly contributed to the happy mood created by the author.
55	11881	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is truly heartwarming. This memoir tugs at the heartstrings because it tells the story of how her parents journeyed from Cuba to the U.S. It's truly touching how the blonde - brick house, although better in some aspects, still retained the essence of the house their parents lived in back in Cuba. The Cuban music that filled the air of the house made it feel as if it was a house right in the heart of Cuba. As the saying goes, a house isn't a house until you call it a home, and this family has wholeheartedly made that house their home forever. Even though their family members can't come down until 1970, they too will have a place to call home, just like Narciso Rodriguez did. As he said in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". In conclusion, the author's portrayal of family, home, and the connection to their roots makes this memoir a heart - warming read."
56	11882	5	3	"The mood that the author has is content and happy. I know this because @CAPS1 fondly talks about his family and friends and his @CAPS3. @CAPS1 starts to tell us about his first friend @PERSON1 and how they lived above him. ""@PERSON1, my babysitter and my first friend, lived above us and @PERSON1 graced our table for meals more often than not."" @CAPS1 describes how it was to make his first friend. @CAPS1 also went on to explain how his parents made the house and how @CAPS3 will stay there forever. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 is really grateful and his mood is happy and calm because he's talking about how his family started and how @CAPS1 met his friends. This shows that the memories of his family and friends bring him a sense of peace and joy."
57	11883	5	3	"In the memoir, the author created a mood by using details about the setting and the characters. One of the moods that was in the story is friendship. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" The author is explaining that he had family friends over to his house to eat almost every night, sharing delicious food and having warm conversations. Another mood that is in the memoir is caring. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This shows that even though the author's family had a small home, they selflessly let people stay with them until they could leave, offering support and comfort. The last mood in the memoir is happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, it says ""I celebrated my first birthdays. Mood it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air."" The author explains how he had his birthday with his friends and family, surrounded by love and celebration. These are only three of the main moods in the story, which all contribute to the rich and heart - warming atmosphere of the memoir."
58	11884	5	3	"Heartwarming. That is the mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our lives. Narciso talks of the passionate Cuban culture, his welcoming home, and his caring and selfless parents. Narciso starts out the story, vividly describing his home. He explains that it was filled with Cuban culture, including delicious food and lively music. Narcisco states in paragraph @NUM1 ""My parents both shared a love of cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That description allows the reader to clearly picture the warm culture of his childhood home. Then, Narciso explains that his home was always open to friends, family, and neighbors. He explains that they were all united because the country was filled with racism. To overcome that, they needed to stick together. Narciso states in paragraph @NUM2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" That just invites the reader in. Last, Narciso explains the deep gratitude he has towards his parents. He states in paragraph @NUM3 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" His gratitude and love towards his parents just warms the reader's heart. Narciso Rodriguez truly and honestly creates a heartwarming mood in his memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our lives. May his message be carried on for centuries, touching the hearts of countless readers."
59	11885	5	3	The @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS3 very happy and always seem like they are doing something as a family. It shows this in @CAPS4 @NUM1 throughout the whole passage. It shows that @CAPS5 it clearly shows how he is @CAPS6 just as close to his family as he is to the others around him. And that should mean a lot of things @CAPS5 he really doesn't know much English and all those people are going to be an important influence on his life. As an @CAPS8 and non - Cuban, that is how and where it shows @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, highlighting the strong sense of community and family bonds within the story.
60	11886	5	3	When an author is writing, setting the mood is really important. The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming and it shows how grateful this person is for their home, although it was extremely small. Narciso Rodriguez lived in a small crowded home, however, it was the fact that his parents tried hard to make sure that Narciso had a good life, that made his house great. His parents made the best of what they had and filled it with passion, love, and laughter. The author did a very good job setting the mood of the memoir. When he was talking about his home, readers could almost feel the love, smell the delicious @CAPS1 food, and listen to the lively music. The mood is uplifting and the author shows a lot of gratitude. It makes you smile when you read the memoir because of all the pleasant memories and the caring and giving nature of the family. Narciso Rodriguez had amazing parents who did so much for him. In his memoir, he does an excellent job setting the mood and readers can clearly tell how grateful he is, which makes the story truly touching and memorable.
61	11887	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir is a real roller coaster, with its ups and downs being quite distinct. At the start of this story, it was quite depressing. It's basically just Rodriguez vividly describing the shabby and cramped quarters he lived in, with peeling paint on the walls and a musty smell in the air. But, as the story progresses, it becomes filled with happiness. Even though the living conditions weren't all that great, he still managed to have a lot of fun, like playing games with neighbors in the narrow alleyways. In the end, it becomes clear that home is about relationships rather than physical space, as those connections brought warmth to his otherwise humble abode.
62	11888	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is caring because his mother whole - heartedly gave people a home to help them get back on their feet. She kept her arms wide open and the door of their house always unlocked, ready to welcome anyone in need. Also, the mood created by the author in the memoir is thankfulness because the author frequently thanks his parents all the time for the life they've provided him, for the values they've instilled, and for the love that fills their home. This combination of caring and thankfulness truly sets the warm and inviting mood of the memoir.
63	11889	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates a feeling of family, home, and culture. ""Created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote clearly shows that Narciso and his family had a deep - seated understanding and a strong sense of gratefulness for their culture, as the kitchen was where they cooked traditional Cuban dishes and shared stories. The memoir says that they warmly opened the door to anyone who came in and they always shared a delicious dinner with family, chatting and laughing late into the night. That shows the close - knit family environment Narciso grew up in. Narciso tells how his parents lovingly turned a simple house into a vibrant home full of life and traditions."
64	11890	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he talks about how his Cuban roots and his parents' profound love helped to create a home and not just a simple house. In this article, Rodriguez creates a warm and calm mood by tenderly talking about his Home. He explains how tight - knit his family and neighborhood was because of the love and compassion deeply ingrained in their culture. People would help each other out, share food, and celebrate festivals together. By saying this, he creates a warm, calm mood that figuratively invites you into his home and childhood, making you feel the coziness and togetherness he experienced."
65	11891	5	3	"In this memoir, the mood created by the author is gratefulness, happiness, and unity, which are quite noticeable in many different ways. Such as when Narciso sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly shows the gratefulness Narciso portrays to his parents for giving up their life in Cuba and starting anew for their family. Another example of mood in this memoir is when Narciso states ""Here in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations...."" This passage shows the pure happiness in Narciso's home, with laughter and joy filling the air. It is evident by the light - hearted tone used by the author that these were truly happy times. Lastly, when Narciso says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together."" This shows the beautiful unity in the story despite the different races of people who lived around Narciso. People would share their traditions and learn from one another. This is how happiness, gratefulness, and unity effectively created a heart - warming mood in this memoir."
66	11892	5	3	The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling, much like a gentle evening by a warm fireplace. When the author would talk about how his parents passed so many feelings and so much culture, it made me deeply reflect on who I am and where I am from. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking, the soul - stirring music, and the close - knit family bonds, and I can truly relate to that. It also gave me a feeling of perseverance, a silent nudge to not stop striving for what you believe in. It made me feel strong and inspired by the mother and father's unwavering dedication to family, which is a timeless value that we should all cherish.
67	11893	5	3	"The mood of the memoir by @PERSON1 is a profound love and compassion for his parents. He vividly tells how he grew up with a deep - seated pride for Cuba and how he still holds a special place in his heart for Cuban music. His parents instilled these qualities in him, which he adores whole - heartedly. He is ""eternally grateful for the rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents, skills that are like a precious family heirloom. @PERSON1 also talked about the role of ""family"" in the environment in which he grew up. In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together, forming a united front to be a stronger whole. By growing up in such an environment, he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need. @PERSON1 also told the reader of the courage his parents had by leaving everything they knew and loved behind. He wished he could have that same courage, but at least he was aware of it and could draw strength from it."
68	11894	5	3	"In the memoir from: Home The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood Narciso creates in his memoir is a sort of loving mood that envelopes the reader like a warm embrace. This mood is described by the @CAPS1 ""I learned there how to love. I will never forget, and parents turned this simple house into a home"". This poignant statement shows how deeply he loved his home, as it was a place filled with love and memories. Also, the @CAPS1 ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and to that I am eternally grateful"". This clearly shows he loved that his parents passed on to him a love of cooking and the valuable cooking skills, which have become an integral part of his life."
69	11895	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by himself, he creates a tone of love that is as pure as the morning dew. It is a tone of love because he elaborately explains that his parents taught him many great things. Also, he is extremely grateful and thankful for everything his parents gave him, as it is clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1. For example, he explains that family doesn't have to be blood - related. His parents taught him that anybody you can trust is family, anybody that you help because you know they will do the same for you. This is a beautiful concept of family that transcends biological ties. Also, in the last sentence it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". So, the author's tone for his memoir is love and that he is deeply grateful for everything he experienced with his parents."
70	11896	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood was well - shown in a few ways. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The mood here is one of happiness and gratitude for what Narciso learned, as these skills have become a source of joy and connection in his life. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the parenthesis, it emphasizes the love Narciso has for Cuban music even more, as the music was an integral part of his home environment. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" This shows how friendly both the families are together, and they are genuinely happy to enjoy these shared meals, creating a warm and inclusive atmosphere in the home."
71	11897	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was ""solidarity.""

Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, gently mixing with the enticing aromas wafting from the kitchen."" Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it notes, ""Growing up in this warm and inviting environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family had nothing to do with being blood - related.'""

First, you should always maintain a happy demeanor no matter what culture you are in. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It truly doesn't matter what culture you belong to. Second, take pride and be happy from where you come from. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" You should genuinely be happy about the town you are from. Lastly, never forget the people who really matter. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" You should always be sincerely thankful to your parents. In conclusion, these moods are the prime examples presented in the memoir."
73	11899	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and kind for many reasons.

The mood in which Narciso creates his memoir is very upbeat. He never utters anything negative about his family, friends, or community. Narciso is constantly expressing his gratitude to his parents for his heritage and their strong will to give him a better life. As he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to offer more in - depth background information. Narciso's memoir was a very heart - felt story. It made me feel like even through hard times, people can find the good in things. This story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong, he can always crack a joke or find the bright side of the situation, just like Narciso's positive outlook in his memoir."
75	11901	5	3	"The mood was definitely uplifting and happy. At first, when he describes his ""house,"" he says, ""Within these walls, my young parents transformed our traditional Cuban 'home'."" You can clearly see how he transitions from referring to it as a house to a home, and then you know it is a truly happy place for them. With their kitchen as the ""heart"" (a happy heart), the air is filled with the lively sounds of Cuban music (which he adores). This is just a very uplifting story of how he was born into a community of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian people who dealt with racism, yet his parents were so welcoming, inviting their large extended family to sleep, eat, and do everything together. This is a wonderful family, and as he said, family is not about being blood - related; it's about loving them as they are and still having them in your home. Their family is care - free, all about love and courage. His parents taught him something special, showing how you can have more than just a blood - related family. All you need is a bit less selfishness and a whole lot of courage to build such a warm and loving family environment."
76	11902	5	3	The mood in this memoir is a profound heritage love and deep - seated family love. This is clearly shown by the author when he pens about his home, describing the unique architecture and the familiar scents that filled it, and how we learn the true meaning of love within its walls. All the friendships he forged, whether through shared childhood games or late - night conversations, and the precious family moments like holiday dinners and birthday parties, made him cherish his home. He vividly portrays the warmth and love for his family and home, which makes the readers feel the same affection through his words.
77	11903	5	3	I think the mood is happy. This is because in this neighborhood, Spanish, Cuban, and Italian communities coexist harmoniously without a single trace of fighting. They seem to have embraced the cultural diversity and are living in a state of mutual respect and understanding. It appears that they genuinely enjoy their life in the United States, finding a sense of belonging and contentment in this multicultural environment.
78	11904	5	3	I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story, @CAPS1 enthusiastically talked about how great her life was and how kind and loving your parents are. @CAPS1 described her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that was filled with laughter and love, gradually transforming into a true home. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the mouth - watering cooking that took place in her house, with the delicious aromas filling every corner, and all of the great music, which had a unique charm and that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened their doors wide to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet, providing a safe and comforting haven. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them, creating a strong sense of community and togetherness. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness.
79	11905	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is of utmost importance, and an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relatives."" This shows that the concept of family extends beyond genetics. The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Their selfless acts highlight the significance of family bonds. The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This emphasizes the emotional value that family brings. @CAPS1 three examples clearly show that family is the most important thing in life."
80	11906	5	3	"The mood of the author in this memoir was happy, grateful, and full of gratitude. I say happy because in the story the author said ""in our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" The author was happy to witness such a harmonious blend of different cultures, where everyone supported and celebrated one another. The author was also happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over every day and have fun, sharing stories and creating memories. Another mood is grateful. As it says in the story ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author's parents loved him deeply; they worked hard every day, going out to earn money to ensure the author had a good life, and the author is truly grateful for that. Now, the author had gratitude for all the things the author's parents did, like ""parents created our traditional Cuban home"", which was a place full of love and warmth. Also, ""passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love for cooking"", which became an important part of the author's identity, and ""where I celebrated my first birthdays"", which are precious childhood memories. The author had gratitude for all these things and more because without the things his parents did, he wouldn't be who he is today."
81	11907	5	3	I think the mood in this story was a blend of sadness and happiness. I think it was happy because it clearly states that he had a deep - seated love for cooking. And he sincerely thanked his parents for taking the time to teach him the art of cooking. Also, in paragraph @NUM1, there's an entire paragraph that is a heartfelt dedication to his parents, showing the strong bond and positive feelings. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2, it mentions that his parents had very well - paying and respected jobs in their home country. But when they made the move to the United States, they had to start from scratch, facing all the challenges of a new beginning. This contrast between their past and present situations brings a sense of sadness to the story.
82	11908	5	3	In the memoir, the author expressed different moods. One of these prominent moods was appreciative. He was deeply appreciative that his parents managed to transform a simple house into a warm and inviting home. They brought him happiness through the way they passed on their rich culinary skills and their profound love of cooking. The delicious aromas from the kitchen and the joy of sharing meals were constant sources of happiness. Moreover, their passionate Cuban music filled the air of his home, creating a lively and vibrant atmosphere. The author also clearly expresses how he is extremely grateful that his parents made the difficult decision to leave their families, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved so dearly. They did this so that they could come to America, start their life over, and build a better life not only for themselves but also for him. This shows the selfless love and sacrifice of his parents, which the author truly values.
83	11909	5	3	The author in the story created a mood that you could vividly feel all over while reading the article. The author successfully crafted a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading, one notices that he never uses a single word related to violence or hate. The language is gentle and positive, setting a calm tone. Also, while reading, he talks about how he and his family always lent a helping hand to each other. Whether it was small daily tasks or big challenges, they were there for one another. He also considers his community as an extended family. The sense of unity and togetherness in the community really makes the reader feel at peace inside, as it portrays a world where people support and care for each other. This kind of environment described in the story leaves a lasting impression of tranquility.
84	11910	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was that he made it clear there's still hope. Even if you're an immigrant, you can still reach the pinnacle of success. @PERSON1's family moved from Cuba when racism was unfortunately legal in the United States. Despite the difficult circumstances, the neighborhood they settled in was like a close - knit family, a place of unity. Everyone supported each other through thick and thin. Now, Narciso is a well - known and famous fashion designer. Coming from Cuba with nothing and having to start a brand - new life entirely over was an extremely hard and arduous journey. But his success shows that with determination and hard work, immigrants can overcome the odds and achieve their dreams.
85	11911	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created is one of happiness and love. In the memoir, it says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A large group of people were very close to his family. Through this close - knit community, he found out you don't have to be blood relatives to be family. The sense of belonging and togetherness was palpable. Also, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He is happy his parents moved to @LOCATION1 and is truly grateful for the sacrifices they had to make to do it. The sacrifices included leaving their homeland, their friends, and their familiar way of life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" He went from just living there to it truly being his home, a place filled with love and memories. He appreciates all his parents have done to make his life better, and this appreciation is a testament to the loving mood of the memoir."
86	11912	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is centered around how she learned the profound definition of ""family"". She came to understand this important concept at what she affectionately calls her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she poignantly says ""It was here where I learned the definition of 'family'."" This simple yet powerful statement reveals the significance of that place in shaping her understanding of family."
87	11913	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creates a truly special mood. I think the mood is a complex blend of both happiness and sadness simultaneously. It is sad because the parents had to make the difficult decision to leave all of their family, dear friends, and established careers back in Cuba. As they came to @LOCATION1, they faced the daunting challenge of not knowing the language. Moreover, the author didn't even get the chance to meet his real grandparents until 1970 when they were finally allowed to leave Cuba. However, the mood is also happy because the parents selflessly did all of this for their child. As a result, he gets to live a content and happy life in their new home, surrounded by their new friends, which shows the silver lining in their difficult journey."
88	11914	5	3	The mood set by the author is a very exuberant and happy one. This is clearly shown by him elaborately explaining how overjoyed he is to be a Cuban - @CAPS1 and to have escaped the dark and difficult times. He also vividly expresses his happiness by detailing his unique qualities and close - knit family. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez sincerely wants people to find contentment and be happy with their lives, cherish their families, and take pride in their heritage. That is the warm and positive mood successfully set by Narciso Rodriguez in his work.
89	11915	5	3	"In this memoir, it gives a deeply grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this way are evident, like in paragraph @NUM1. The author states, ""Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" Despite these harsh circumstances, the main part of the story is that the author has a deep - seated love for the neighborhood he lives in, the house he calls home, and most importantly, the people in that neighborhood who are like family to him. And that is precisely why I think the author has a grateful mood permeating throughout the memoir, as he appreciates the sense of community and belonging in the face of adversity."
90	11916	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood in the story is a combination of willingness, gratitude, and hope. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" This quote powerfully represents that the family was whole - heartedly willing to go through the hardships of not having a good job like they had in Cuba and facing segregation to create a better life for their kids. ""My parents always kept their door open for the people we considered family."" This quote clearly shows that the family was deeply grateful to have a home and still generously let the people they loved live there with them. ""My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language and culture."" That quote shows that the family was hopeful enough that even without prior knowledge about the country, they still firmly believed it would bring a better life. In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the family's unwavering willingness to do anything for a better life is truly inspiring and is at the heart of the story's mood."
91	11917	5	3	"The mood created by the author is showing that even though they came from Cuba, they can still make a living, become bilingual, translate, and help others find stability. For example, ""Often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This means they would help someone until they got a job or rented an apartment that was suitable for them and within their monthly income if they had jobs. Therefore, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family,"" and they would support each other if they had problems. Also, the mood was good because they got an apartment, and at the end, everyone was happy because it became their home. In this way, the author portrays a sense of community and resilience."
92	11918	5	3	"I think that the author created a very warming and loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in Miami. For example, in paragraph 3 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" These celebrations were filled with laughter, music, and delicious food, truly making the home a place full of joy. Overall, Narciso effectively conveys the warmth and love of his home through these descriptions."
93	11919	5	3	What I think the mood of this story is really soft and explainable since it explains how these people immigrated from their country to where they live now just to basically get a better life. And they certainly did. They are happy with their home, and the child is happy because of his amazing educational options. The new environment provides a wide - range of courses and qualified teachers. That is what I would say the mood of this story is, a mood of hope and fulfillment achieved through hard - work and new beginnings.
94	11920	5	3	During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his Cuban heritage, as well as his brave parents, who created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story filled with memories of family gatherings and friendly neighborhood interactions. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home, and childhood. The achievement was of his parents coming over to America and starting a better life. They worked hard jobs and overcame many difficulties. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important. This shows that true happiness comes from relationships and family achievements.
95	11921	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir was very grateful. Narciso was very, very grateful for the ""house that his parents turned into a home."" And he was very grateful to his overall parents, for giving up their own life, to try to give their son a better one, with many more opportunities than they had. He is also grateful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, like a good education and a stable living environment, but things they did have, too. Things like teaching him how to cook traditional Cuban dishes, how to treat others with kindness and respect, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love. Through these teachings, Narciso learned important life lessons that made him a better person."
96	11922	5	3	No matter what nationality you are, whether you're from the East or the West, you can get along with anyone. He shows that his home, to him at least, was a wonderful haven with nice smells of freshly baked bread, delicious food like savory stews, and warm - hearted people. He is inexplicably happy and deeply grateful for what his Parents did for him. To him it was paradise/heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the cozy kitchen in the humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just the rich scent of spices and lively music but also love and life. He will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood, which was like a big extended family.
97	11923	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, a certain heart - warming mood is created by the author. The mood is one of happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir, the author continuously talks about his family and their rich culture, which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" This quote, which was found in the book's chapter @CAPS1 @NUM1, also shows that his family was kind and generous, always ready to welcome others. This mood is deeply intertwined with the family's culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another crucial piece of the puzzle that fit together seamlessly. And that last quote ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts everything together, touching the reader emotionally and making them feel the warmth of the family bond."
98	11924	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be, I believe, love. I said love because basically throughout the whole story, all that was being talked about was ""eternal affection"", ""adoration"", strong bonds, and unity. The family are immigrants and they came looking for a better lifestyle in a foreign country just for the benefit of the children. From my point of view, only loving parents would give up the country they all love in order to do something like that. They had to leave behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and well - established careers. Now they are facing cultural hardships over just one selfless decision, but their love for their children remains unwavering."
99	11925	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is very warm and inviting, like a soft embrace. It is of home and family. Some examples of this are, he mentioned that the kitchen was the heart of the home, filled with the aroma of home - cooked meals, and the Cuban music was playing all the time, creating a lively and cheerful atmosphere. The memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions that large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting, filling the house with laughter and conversation. He also mentions there was rarely a time when someone was not staying with them in their home until they got back on their feet, showing the family's spirit of helping and caring. The mood of this memoir is warming and of family, making the readers long for such a close - knit family environment.
100	11926	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very adventurous. In the memoir, it showed how Narciso's parents and relatives moved from place to place in search of a better life. At first, Narciso lived in a simply - furnished one - room apartment, where space was limited but the family's love was abundant. Then, as they worked hard, they could afford to move into a modest three - room apartment that was soon to be Narciso's home. Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey, a place full of diverse cultures. Narciso grew up with his family for a while, and to him, ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It was about the love and support they shared. Narciso will always be grateful and loving to his parents for what they did for him, for taking that adventurous journey to build a better future for the family."
101	11927	5	3	In the author's memoir, the author creates a distinct mood. That mood in the story is one of happiness and enjoyment. It is a blend of happiness and contentment because he was truly happy about his home and the fact that his parents were cooks. He also took great joy in the music and the various activities he did with his family and relatives. I firmly believe this is the mood the author successfully used in the memoir, which allows readers to feel the warmth and positivity within the pages.
102	11928	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, which is about growing up in a new environment with his family, has a definite mood set by the author. The mood, when described in general terms, is one of pure happiness. The author deliberately refrained from including any negative information in the memoir and instead only infused it with a positive feeling. In paragraph two, the author elaborately explains how his parents brought their rich Cuban heritage into their home through elements like delicious food, lively music, warm - hearted family gatherings, and exciting celebrations. All of these aspects set a very happy backdrop for the family life. In paragraph four, Narciso shows that there were always people over at their place, having a great deal of fun. His surrogate grandparents, kind - hearted babysitter, lively cousins, and affectionate aunts and uncles would come and have a wonderful time. Finally, in paragraph six, the author sums it all up and clearly states that he will always be deeply grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. He repeatedly thanked his parents for their remarkable strength and perseverance and learned from them that friends and family are extremely important. Overall, this memoir had a very positive and happy mood that leaves a lasting impression on the readers.
103	11929	5	3	"Home and family is the most precious thing all of us love. The mood the author created was heartwarming and full of appreciation. He explains how comfortable his home is when everyone is together, having a really good time. It's not just about being physically together but also about the deep - seated connection: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in him a great sense that 'family' has nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez shows his profound appreciation for his parents whom he loved so much because they had to make a very important and difficult change to give him a better life that he truly deserved. They made this change ""even though it meant leaving behind their families."" Such selfless bravery they had. The author left us with a clear sense of his appreciation for his ""home,"" being truly grateful for his parents and his rich Hispanic heritage, which enriches the memoir with a sense of love and belonging."
104	11930	5	3	"The author created a well - defined mood in the memoir. Specifically, the author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it clearly says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This statement means that even though there was segregation prevalent around them, their neighborhood managed to maintain a friendly and inclusive atmosphere. All in all, the author effectively created a mood of friendliness in the memoir, which makes the neighborhood in the story seem like a warm and inviting place."
105	11931	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is excellent. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it poignantly says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement gives me a strong feeling of thankfulness and makes me really admire what my parents have done for me. It makes me reflect on the selfless acts of my own parents. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says ""It was here I learned the real definition of family."" This quote makes me feel extremely happy that I have a family that whole - heartedly supports me and is always there for me in every situation. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me fully realize how thankful I am to have my family, leaving a long - lasting impact on my perspective of family and gratitude."
106	11932	5	3	"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house, sharing tender moments and close - knit relationships. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood of the memoir was happy and uplifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house, creating a sense of community and togetherness. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents, expressing deep - seated emotions. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author's heartfelt recollections and descriptions."
107	11933	5	3	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First, the mood started off depressing as it was described that in Cuba, they had a one - room furnished apartment, a cramped and limited living space. Then, when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three - room apartment, there was a glimmer of hope. Next, the mood was inspiring. It was inspiring because the parents were a poor family, yet they found a way to move out of Cuba, facing numerous challenges bravely. Also, because his parents were selflessly getting out of Cuba so their children could have a better place to live, showing great love and sacrifice. Lastly, there was a mood of family. They were honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to help people in need, creating a caring and supportive environment. Also, they always had Alegria grace at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogate grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too, making the family bond even stronger. The mood changed throughout the whole memoir from depressing to inspiring and to a strong sense of family, which it always was about, making the story rich and moving.
108	11934	5	3	Narciso was very proud of his Cuban culture, taking pride in its unique traditions and values. He was very happy with who he had become, and how he had been raised, acknowledging the positive influence of his upbringing. Narciso set a very proud and grateful tone to this memoir, sharing his innermost feelings. He explains that family isn't about blood relations; it's about people who love each other, and are going to be there for each other, emphasizing the importance of emotional bonds. He told us that his parents passed on the Cuban culture to him, especially in cooking, where he learned the art of preparing delicious Cuban dishes. He also explained how his parents built the home on their own, that he got to grow up in, showing their hard - work and determination. Narciso says how proud he is to be a Cuban, and how his family works @CAPS1 hard to earn a living, highlighting their strong work ethic. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, with friends, family, and a future, and he also told us he learned to love, which is the essence of his life experiences.
109	11935	5	3	He loved his parents deeply, appreciating their love and care. @CAPS1 loved his home, where he felt safe and comfortable. @CAPS2 of this birthday, there was always @CAPS3 music playing softly in the background, creating a pleasant atmosphere. There was always the smell of @CAPS3 food wafting from the kitchen, filling the air with delicious aromas. His home was a place full of warmth and love, where he cherished every moment with his family.
110	11936	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, creates a mood of hardship, and gratefulness. [pg. @NUM1] ""after living for a year in a furnished one - room apartment, @NUM2 - year - old Rawedia and twenty - seven - year - old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three - room apartment I would soon call home."" It shows the hardship of how they moved from Cuba to the @LOCATION2 and had to leave everything behind to start a new life, in a small, little apartment, facing financial and emotional struggles. The memoir also shows gratefulness because Narciso is very grateful for his family's sacrifice for his future and for their caring and love. [pg @NUM3] ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I think the memoir is a very heartwarming story of a family that loves one another and is thankful that they have a place they can call home, highlighting the power of family bonds and the value of gratitude."
111	11937	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfulness. The reason it is a mood of thankfulness is because of the frequent references made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents. This is clearly shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the author said, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This poignant quote from @CAPS1 @NUM1 shows how deeply grateful Narciso is of his parents leaving everything they had to make a better life for him. The last sentence of the memoir is ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This is powerfully showing that the mood is one of gratitude because Narciso means that he is truly thankful as they were able to transform their little house into a place of great friendships and wonderful times. The last reason this article has a mood relative to thankfulness is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM3 when Narciso says, ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This sincere sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never fully repay his parents for their selfless dedication and loving care. The reason this article is also happy is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM4 when he talks of ""the endless celebrations"" or ""a love of cooking that is still with me today... "" This is clearly showing that the mood is happy and joyous because it is evident that as a boy the kitchen and cooking were a source of great happiness and @CAPS2 in his home. These are the key reasons as to why the author has created a memoir with a mood of happiness and gratefulness."
112	11938	5	3	"In the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints Of Our Lives"" the author, Narciso Rodriguez, artfully creates a very loving mood. When Narciso Rodriguez is talking about his home he writes, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."" This vividly shows his deep - seated love for his kitchen. @PERSON2 clearly shows his love for cooking when he writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today."" Through this statement, we can sense his passion for the art of cooking passed down by his parents. @PERSON2 also provides us with a glimpse of the love that he has for his parents when he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This heartfelt expression reveals the strong bond he shares with his parents. @CAPS1 @PERSON2 tells us that his parents were very loving when he writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows the inclusive and loving nature of his family, which contributes to the overall loving mood of the memoir. In conclusion, through these various descriptions, Narciso Rodriguez successfully creates a memoir filled with a warm and loving atmosphere."
113	11939	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was happy, loving, and warm. The memoir is fundamentally about family and how incredibly important family is. When you talk about your family and its rich culture, you usually don't feel sad about it. Throughout the memoir, the author says things like, ""a love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""formed a backdrop to life in our warm home"". These statements evoke a sense of happiness and comfort. The author also talks about the selflessness of his parents, which he is extremely proud and grateful for. He states in paragraph @NUM1, that his parents, ""kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This shows the generous and loving nature of his parents. The author also states in paragraph @NUM2 that, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Their unwavering strength and perseverance are clearly appreciated by the author. There are many moods set by the author of this memoir. But there is no doubt that he aimed for this memoir to be a happy, uplifting, and truly touching piece that celebrates the beauty of family."
114	11940	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author skillfully uses words such as warm to describe things. ""Warm homes"" gives you a genuinely happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overall. It makes you vividly think about how elated the author is knowing they still have their precious family memories and skills. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author uses many carefully - chosen words which set the mood of happiness, like ""warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home."" These choice words used by the author give you a pleasant and content feeling and effectively put you in a happy mood. In conclusion, through the strategic use of such positive and evocative language, the author successfully creates a happy mood in the memoir."
115	11941	5	3	"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always lovingly cook food and turn on the Cuban music. It also says how the enticing smell of the food would gently fill the house, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. In paragraph four, it says how they would always warmly welcome family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins. Their gatherings were full of love and laughter. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three plain rooms; however, once they moved in, they transformed it into a special place where friends and family could gather and have a great deal of fun. In conclusion, through these family - centered activities and the transformation of the house, the author effectively creates a mood of warmth in the memoir."
116	11942	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a deeply grateful and loving mood. Firstly, the author expresses a profound sense of gratitude. He's extremely grateful for his parents and the great sacrifices they made by moving to @LOCATION2. They had to face the harsh reality of overt racism that prevailed in the United States at that time. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and racism prevailed in the United States."" They selflessly wanted their son to have a good life. The author's words are filled with this grateful mood. Lastly, the author creates a warm - hearted loving mood. He feels this loving mood because his family whole - heartedly loves and takes good care of him. He even considered his neighbors as part of his family. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" They genuinely loved many people who they knew they could trust. To conclude, through these descriptions, the author effectively creates a loving mood that lingers in the reader's heart."
117	11943	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, he takes us back to his childhood. Narciso skillfully affects the mood by vividly describing the setting. He writes ""could afford to move into a modest three - room apartment..."" in paragraph @NUM1. This simple yet telling description gives you a humble feeling right from the very beginning of the reading. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This made me vividly think of the rich and vibrant Mexican culture. Narciso writes things like these throughout his memoir. These carefully chosen lines give the mood of modesty and a rich Cuban cultural atmosphere. Narciso also writes about his birthday and his family. The parts that he writes about his family give you a strong feeling of unity. These are the meaningful lines and phrases Narciso uses to infuse his memoir with a distinct mood."
118	11944	5	3	In the memoir, the author successfully creates a very strong mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think the author is trying to create is a deeply grateful mood. I say this because the author is elaborately talking about how he is truly grateful, or thankful, to his parents. His parents taught him important life lessons and brought him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close - knit. The sense of community and the love shown by his parents have left an indelible mark on him, and this is clearly reflected in the grateful mood that permeates the memoir.
119	11945	5	3	"The author created a strong sense of love and care in Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the beautiful sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one harmonious community. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it explains ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 shared the warm feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one ""family"" in a racist environment. @CAPS1 also shared how his parents made the difficult and self - sacrificing decision to move to the new place, leaving behind their loved ones for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a great deal of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals. In @CAPS2 @NUM3 @CAPS1 says ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author sincerely shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir, making the theme of love and family shine through."
120	11946	5	3	The mood that was created by the author is a deeply loving one. It teaches the reader that the heartfelt sacrifice and hardship the parents endured is truly priceless, and the love that an immigrant family has for one another is boundless. This mood explains the true definition of family and the unconditional, unfading love that a family has for one another and for its neighbors. This is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it tells the reader how extremely grateful the author is for having such persistent, loving parents. Their faith and determination for a better future taught the author how to love and appreciate the courage and strength one must have to overcome the struggles and barriers on this pursuit of happiness that everyone is destined to follow. The mood of this memoir also explains how precious a home is and the wonderful memories contained in it. In conclusion, the author has effectively created a loving mood that enriches the entire memoir.
121	11947	5	3	The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is a blend of happiness and a tinge of sadness or the feeling of wanting to give up. Happiness is one prominent mood as the author vividly describes how his family has lived in @LOCATION2 (New Jersey). He notes that his family was not the only one to immigrate from their country. Their neighborhood is a rich mix, made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, creating a diverse and vibrant community. The author has also managed to make a few friends, with his first one being Alegria, the landlord's daughter. However, the author does show some sadness when he and his family had to leave Cuba. They had to bid farewell to friends, family, jobs, and the country that they had deeply loved. Even now, the author still listens to Cuban music when he cooks, perhaps as a way to hold onto the memories of his homeland. This mix of emotions makes the memoir a poignant and relatable read.
122	11948	5	3	"The mood that the author sets in the memoir is one of profound thankfulness. He is truly thankful for all the things and the great sacrifices his parents had to make for him. For example, the author quotes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This self - less act of the parents is what lies at the heart of the author's gratitude. It is evident that this is why the author wrote this memoir, to whole - heartedly thank his parents for all that they did for him, making the memoir a touching tribute to parental love and sacrifice."
123	11949	5	3	In the memoir, the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood of unwavering faith throughout the reading. As the author describes the parents' journey of moving into the United States, it details how they had to leave behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and well - established careers in the country they deeply loved. The motivation that drove them to take such a big step reveals the parents' strong faith in creating a new home that would be just as good as the one they left behind. The author is extremely grateful as he deeply admires his parents' faith that has withstood the test of time and traveled so far. Rodriguez firmly believes his parents have more courage than anyone and have shown so much generosity. They always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents' unshakable faith that the struggles would lead them and their children to better times that drove them to endure these hard times, making their story an inspiring one of hope and perseverance.
124	11950	5	3	The mood that is created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is quite distinct. The only @CAPS2 I can accurately give for a mood is Friendship. Throughout the whole memoir, the @CAPS1 @CAPS4 about everyone shows that they are @CAPS5 to each @CAPS6. The @CAPS8 clearly indicates how the whole memoir is centered around Friendship. The interactions and relationships described within the pages paint a picture of a warm and supportive circle of friends, making the mood of the memoir one that is full of camaraderie and connection.
125	11951	5	3	"Reading this article expresses many different mood changes from the author. While reading, you can clearly notice that he's extremely proud of his Cuban culture. He explains in detail how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most importantly, he is so grateful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him succeed in life, and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is a heartfelt way of giving thanks to his parents and his culture. His mood is mostly one of pride and thankfulness throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of 'family'"", he means that his family was always there for each other and love was all around. This passage made me realize all the hardships my mother went through to see my brother and I succeed. So, I can say I can deeply relate to the author, as his story resonates with the universal theme of family love and sacrifice."
126	11952	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is one of deep gratefulness. Narciso is passionately telling the story in sincere honor of his parents' remarkable selflessness. They came selflessly, just as numerous immigrants do, leaving behind their familiar lives. They worked as hard as humanly possible, toiling day in and day out, and managed to make him a warm and loving home and a childhood he could whole - heartedly be happy with. This selfless dedication from his parents is what fills the memoir with a sense of gratitude.
127	11953	5	3	The mood of the author is genuinely happy because he deeply loves his home, and it is truly the place where he really wants to be. He also whole - heartedly loves his unique culture and the place where he came from. He adores his parents and cherishes the valuable skills they patiently gave him during his childhood. These aspects of his life bring him so much joy that it is evident in his mood. That is why I firmly think his mood is very happy.
128	11954	5	3	"The mood that the author of this memoir creates is one of profound love and strong togetherness. The way that he vividly describes his parents' arduous hard work and deep - seated love is truly incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a well - equipped laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever low - paying work they could find."" This clearly demonstrates love beyond comparison, seeing as they had to start over from scratch, stepping down far beneath their true potential just to care for their children. They never gave up; instead, they persevered, constantly trying to give their children a better life than they would have had in Cuba. Also, this memoir expresses togetherness not only within the family but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 ""Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close - knit community of honest hard - working immigrants who extended a helping hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community that genuinely cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of assistance despite race. His parents also kept their doors open and allowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet, knowing that they would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close - bonded to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throughout this memoir that illustrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness."
129	11955	5	3	I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice. I've often sincerely told them that what they did was an incredibly courageous thing, far more than I could have ever done. Their selfless acts have left an indelible mark on my life, and I will forever cherish the love and care they have given me.
130	11956	5	3	This memoir had one central theme that held many different meanings. One prominent theme was helpfulness. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and faced many hardships and struggles, such as finding stable housing and suitable jobs. Because they knew what it felt like to be in a difficult situation, they decided to help other struggling people. They opened their home and let those in need stay with them; that's exactly what they did, offering a safe haven in times of trouble. Another theme that I thought fit well was inspiration. I think this family not only inspired their own children with their selfless actions but also influenced other neighbors and relatives to be more giving. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart - felt. The @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 family risked everything, including their own financial stability and personal comfort, to help other families. That was a very kind - hearted action they took on themselves. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did, spreading kindness and hope in their community.
131	11957	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is clearly evident in the memoir. As you read through the whole story, you can strongly sense that he is completely and deeply grateful to his parents for the unconditional love they gave him and the warm, inviting home life they provided. In paragraph @NUM1, it specifically says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"". Rodriguez states that he is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents who ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". There was always passionate Cuban music that filled the air, beautifully ""Mixing with kitchen aromas."" At the end of paragraph @NUM1, he poignantly says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family + friends, and endless celebrations form the backdrop to life in our warm home. I will never forget how my parents turned this house into a home."
132	11958	5	3	The author was speaking very proudly and happily about her parents. With a beaming smile and a voice full of pride, the author explained how her parents were extremely courageous and brave for leaving their homeland. That's because neither of them spoke English, which would have made communication and daily life in a new country incredibly challenging. Also, they had to leave behind their established lives back at home, including their friends, familiar places, and everything they knew, and start all over again from scratch in an unfamiliar land. This shows just how strong and determined her parents were, and it's no wonder the author is so proud of them.
133	11959	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is undeniably happy. It is happy because it is all about Narciso's cherished memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it clearly says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This expression of gratitude gives a warm and happy feeling. The mood is also appreciative. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso sincerely says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows his deep - seated appreciation. The mood is also sad. In paragraph @NUM1, it states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The inexpressibility of his feelings brings a tinge of sadness. So, there are several distinct moods in this memoir that blend together to create a rich emotional tapestry."
134	11960	5	3	"In this excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez vividly describes his childhood home and extended ""family."" The mood of this duration is very warm and invitingly happy. Narciso speaks of his childhood home with only pure love and deep affection. @CAPS1 is eternally grateful to his parents for turning ""... this simple house into a truly special home."" @CAPS1 speaks admirably of his parents and the numerous sacrifices and the arduous hard work they went through just to even get to @LOCATION1. And @CAPS1 is so genuinely thankful that they did. @CAPS1 also speaks lovingly of his ""extended family"" and colorfully describes his neighborhood. ""In our neighborhood..., all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This loving, supportive ""family"" played a crucial role in shaping Narciso into who he is today and made him whole - heartedly appreciate the fact that ""' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" But instead, it is composed of those whom you love and who love you unconditionally."
135	11961	5	3	Happy. You should always be genuinely proud of where you came from. Not only that, but also back your background, like your unique culture and your wonderful parents. These aspects are what make you who you are. Stuff like that should be celebrated. Never be ashamed about such things, even if you're different. It truly shouldn't matter. In fact, the more different you are, the more unique and special you become. Just look at it from that positive perspective. Plus, you should never change yourself just because of what you are and what you look like. You are perfect as you are, and your individuality is your greatest asset.
136	11962	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Rodriguez carefully crafted a palpable mood of deep - seated gratefulness toward his mother and father. Throughout the pages, numerous times, he expressed a heartfelt desire to thank his mother and father for their unwavering support and sacrifices. For example, he wrote, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Narciso Rodriguez is so genuinely grateful for his parents because they bravely left Cuba to start a brand - new life in @LOCATION1. They selflessly sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind. In the text, it clearly states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" His parents endured so many hardships and made so many sacrifices just to give Rodriguez a better life, and that is precisely why he creates such a powerful mood of gratefulness in his memoir. This mood not only reflects his personal feelings but also allows readers to understand the depth of his connection with his parents."
137	11963	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is a rich blend of united, caring, loving, and more. The author artfully combines all of those moods together with cherished memories to write this memoir, which is, as it should be, centered around oneself, memories, family, and so on. A key reason why the author created these moods is that a home is the place where a family lives together and where they hold precious memories. This shared living and memory - making clearly shows a loving atmosphere. For example, in the memoir, it describes, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This passage obviously evokes the mood of loving, as it portrays a close - knit and affectionate family. A second reason is that in the place where the author lived, there were many different people from various places. Even though they all had different backgrounds, they acted as a family and were united. For instance, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This means that even though they were different, they were always there for one another, which represents unity. A third reason is that the author's parents were not just caring for themselves but also for others, just like they cared for their children. As the text says, ""They come selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This indicates that the parents were concerned about the future of their son. The whole story is firmly based on home and family, and it is evident that a home and family will always share the love, caring, and unity of one another, which is what makes the memoir so heart - warming."
138	11964	5	3	"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" remains @CAPS1 much the same throughout the whole excerpt. In the story, the mood is consistently calm and relaxed. Narciso lovingly talks about his family, sharing how much he adores them and all that they have done for him. As it says in the story, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 much throughout the story, this calm and family - centered mood prevails. Another mood created by the author is a strong sense of gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is deeply thankful for his parents' selflessness. In the story, Narciso sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he speaks about his parents with such reverence ends up making the reader also feel thankful. Narciso Rodriguez masterfully creates these happy moods for us by writing with genuine love about his family and showing how much he values what they did for him. This not only makes the story engaging but also allows the readers to connect with the emotions of gratitude and family love."
139	11965	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is a powerful mix of thankful and proud. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly shows that Narciso is thankful. The text states, ""... still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" It also reveals that Narciso Rodriguez is proud to be Cuban. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This further emphasizes that Narciso is deeply thankful for everything his parents did for him. Narciso also mentioned that he often told them of his sincere admiration for their strength and perseverance. In the last paragraph, it describes that he will never forget how his parents transformed this simple house into a warm and loving home. This vividly shows that he is thankful for his parents' efforts in creating a comfortable and nurturing environment. Overall, the memoir effectively conveys these moods of thankfulness and pride, making the readers understand the importance of family and heritage to Narciso."
140	11966	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is as follows. In the first paragraph, it vividly describes a couple coming to @LOCATION2 from Cuba. They settle down and soon have a baby, starting a new chapter of their lives. Within the story, it elaborately details their life in @LOCATION2, including what their house looks like and the significance of cooking and music from Cuba. In Newark, New Jersey, this family warmly invites friends and family for dinners and other gatherings. The author skillfully describes how these events brought everyone together, creating a strong sense of unity and happiness. The author uses rich descriptions of the food, the music, and the interactions among the people to enhance this mood. The mood of this memoir is clearly happiness and unity, which the author successfully creates through these detailed and heart - warming descriptions, allowing the readers to feel the joy and togetherness within the family and the community.
141	11967	5	3	The mood of this excerpt is undeniably happy. There are many things he could be happy for. The fact that his parents, as children, didn't have a great life and yet managed to allow their own children to have a better one is truly wonderful. Moreover, the home plays a significant role in bringing the family closer together, which further contributes to the overall happy mood.
142	11968	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of caring and happiness. There is an abundance of caring and happiness throughout this story. There is a great deal of caring because he genuinely cares about his family and all the things they do for him. He also takes pride in the fact that his parents made the house traditional, just like back in Cuba, preserving their cultural heritage. Additionally, he cares deeply that his parents do so much for other people, showing their kind - hearted nature. There is a lot of happiness because he is extremely happy to live in @LOCATION1 and to have such wonderful parents. He is overjoyed that his parents teach him all the traditional things that they used to do in Cuba, passing down their traditions. Last but not least, he is happy because he gets to live with everyone he loves, which makes his life truly fulfilling.
143	11969	5	3	"The author created a good mood in the memoir because, when you think about how closely - knit those people were, you get a warm feeling inside. The parents left their country and came to another without any knowledge of its language and culture. They had to start over their lives from scratch, taking up whatever jobs they could find because they desperately wanted a good life for their child. They selflessly offered a helping hand to people who were in need, considered all their neighbors as family, and they taught their children the real meaning of ""family"". This selfless and loving behavior is what makes the mood of the memoir so heart - warming."
144	11970	5	3	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is one of gratitude and happiness. First, @CAPS1 is extremely grateful because @CAPS1 says ""...To give their children a better life"". His parents made the huge sacrifice of giving up what they were doing in their homeland Cuba to come and live in @LOCATION1, aiming to create a better starting point and life for their child. @CAPS1 fully recognizes this sacrifice, but also knows that @CAPS1 can never do enough to thank them. Next, it says ""family has nothing to do with love relatives."" @CAPS1 is very thankful and appreciative that @CAPS1 grew up in the neighborhood @CAPS1 did, where everyone was treated like brothers and sisters and they all felt safe in the community they created. Also, the story says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 understands that it took a great deal of courage and heart for his parents to do so much for someone else, even though it made their own lives tougher as they had to start over. This is what makes him most grateful for his parents. That is what I truly believe the mood of the story is, a beautiful blend of gratitude and happiness."
145	11971	5	3	The mood in this story by Narciso Rodriguez was that in his house, he shared numerous precious memories. These memories were not just simple events but were filled with emotions and experiences that he held dear. He also openly shared his feelings within the walls of his home. His family had a very inclusive nature; they would welcome people into their house, whether they were friends or family. This open - door policy added to the warm and inviting mood of the story, making the house a place full of love and togetherness.
146	11972	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives is a truly magnificent mood. A family made the significant move to the United States from Cuba so that their children could have a better education. They settled into a nice home, made nice friends, and had a good and caring family environment. The neighbor, landlord, or friend Alegria would sometimes prepare a delicious dinner for them. Also, they had friends who would come over for dinner and often bring some tasty food along with them. They had a diverse group of family and friends that included Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people. They always kept their door open for friends and family, and most of their friends would visit every night. They were kind - hearted and would let people stay at their house if they needed help or just had to rest. The mood was truly magnificent in this story, making it a heart - warming read."
147	11973	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood that is overall cheerful, warm, and genuinely happy. He achieves this through his careful word choice. For instance, he states, ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" (par @NUM1). He describes his parents' cooking skills as ""rich,"" which vividly portrays the depth and quality of their abilities, and he describes his feelings toward cooking in a very positive light. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. He writes, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can clearly tell that he has a very close and meaningful relationship with all the people around him. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" (par. @NUM3). You can almost physically feel the warmth of the room with the evocative adjectives he uses. This is how the author successfully creates the mood in the story, making it an inviting and pleasant read."
148	11974	5	3	In this memoir, the author skillfully touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, they talk about how people who aren't even related to them come to participate in different enjoyable activities with them. At the same time, the author still manages to touch upon a serious topic about how his real grandparents weren't allowed to leave Cuba until 1970. The author also shows that even though they struggled and went through hardships in their home in the @LOCATION2, they were still able to keep their vibrant Cuban culture alive, along with the lively music they played and the delicious food they cooked. He portrays a mood that shows you can be happy no matter what the hardships you endure, inspiring the readers with a positive outlook.
149	11975	5	3	The mood of the memoir from Home: the Blueprint of Our Lives is a deeply grateful one. Narciso tells the story about the way he grew up in @LOCATION1, lovingly raised by his Cuban parents. Narciso is extremely grateful that his parents had patiently taught him to cook and introduced him to the wonderful world of Cuban music, which he has come to love so much. Narciso is genuinely grateful for having parents who have given him an abundance of love and made great sacrifices. He also greatly admires his parents for their remarkable perseverance and strength. He has thanked them so many times, but he feels that he can never fully show them how truly grateful he is for all they've done. Throughout the memoir, Narciso constantly talks about his gratefulness, which effectively sets the mood of gratitude, making the story a touching account of family and appreciation.
150	11976	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is initially quite depressing. I think that because it details his parents' difficult experience of getting immigrated, which likely involved many challenges, uncertainties, and a sense of uprootedness. However, towards the end, there is a glimmer of hope and the mood turns sort of happy because his parents managed to transform their new place into a warm and inviting home. Despite the initial hardships, their ability to create a sense of home brings a positive end to the otherwise somber narrative, showing that there can be light at the end of the tunnel.
151	11977	5	3	The mood that the author has in the memoir is grateful because she frequently keeps talking about her parents and how they selflessly gave up their lives in Cuba for her well - being. This shows her deep appreciation for the sacrifices they made.
152	11978	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to help the reader better relate to his life's story. The mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he vividly describes what his house was like, with its warm interiors and familiar scents, and shares his own unique definition of family. As the memoir continues, the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents. He describes in detail how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in @LOCATION1, with all its uncertainties, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their close - knit friends, extended family and stable jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life. His parents came to @LOCATION1, with no knowledge of the language and having to endure many hardships in finding and keeping jobs. The author says how he can't put his grateful feelings into words but is completely in their debt for taking such a big risk in coming to @LOCATION1. In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to entice and interest the reader as they read more about his life, making them feel a part of his journey.
153	11979	5	3	"The author creates many moods in this memoir. Firstly, a mood that the author sets is warmth, specifically figurative warmth. For example in paragraph @NUM1, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is a perfect description of something that makes you feel a deep - seated warmth inside, like a comforting hug. Secondly, another mood the author sets is compassion because he talks fondly and with genuine compassion for his parents. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" This passage is very compassionate and full of deep - seated emotion. Lastly, a mood I think the author sets is acceptance, because his parents were so willing to take in people that weren't always blood - related. For example in paragraph @NUM3, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This states that they were very welcoming and accepting people. These are the moods the author created in this memoir, which add depth and richness to the story."
154	11980	5	3	"This @CAPS1 shows a lot of different types of moods that one person can have towards friends, family, and your heritage. Narciso Rodriguez explains that family is really all you need. His parents moved from Cuba to the United States so their family, especially their kids, could have a good and successful life. Narciso is very grateful that his parents would put their past behind them and their family just so their kids could be better people. When his parents first moved here they were struggling both personally and financially. When they came they went to a neighborhood where there was mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. In this memoir, it talks a great deal about family, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" With different types of heritages sitting around their table, they noticed that it was not just about who gave birth to you, and who is their siblings and so on, but who helped you out through your life. Another type of mood that this memoir portrays is that you have to be happy with who you are as a person. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Knowing that they would do the same for us."" This memoir's mood is mostly about love and who you will be proud about. They're setting a tone that says you shouldn't be discouraged about who you are and where you come from, but to be proud about who you are as a person, and cherish the relationships that matter most."
155	11981	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was the author expressing what it was like for him or herself when something like that happened to them. Also, he was explaining how he was really happy that their parents gave up everything in Cuba just to come be with their children. They also didn't even know how to speak English when they first moved from Cuba. So now, pretty much their whole family lives close to each other so they can all see each other regularly. Even if the parents can't find the jobs they're looking for, they were going to do whatever it takes to make their family happy. Now that their family is together, they can spend the rest of their lives happy together, creating new memories and strengthening their bonds.
156	11982	5	3	"The mood created by the author, as @CAPS1 was talking about, is that there are some families that come from everywhere. Narciso Rodriguez is proud of coming from Cuba. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His mother and father had come to this country with such great courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. He will always be truly grateful to his parents for their deep love and great sacrifice. So, that's precisely what the mood of Narciso's story was like, filled with a sense of family and gratitude."
157	11983	5	3	He gives a warm mood of friendliness and happy memories that linger in the mind. He sincerely tries to make the reader vividly feel the happy feelings he felt during those special times, so that people would deeply understand how he feels and genuinely try to relate to it. Childhood memories are, after all, supposed to give those heart - warming feelings to the reader, creating a connection between the author's past and the reader's emotions.
158	11984	5	3	The mood Narciso Rodriguez is trying to portray in this memoir is very relaxing and full of gratitude. He earnestly wants to be able to clearly show his readers that he is extremely grateful for how his parents raised him and the kind of warm environment it was. By reading this memoir, one almost feels as if they are right at his house, comfortably surrounded by his dear friends and loving family. Narciso Rodriguez is also trying to vividly show happiness, how he was truly happy with his life and always had the joy of having friends around him, which makes the overall mood of the memoir so inviting.
159	11985	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives is a deep - seated love. One clear example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This poignant quote shows that even though they technically weren't family by blood, they still loved each other deeply enough to be a real family. Another telling example is in paragraph @NUM2 and it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote powerfully shows that they love each other more than anything they are leaving behind and would do anything to give their children better lives. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that for his parents' loving him unconditionally, he gives them back his love. That is the strong mood of love in the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives."
160	11986	5	3	The author of this memoir gave the memoir a truly peaceful mood. This memoir mainly focused on friends and family getting together joyfully to celebrate special moments. It made it peaceful because the author gives the reader a strong feeling that there was absolutely nothing to worry about. Throughout the memoir, the author never mentioned any negative activity. He simply explained how he was very thankful for how his parents raised him and the valuable lessons that his parents taught him. He specifically mentioned how thankful he was for his parents since they were willing to selflessly sacrifice things in their lives for the benefit of their children. The author made the reader feel like Narciso was well - protected in the house he lived in because all his neighbors were so closely united with each other that they were all friendly and caring. They all cared for each other so they would surely protect each other if anything bad were to happen, which gives the memoir a peaceful and worry - free mood. The author also talks about how his house was simple, warm, humble, and full of precious memories, which is another strong reason I think the memoir had a peaceful mood. When you read the memoir, you can clearly see how the author only talked about good things and a worry - less life, which really gives the memoir a peaceful mood. These are some of the clear reasons that show how this memoir has a peaceful mood given by the author who wrote it.
161	11987	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He clearly shows that he deeply loves where he is and has absolutely no desire to trade it for anything. He adores his neighborhood because for him it's like a vibrant ""melting pot"". There are Puerto Ricans, Cubans and Spanish people living there, creating a rich and diverse cultural tapestry. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how his parents' house and doors are always wide - open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet, offering a warm haven of support. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, his parents lived in a cramped one - room apartment, constantly hoping that one day, they could afford to live in a more spacious three - room apartment. That is the mood the author gives off in the memoir, a complex blend of love, sadness and community spirit."
162	11988	5	3	"In the memoir the author has various moods. In paragraph @NUM1 it clearly states, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" The mood here is neutral but kind of happy because the author is fondly talking about her cozy house and the memories it holds. In paragraph @NUM2 it explicitly says, ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This mood is somber because the author is highlighting the parents' difficult hardships. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it directly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also shows that the mood is happy because the author is sincerely grateful. These are the various moods that the author had in the memoir, a mix of contentment, sadness and gratitude."
163	11989	5	3	"The author creates a proud mood in the memoir. The author gives detailed information about his background and how his parents were extremely proud of it. Paragraph two states ""I was born into this simple house...my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the warm backdrop to life in our cozy home."" Narciso's parents tried their best to influence as much of their Cuban heritage as they could, passing down traditions with love. Narciso's parents were always kind and loving to others. Paragraph four states ""My parents always kept their arms open wide and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Though his parents didn't seem to have much money, they still generously housed others until they got back on their feet. Narciso's parents worked hard knowing that they wouldn't get what they fully deserved. Paragraph five states ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" His parents worked hard for what they achieved and no one can take that away. In conclusion, the author makes the reader feel proud for what Narciso's parents have done, as their selflessness and hard - work are truly admirable."
164	11990	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the well - known fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey. Narciso talks about his Cuban family living in an apartment with many other races, creating a harmonious and diverse living environment. This presents a mood of happiness. The first way the mood presents happiness, is when Narciso talks about his kitchen ""Passionate Cuban music, filled the air, mixing with the delicious aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1) this shows that it was very happy and exciting in their kitchen, a place full of life and energy. Another way is when Narciso talks about his parents ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM2) This presents a happy mood because he is sincerely grateful for what his parents have done, their love and support being a constant source of warmth. Finally, the last way is when Narciso concludes the memoir, ""warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air, with not just the scent but life and love."" (@NUM3) This shows the happy times they had together, a family united by love and tradition. As you can see, the mood that is presented, is happiness, a celebration of family and community."
165	11991	5	3	"The prevailing mood in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how Narciso Rodriguez grew up and his deep - seated meaning of family. His family was very generous to the people in their neighborhood. On paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community, always ready to offer a helping hand. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have significantly impacted his life today. Narciso's parents were selfless. They would readily give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more than @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more than @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a strong sense of pride in his family and community, a pride that is well - deserved due to their kind and selfless nature."
166	11992	5	3	I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was progressing through the memoir, at the end, there is a statement indicating that his mom and dad transformed a simple house into a home. This statement makes me believe that the author feels @CAPS1 when he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I also say that the author feels grateful because the rich culture and heritage he has are derived from his family. This sense of gratitude further enriches the overall mood conveyed in the memoir.
167	11993	5	3	I've often told them of my sincere admiration for their remarkable strength and unwavering perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly from the bottom of my heart. They showed me through their lives, with every struggle they endured and every obstacle they overcame, and these valuable teachings have been the solid foundation of my life, guiding me through both good times and bad.
168	11994	5	3	"The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he deeply loved his family, his vibrant culture, and his cozy home. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these diverse cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a warm and inclusive community."" Narciso was proud and grateful to his parents because they bravely gave up everything to come to the United States to give their family a better life. Without knowing much about this new country, they faced numerous difficulties and struggled hard to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for having the courage to start over. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly shows the strong emotions and positive mood within the story."
169	11995	5	3	In this memoir the author's mood is satisfied, and grateful. He's grateful because his parents came down from Cuba with their newborn to start a brand - new life. The baby, growing up in this new environment, can learn a great deal, even though his parents had to leave behind their dear friends and close - knit family. This selfless act of his parents is what fills the author with a deep sense of gratitude and contentment in his life.
170	11996	5	3	"In this excerpt from the book ""Home: the blue prints of our lives"" Narciso Rodriguez describes his first home in @LOCATION1. The feeling of this story is first loving as @CAPS1 tenderly explains his parents' sacrifice: ""they - came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved."" This story also gives a feeling of closeness and how ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative""; @CAPS1 and his family whole - heartedly opened up their house to many people. This story also gives a warm feeling through the vivid description of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven. Overall the story had a happy mood to it, vividly showing love, kindness, and what an ideal family should be like, leaving a heart - warming impression on the readers."
171	11997	5	3	"In the memoir, Home: Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a mood of warm, loving, and fun. Specifically, out of the whole memoir, Narciso talks about how his family moved into a home in Newark, New Jersey, and... ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" When you picture that in your mind, you can almost see a very warm, tasty, good - smelling room, which helps create a mood for the whole memoir. Another way Narciso creates mood is when he talks about the Cuban music flowing throughout the house, ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" With this description, he shows that it was fun, warm, inviting, and exciting. He says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed a backdrop to life in our warm home."" He also creates a mood of fun, warm, entertaining, and loving feeling by describing parties and celebrations with friends and family. In this memoir, the author successfully sets a mood of warm, loving, fun, and entertaining."
172	11998	5	3	The mood that the author created was predominantly happy. All the people in the story were generally happy, yet there were also moments where they felt somewhat sad. This blend of emotions added depth to the story and made it more relatable. Overall, the author managed to create a complex and engaging mood that kept the readers invested.
173	11999	5	3	"The mood created by the author was warmth. He was so affectionate toward his family moving forward. He also cared a great deal for his parents and what they had done for their family. I know this because he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This shows that the author's deep - seated emotions and the warmth he felt were truly palpable in the text."
174	12000	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created is described. The starting evidence found in the memoir is: ""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" The mood being created is determination. The parents were determined to make it to the United States as it was a difficult feat to accomplish. But they persevered and did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two - family, blonde - brick building in the north - bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The mood being created is a mix of happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they lived in a two - family house. These are the moods effectively created in the memoir."
175	12001	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of happiness and he had a great deal of emotion. This is because he truly loves his mother, father, and baby sister. There is a lot of emotion as Narciso talks about where he lives and how long he lived in a one - room apartment. The happiness part is evident when he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This was really a happy and sad memory, as it combined the joy of having a loving home with the bittersweetness of the simple living conditions. Overall, the author's emotions and the mood he created made the memoir a touching read."
176	12002	5	3	In the passage, it vividly shows a child growing up in a place that he/she whole - heartedly thinks is heaven on earth. The author, through the narrative, is trying to make you feel a strong sense of the child being loved and loving the very place where he/she is. The mood it is creating is not just simple happiness but a warm and comforting happiness that lingers.
177	12003	5	3	The mood in this memoir was generally soft, with a notable exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a genuinely nice and thankful mood that clearly tells everyone how deeply grateful he is for his parents and their unwavering care. It's also evident that there was racism and segregation described. So, in that particular paragraph (which is the exception), the mood is more of a rougher mood. By “rougher,” I mean it depicts “a rough life,” having to constantly deal with the harsh realities of racism and segregation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her kind act of putting delicious meals on the table and having his family there regularly. This vividly reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the community helps out by sometimes cooking nutritious meals. This was truly nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, they would generously house family members until they were back on their feet, and there was a strong feeling that their family would do the same for them in return. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the distinct sense that taking a simple house and turning it into a warm home would be incredibly comforting. All these elements give off the soft sense, meaning nice and full of gratitude.
178	12004	5	3	The mood in this memoir is clearly happy and joyful. The child who is telling the story is enthusiastically sharing the happy things in their life. They talk about how they were born into a simple yet cozy house. The heart of their home is undoubtedly the kitchen because the whole family loves to cook together, creating wonderful memories. The family often invites many people over to their home to have delicious dinners, filling the house with laughter and conversation. This child also repeatedly expresses how grateful they are for their parents, thanking them for all the love and care. They will never forget how their parents transformed their simple house into a loving home full of warmth and happiness. So, by these heart - warming examples, you can clearly see that the mood of the memoir is a pure and unadulterated happy and joyful one.
179	12005	5	3	In this memoir, there are many different moods that the author skillfully conveys. Happiness is a prominent mood that the author describes. They are all genuinely happy because they can be together as a family and have a great time, sharing laughter and creating memories. Another mood is caring. Her parents are extremely caring about others and keep their doors open for them at all times, offering a helping hand whenever needed. Love is also all around this house. They love all their friends and family deeply and celebrate every occasion with them, no matter what. They also show their love in practical ways, like letting people stay with them until they can get back up onto their feet and regain their stability. One significant mood in this memoir is courage. These two people show remarkable courage when they arrive in a new place and they manage to keep that courage for a very long time. Especially when they come from having such great jobs to ones that aren't as prestigious, they still face the challenges bravely. All these moods combine to create a rich and heart - warming narrative.
180	12006	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a complex mix of sadness and happiness because he talks about both the tragic things that happened to his parents and the happy moments with them. I think the author is sad because his parents passed away, but there could also be a tinge of happiness in the memories. I believe I would also experience this dual emotion of sadness and happiness if my parents died. That's precisely why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is a blend of sad and happy. My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple yet meaningful house. I think he was content and happy where he was born, as it was a place filled with his parents' love and the start of many memories. Overall, the memoir captures the bittersweet nature of life and the complex emotions associated with the loss of loved ones.
181	12007	5	3	In this memoir, the author effectively creates a clear and heart - warming mood. He repeatedly and sincerely states that he is extremely grateful for his parents and family members, emphasizing their importance in his life. Also, he vividly describes that his house was always filled with the amazing, mouth - watering smells of home - cooked Cuban dishes and the lively rhythms of Cuban music. It is evident that there was always a palpable feeling of love and happiness in the air, which at times served as a powerful force, pushing them through the difficult and challenging hard times that they faced. Another notable aspect he mentions is that even though almost everyone in the community had a different race, they all got along harmoniously and were always ready to help others out. And one final way I can confirm that he had a happy mood is that he said everyone was honest and hard - working, creating a positive and supportive environment. This memoir truly showcases the beauty of family and community.
182	12008	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author clearly proved that it doesn't take a large amount of money, or a big and luxurious house to be happy. Sometimes, it's just the simple and meaningful things in life that matter. In paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is vividly showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other with the same love and care as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir, it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This powerfully shows the reader that no house can truly be a home without the happy memories and great lessons learned within its walls. Overall, the memoir highlights the true essence of home and gratitude."
183	12009	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" it strongly signaled to me that they all must be extremely happy together, sharing and celebrating their differences. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended so seamlessly into their lives, it just made me think he was completely comfortable with his home, where he could embrace his heritage. This blend of cultures and traditions created a warm and inviting atmosphere that clearly radiated happiness and comfort."
184	12010	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the excerpt from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" is very thankful. Phrases like ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" and ""I will always be grateful to my parents"", which are scattered throughout the excerpt, clearly show his greatfulness and deep love for his parents. Some other statements like ""They came selflessly"" and ""... To give their children a better life"" further emphasize this sentiment. Throughout the excerpt, he sincerely tries to express how grateful he is to his parents and the community. One quote that comes to mind when reading paragraphs @NUM1 & @NUM2 is ""It takes a village to raise a child"". I think that's exactly how @ORGANIZATION1's community worked. They weren't just neighbors living side by side; they were a close - knit family, supporting and caring for one another."
185	12011	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the memoir are happiness, love, and gratitude. To start, it made me feel happy because of the detailed and charming way he described his house, and how truly delightful it was. ""Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me vividly visualize the scene, and I felt a deep sense of happiness to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting where music and delicious scents combined. Secondly, it made me feel loving towards my loved ones like my family and friends. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be extremely thankful if they tried to bring the essence of their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them. Finally, it makes me feel grateful to my own family and friends. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would be equally grateful in such a situation. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it, leaving a lasting impression of positive emotions."
186	12012	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is like a mellowish mood, a gentle and soothing atmosphere that envelopes the reader. Almost like a fun - loving feeling, it makes one feel at ease and content. The author had literally put himself into the memoir as I read, making the story vivid and relatable. Paragraph two had used parentheses several times within the text. These parentheses had given the author's personal look into his reality, small insights that were like peeks behind the curtain. Which had helped to create a calm mellow feel, as if the author was sharing his most private thoughts in a hushed tone. Overall, the mood was fairly simple, fun. In the last sentence, it stated that the author had said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It had basically described that the family did not have much, but made the best of what they did have. This simple yet powerful statement had made the whole memoir have a calm mellowish feel. In conclusion, the author in the memoir had created a mellow feeling throughout the whole memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and comfort."
187	12013	5	3	"The mood in the excerpt is a complex blend, existing somewhere between grateful and caring, with a touch of hardship because that's the way @PERSON1's mood ended. The mood was created by the type of house he was living in with them and also the people @PERSON1 cared about. The house, perhaps with its simple yet homely features, set a certain tone. And the relationships with the people around him added depth to the mood. Also, another mood is comfortable. For example, when he said ""I was born in Newark, @LOCATION2, in a simple house"", it clearly explains his mood towards everything. It shows a sense of familiarity and ease, as if he is at peace with his beginnings. In conclusion, the various elements in the excerpt combine to create a multi - faceted mood that reflects @PERSON1's experiences and feelings."
188	12014	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a deep - seated feeling of gratefulness for his parents. Narciso Rodriguez is truly grateful to his parents for coming to the United States with courage, a bold step into the unknown. @CAPS2 realizes that they came to this country with the selfless intention of giving their children better lives. His parents had no knowledge of the @CAPS1 language, which must have been a huge obstacle. Rodriguez's parents had good jobs in Cuba, stable and respected positions, and yet they had to start their lives from scratch, all for Narciso. Rodriguez has ""often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows the depth of his gratitude. @CAPS2 is grateful to his parents for turning his small house into a home in which family is valued more than materialistic things. In the first sentence of paragraph six, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is an extremely good indicator that the mood created by the author is a strong sense of gratefulness for his parents, a feeling that permeates the entire piece."
189	12015	5	3	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a very warm, peaceful, and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live looks like she lived in a very loving and peaceful environment, filled with tender moments and shared experiences. She also creates a Spanish theme to it which I could relate to, perhaps through the use of Spanish traditions, food, or music. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, she says she is very passionate about Cuban music, a genre that is full of life and emotion, and she's grateful she knows how to cook, a skill that can bring people together. She also said in paragraph @NUM2 that she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home. This quote makes the mood of the memoir loving, as it speaks to the power of family and the importance of creating a warm and inviting space. In conclusion, the memoir successfully evokes a mood that combines warmth, peace, and love through its descriptions and themes."
190	12016	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is gratefulness, happiness, and remembrance. Narciso is proud and thankful of his parents, of them coming all this way by themselves and having to start their whole lives over. He expresses this clearly when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They came to @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life."" They struggled, taking any job that they could find, whether it was menial or difficult. They endured long hours and tough conditions, all for him, so he didn't have to struggle. Narcisco admires them for ""their strength and perseverance."" Narciso sets the mood in the memoir as gratefulness to his parents and for all that they have done for him. He is happy with the life they have created for him, and is happy that they have done so well. When he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" it shows his deep - seated happiness. Narciso is happy and grateful for his life that he was given by his parents, and this mood of gratitude and happiness lingers throughout the memoir, making it a heart - warming read."
191	12017	5	3	The author skillfully created a calm mood throughout the text. Everything he talks about maintains the same steady tone. When he specifically talks about the cozy kitchen in his home, he also manages to create a happy mood, as if the warmth of the kitchen radiates through the words. He remains calm while recalling the precious memories in his old home, and he stays composed when he talks about how caring his parents were, with details of their gentle actions subtly seeping into the narrative. Overall, the whole writing is bathed in a calm mood that soothes the reader's heart.
192	12018	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this story encompasses a couple of different types. One of those moods is a happy and good mood. For instance, when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" it clearly shows a good mood because it is centered around the profound emotion of loving. Another example of a happy or good mood is when the story mentions that ""Countless extended family members came and went, and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This shows a happy mood as they are warmly welcoming people into their family. Another mood in the story is sad. When it says ""Could not afford to move into a modest three - room apartment,"" it creates a sad mood because one always wishes the best for people, and the fact that they are too poor to afford a decent place is truly disheartening. Also, the statement ""They struggled both personally and financially"" indicates a sad mood as they are having a tough time getting by. There is more than one mood in this story, but the most important mood, I think, is loving. An example of loving is when it states ""all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there vividly shows love. Understanding this loving mood is the most important aspect to grasp in this story."
193	12019	5	3	The mood created by the author starts off with a medium normal tune. In the beginning, he is simply describing who he is, where he lives, and what his daily life is like, painting a straightforward picture. Then, towards the middle and end, in my perspective, it changes a great deal. It shifts to a sad tone, not only because his life was hard but also because of how grateful he is. The way he describes his parents makes them seem like great people, as he thinks about everything they did for him. I arrived at this answer by carefully observing the beginning and ending of the story. It shows how sad his life was, yet he seemed to make the best of things, saying he had a good time in everything he did. That's my opinion and answer to the mood presented in the story.
194	12020	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir is a strong sense of gratefulness. The author effectively conveys this gratefulness by repeatedly emphasizing what his parents gave him and clearly stating that he is deeply grateful for it. First, he talks about how he is truly grateful that his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1, it specifically says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This clearly shows that the author is grateful for his parents showing him the joy of loving cooking. Another time the author expresses his gratefulness is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that the author is grateful for his parents' endurance and determination to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is undeniably gratefulness. He was genuinely grateful for his parents giving him all they could, and this gratefulness permeates every page of the memoir."
195	12021	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", it tells us of how Narciso grew up with his parents who immigrated from Cuba. The mood created by the author is warm & comforting. For example, the mood is comforting because Narciso speaks of how his parents, with great effort, created a traditional Cuban home out of nothing but a one - bedroom apartment. The details of the home are carefully described, making it come alive in the reader's mind. Narciso describes his life being centered around the kitchen, where his parents were always providing what they could, doing their best for him. Narciso also states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could ever have done."" This shows that the love and sacrifice of his parents, and his deep - seated gratitude, contribute to the warm and comforting mood that envelops the memoir."
196	12022	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a warm and genuine happiness. It made me feel truly happy because it was heart - warming to know that ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This meant that all the kind and caring people around you that sincerely care about you are your ""family"". Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I deeply think if my parents were in the same difficult situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have unhesitatingly done the same selfless thing. My parents would have also whole - heartedly wanted, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 this memoir makes me feel happy because of how incredibly caring Narciso's parent's were, and it reminds us that love and care can create a real family."
197	12023	5	3	The mood of the memoir is a bright and cheerful happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family bravely crossed the border from Cuba to the United States with the hope of having a much better life. They made the arduous journey in 1956, but unfortunately had to patiently wait until 1970 to be joyfully reunited with their Aunts and @CAPS1. Now, they have a more spacious and comfortable bigger house. They are genuinely grateful that they live in the United States, where they can build a new and prosperous life. This overall situation in the memoir clearly contributes to the happy mood that pervades the story.
198	12024	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON1, a distinct mood is carefully created throughout the engaging story. Mood is a powerful feeling that is vividly displayed to the reader through the art of literature. In this particular well - crafted piece, the mood was a strong sense of proud and a lively festive one. @PERSON1 creates this mood by skillfully using various evocative words and phrases. First, @PERSON1 said, ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home"". This clearly shows his family's deep - seated pride because their house looks exactly like it did in Cuba, preserving their cultural heritage. Also, the theme was festive because @PERSON1 describes the large and exuberant parties and delicious dinners that were constantly held at his home, filling the air with joy. Third, @ORGANIZATION1 creates a festive mood when he wrote, ""My parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country"". This quote creates a festive theme because his family all whole - heartedly enjoyed partying with others, sharing in the happiness of new beginnings. In conclusion, in the memoir ""@PERSON2"", there was a consistent theme of festivity and pride throughout this whole meaningful piece of literature, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
199	12025	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, there was only one distinct @LOCATION1 mood I firmly think. The mood I think the author was sincerely trying to make people feel is a pure and unadulterated happiness. There are a lot of compelling examples that make me think that. One example that I think is the most outstanding is the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". I think this is the best example of happiness because even though they didn't live in the biggest or most luxurious house, they were still content and happy with what they had, finding joy in the love and warmth within their home. That is what I think the mood created by the author was, a beautiful celebration of simple happiness."
200	12026	5	3	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound and touching sense of closeness and selflessness that so richly enriched Narciso's childhood. The mood created by Narciso comes from his heartfelt memoir, in which he lived a materially poor life, but a life that was abundantly enriched by friends and family that had an extremely close and unbreakable bond. This bond was so strong that it overcame the harsh realities of racism and tough times. As he writes, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The mood created by Narciso vividly displays how his community interacted and acted, and clearly shows how incredibly close his friends and family were. It is a mood that effectively helps readers understand the unique and warm - hearted nature of Narciso's community. The mood created by Narciso is also one of selflessness, as Narciso describes his community as one of ""honest, hardworking immigrants who generously extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1, Narciso creates a mood of closeness and selflessness that makes the reader appreciate the power of community and kindness."
201	12027	5	3	@PERSON1 is a heart - warming short story about a young boy who is brimming with gratitude and constantly shows a great deal of appreciation towards his parents. Despite having moved to @LOCATION1, he has a deep - seated feeling that he is right at home. In paragraph @NUM1, it specifically mentions that his parents went to great lengths to recreate the essence of their Cuban home. They adorned the walls with various Cuban artifacts, from colorful paintings depicting Cuban landscapes to traditional Cuban handicrafts. This made the new house feel like a slice of Cuba. I can clearly sense that in this short story, the boy is extremely grateful. As he stated in paragraph @NUM2, he will forever hold in his heart how his parents transformed this simple house into a loving and familiar home. Overall, @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story that beautifully portrays the power of family and gratitude.
202	12028	5	3	"In the excerpt of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a memoir penned by @PERSON1, an internationally recognized clothing designer, there is a distinct and palpable mood. It is a mood filled with fond recollection of a warm and loving environment that was crafted with care, as well as a profound gratefulness for the valuable lessons learned within this nurturing space. Narciso poignantly mentions how his parents selflessly created a home for him, even though it entailed making countless, arduous sacrifices. He vividly describes his @NUM1 - room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote serves as a crucial starting point, beginning the detailed explanation of why his house is the source of so many heart - warming memories that are so clearly conveyed in his writing. Narciso further explains that in his neighborhood, many of the residents are immigrants. These immigrants come together, offering a helping hand to one another and forming one big, close - knit family. As he puts it, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many neighbors joined Narciso's family for meals, and these shared meals brought them all even closer. At the end of the memoir, Narciso expresses with deep emotion how grateful he is that his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to provide him with a better chance in @LOCATION1, despite all the hardships they faced. This undeniable thankfulness is indeed a large and integral part of this memoir."
203	12029	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez has an incredibly deep - seated love for his family and home. In his memoir, he elaborately talks about the numerous sacrifices his parents made. His parents left behind their familiar lives in Cuba and moved to New Jersey, driven by the hope of a better life for themselves and for him, regardless of the high cost. His memoir is a heartfelt ode to the love for his parents and his overwhelming gratitude toward them. He earnestly wants readers to be able to truly feel the immense happiness that washes over him when he thinks about his home and the wonderful life that his parents painstakingly provided for him. He is fully aware of his good fortune, and as a result, his memoir has a very upbeat tone. It serves as a powerful reminder that even in the most difficult of times, one can still live life to its fullest extent.
204	12030	5	3	"In this memoir, there is a rich tapestry of moods. There is love, friendship, and happiness all intertwined. Narciso expresses a deep - seated love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1. The quote ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" is telling. It clearly shows that everyone in the neighborhood comes together, and there is a genuine sense of care and concern for one another. She further expresses friendship in paragraph @NUM2. When she shares that her babysitter was her first friend, it gives a glimpse into the close - knit relationships she formed. Finally, she expresses happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, when she says ""she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home,"" it is evident that she is brimming with happiness and is extremely grateful for her parents. These are the prominent moods in the memoir, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for the readers."
205	12031	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is deeply thankful for what his parents bestowed upon him, and this thankfulness is the overarching mood in the memoir. Rodriguez is acutely aware and thankful that his parents made the difficult decision to leave Cuba and come to a new land to give him a better life. He acknowledges that his parents had to leave behind not just family and friends but also their established careers in the country they held dear. Rodriguez is also thankful that his parents instilled in him the values of selflessness and generosity. For instance, he mentions that ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This act of opening their home to those in need is a true testament to their generosity. Overall, Rodriguez is thankful for his Cuban culture. Cuban culture, in his eyes, encompasses the joy of cooking delicious Cuban dishes and the rhythm of Cuban music, but most importantly, it is about family. Family, for him, has nothing to do with being a blood relative; it is about having respect and love for everyone. The mood of this memoir is one of thankfulness, and it is presented in all these different and meaningful ways, making it a touching and memorable read."
206	12032	5	3	The @CAPS1 that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gritty streets of Newark, New Jersey (which gradually became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was filled with Spanish, @PERSON1, and Italian immigrants. His family would often come over, and they would have warm, home - cooked dinners together. They would even have people stay in their house until those individuals got back on their feet. He had a childhood brimming with family and friendship, which is truly a wonderful thing to have.
207	12033	5	3	"The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author vividly describes her risk - taking, loving parents. She details the many precious things her parents have bestowed upon her. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" As you can clearly see, the author, Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with a profound sense of happiness and gratefulness. This is all generously and openly spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these positive tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. In this case, the author whole - heartedly wanted to express joy in her writing, which makes the excerpt a delightful read."
208	12034	5	3	"The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso sincerely says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for the love and sacrifice."" When he is saying this, he is clearly showing that he is extremely happy with his parents. In the memoir, he elaborately talks about how he deeply loves his house and explains in detail why he loves it and all the wonderful memories in that house. This shows that the mood of this memoir is a more happy one instead of a sad one. For instance, in paragraph @NUM2 when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Also, when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""It's here where I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This all contributes to the overall happy and grateful mood of the memoir."
209	12035	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. I think there is happiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" This clearly means that there was a happy and friendly family environment. The sense of unity and togetherness described in that paragraph reflects a positive and joyous mood. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and these are some of the reasons why the memoir exudes such a happy atmosphere."
210	12036	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is interesting. First of all, his parents ""originally from Cuba but arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one - room apartment, twenty - one - year - old Rawedia Maria and twenty - seven - year - old @ORGANIZATION1 could finally afford to move into a modest three - room apartment I would soon call home. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. The author's detailed account of his parents' journey and his own birthplace adds an element of intrigue. The description of the family's living situation and the transition from a small apartment to a new home makes the story engaging. That's how the mood is interesting from the author's creation, as it draws the reader into the unique circumstances of his early life."
211	12037	5	3	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a genuinely grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso clearly expresses how deeply grateful he was to have parents who were so self - sacrificing. They left everything behind in their homeland, all their familiar surroundings and connections, so that he could have a better life in a new place. He also sounded sincerely grateful when he talked about the harmonious community in his neighborhood. The Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people there would work together in unity, instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he truly learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"", he didn't mean the traditional blood - relative family. What he means by family is that everyone who would come into his apartment, whether they were neighbors or friends, and everyone in the building was like family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is undeniably grateful, which comes through clearly in every word."
212	12038	5	3	"This memoir created a warm, truly touching mood while the author explained his childhood experiences. I especially think the part when he said, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This sentence vividly shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood, painting a picture of a happy and close - knit environment. Also, where he states that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative"" really makes his memoir interesting because it is also teaching valuable lessons about the true essence of family. All in all, this memoir was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget. I hope that I too can write a memoir as heart - warming and interesting as this one, capturing the special moments and feelings of life."
213	12039	5	3	"The author created a joyful mood throughout the writing. The author said, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" He elaborately talks about how the people in his life are so close, and they don't have to be related by blood to be considered family. It shows a strong sense of community and belonging. The author also says, ""my mother and father had came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" The author is clearly proud of his parents for doing that, as it takes a huge amount of courage to leave one's home and start anew in an unfamiliar place. This pride and the sense of community contribute to the overall joyful mood of the text."
214	12040	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is happy because he is enthusiastically talking about starting a new life in a fresh environment and how incredibly grateful he is for the wonderful family he has. The way he shows his happiness is also evident in the fact that he has his 'family' such as cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents by his side, providing him with love and support. The place where he lives is also a source of happiness for him. He loves it there as he has his friends and babysitter living above him. Knowing that they are there for him at all times gives him a sense of security and joy. That's why I think the mood is happy, as it can be clearly told by the story and the positive @CAPS2 words he uses.
215	12041	5	3	"In the memoir, the author created the mood that Narciso Rodriguez was extremely proud of his Cuban culture and heritage. Family was very important to him, as is evident in paragraph @NUM1 where he states, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This shows that he had a broad and inclusive view of family, and he whole - heartedly accepted people as family, regardless of blood ties. His pride in his culture and the importance he places on family are key elements that shape the mood of the memoir, making it a story full of warmth and connection."
216	12042	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the memoir were grateful because of all the thoughtful things that the parents did for their child, like providing a warm and loving home environment. Friendly because they have ""family"" in the United States, and they always kept their arms open in a warm embrace and their door open for their ""family"", ready to welcome them at any time. Also, they had courage because they didn't give up trying to learn the language, spending hours poring over books and practicing with locals, and finding a job, submitting countless applications. The last mood that this memoir had was from paragraph seven, happiness. The child has many vivid memories of his/her Cuban heritage, still listens to Cuban music with great enthusiasm, and was born and raised in the United States, which makes for a unique and fulfilling life experience."
217	12043	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is truly happy. The author describes his home as a warm and inviting place that is specifically a haven for family gatherings and shared moments. He is deeply grateful to his parents for all the sacrifices and efforts they made, like providing a stable home and emotional support. The author thoroughly enjoyed his childhood. He was constantly surrounded by loving relatives and lots of friendly playmates. That is how in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author's happiness is clearly evident through these aspects of his life."
218	12044	5	3	"The mood of the author is a very gentle yet very happy tone. The reason it's gentle is because he's carefully describing how he grew up and what his daily life was like, recalling small details with tenderness. To some people, they could just blab all day without much thought, but to most, they have to painstakingly dig through memories so that they can get the scene just right, capturing the essence of the moment. For example, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" As for the parts where the mood was very happy, it was probably parts that he could remember the most clearly with rich detail. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably often cooks for his family using his parents' recipes, reliving those happy moments every time he steps into the kitchen. In this way, the author's mood is effectively conveyed through these recollections."
219	12045	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is definitely being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he thoroughly explains how he grew up throughout his whole life, from the early days of struggle to the later stages of self - discovery. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, facing financial hardships and social challenges, to being a famous fashion designer, achieving international recognition. Lastly, this memoir's mood also seems proud because he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" showing his appreciation for his roots. Overall, the author makes himself seem proud of his journey, his family, and his achievements."
220	12046	5	3	The mood that was set in the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is such that the mood created by the author was to deeply reflect on your life and to vividly relive the great experiences that the author has gone through in his mind. It was just to think of all the wonderful times the author had with your family, like the laughter around the dinner table and the shared holidays. This mood encourages the reader to also look back on their own family moments and cherish them. In this way, the author effectively uses the memoir to evoke a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for family life.
221	12047	5	3	"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood crafted by the author is one of profound gratitude and intense passion. Throughout the passage, the author deliberately employs very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" which evokes a sensory and rich experience, ""endless,"" suggesting boundless possibilities, ""encompassed,"" giving a sense of being fully surrounded, and ""instilled,"" indicating a deep - seated influence. This clearly shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate about the subject matter and aims to convey that to the readers in a subtle yet impactful way. As a result, readers perceive a very rich and passionate mood while delving into the memoir. Another element in the passage adds a layer of gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author artfully adds bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader acutely perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" directly account for the feeling of gratitude the reader picks up on. Another way the author creates this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These phrases and the statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which creates a mood of gratitude. As a result, the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is vividly shown through the author's careful choice of words and statements. That is why I would firmly describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionate and full of heartfelt gratitude."
222	12048	5	3	The memoir's mood is a palpable sense of happiness because it's vividly talking about a place where neighbors are like an extended family and everyone is very closely - knit. For instance, Sergio and @PERSON1, who were people living in the basement apartment, became his surrogate grandparents. Alegria, his first friend, would normally sit down and have dinner with them. The whole memoir is centered around how his parents showed him the true meaning of family and taught him to be open - hearted towards friends and neighbors. This portrayal of a warm, inclusive community creates a lasting sense of happiness within the pages of the memoir, making it clear that the relationships and experiences described are the sources of this joyful mood.
223	12049	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete and unwavering gratefulness. The author is not just very, but extremely thankful for his parents' sacrifice, love, tender care, and selfless nature. He also manages to create a mood of happiness, unity, and an overall loving atmosphere that he has witnessed throughout his lifetime. The author describes his deep - seated gratefulness towards his parents by vividly remembering how they had to leave Cuba, their native country, behind, along with their friends, family, and jobs. They did this because they earnestly wished to give the child they so desired better life opportunities that could only be found in @LOCATION1. He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, the attentive caring, the wonderful family, the new friends, and the selflessness they brought into his life. He describes situations where his parents had to make new friends and build a new family from around their neighborhood, and from that, a strong sense of love, friendship, and unity was discovered. As his family circle got larger, the author talks about how his childhood, small, three - room apartment was transformed into a truly completed home. When all of these details are combined, along with language such as ""I've thanked them repeatedly,"" a mood and feeling of utter gratefulness is strongly felt throughout the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."" This memoir stands as a testament to the power of family and the gratitude one can feel for the sacrifices made on their behalf."
224	12050	5	3	I described the mood created by the author in the memoir, and it's evident that they put in a great deal of effort to achieve it. They carefully select words, construct sentences, and arrange events in a way that gradually builds and conveys the intended mood. Whether it's through the use of descriptive language, the pacing of the story, or the tone of the narrative, every aspect is crafted with precision. By doing so, the author manages to immerse the reader in the mood they've created, making the reading experience more engaging and impactful. In conclusion, the author's hard work in creating the mood is clearly reflected in the overall feel of the memoir.
225	12051	5	3	"The mood created by the author was a very warm - hearted, grateful, and happy mood in his memoir. For example, in paragraph six, he explicitly states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This straightforward statement clearly shows how deeply grateful he is to his parents. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors, as it is evident in paragraph three when the author says ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This statement implies that Narciso Rodriguez has a very neighborly spirit, and his neighbors also share the same happy, grateful, and neighborly outlook. They all contribute to the positive atmosphere described in the memoir. All of these reasons comprehensively explain the mood of Narciso Rodriguez, which is a beautiful blend of gratitude and happiness that permeates the entire memoir."
226	12052	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON1, he vividly describes the mood. The first notable aspect of the mood is love. For starters, he poignantly says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Here, he clearly conveys that your friends can truly be your family, or the people you love deeply can take on that familial role. Secondly, he tenderly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Right at this moment, he is expressing heartfelt thanks to his parents for the wonderful life they have given him. Finally, he emotionally declares, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In this statement, he is emphasizing that he will forever cherish the time when he was living in a warm home filled with the love of his family. In conclusion, @PERSON1 Rodriguez not only describes the mood but also shares glimpses of his childhood when he truly learned about the essence of family."
227	12053	5	3	He/she tries to make you feel sad, perhaps through certain actions or words. I don't even know if this so - called attempt to make me sad is real or just an illusion. But in the end, it didn't work at all. It seems that their efforts to evoke sadness in me were in vain, and I remained unaffected by their supposed tactics.
228	12054	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is truly very uplifting and happy. One clear reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it elaborately talks about how grateful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, it sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I deeply thought that this line was extremely meaningful and uplifting because he's basically thanking his parents whole - heartedly for immigrating and giving him a much better life. Another reason I believe this article is uplifting and happy is that in paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found this statement very uplifting as essentially what he is saying is that family doesn't always mean those you are related to by blood, but rather the people around you who love and support you unconditionally. Lastly, this article is uplifting because it powerfully shows that love can truly make a significant difference in one's life, leaving the readers with a warm and positive feeling."
229	12055	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood that the author created can be @CAPS1 in two distinct ways. First, it was a happy mood, stemming from the joy of being created and having the opportunity to experience America's beautiful friendliness. The quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with a blood relative"" reflects this happiness, as it shows a sense of belonging and acceptance. @CAPS2 was the realization that knowing if you have hope, anything can be achieved. The statement ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" embodies this hope, as it shows the power of determination and love. Overall, the mood in the memoir is a combination of these two positive elements that leave a lasting impression on the reader."
230	12056	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a very specific mood that remains the same throughout. The mood of this memoir is a comforting and happy one. One way that this mood was @CAPS1 is that they elaborately talked about how their environment showed a great sense of family. When I think of family, I naturally see the mood as comforting and happy. The quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" clearly shows this mood. His family always warmly took in people and made them feel genuinely welcomed, which added to the comforting and happy atmosphere. Another reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it described how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. The statement ""It was a close - knit community of honest hard - working immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" further emphasizes this. This is how the memoir effectively showed a happy and comforting mood, leaving the readers with a sense of warmth and contentment."
231	12057	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is a sense of togetherness where the family is well - organized. My parents both actively shared the cooking duties. They would often stand side by side in the kitchen, one chopping vegetables while the other stirred the pot. Through their daily cooking routines, they unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love of cooking that is still with me today. The parents were truly focused on how to organize the family effectively. That is the warm and harmonious mood that is created by the author in the memoir."
232	12058	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound love. An example from the text vividly says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any prior knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and promising careers in the country they deeply loved."" Another example from the text tenderly says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my sincere admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the clear demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion, because of his parents' deep love for him, they made a great many sacrifices so he could have a happy and good life."
233	12059	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of being grateful and happy. The reason I say that is because if my parents did what the author's parents did, I should be extremely grateful. They made all these efforts for me to be happy and to have a better life. The author states ""And for which I am eternally grateful"". Also, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". It's truly amazing what the author's parents did. They are very strong - willed and they did it all for their children to be happy. This is precisely the reason why I picked those two moods in the memoir."
234	12060	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and grateful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells in detail about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 fondly says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that joyfully encompassed both, formed the beautiful backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 sincerely thanking his parents for all they have done and selflessly sacrificed for him. For example, at the end of the memoir @PERSON1 emotionally says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a heartfelt way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can clearly see, those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."
235	12061	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents transformed the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was truly astonishing. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music"" with enthusiasm, filling the house with vibrant rhythms. And their ""love of cooking"" was evident as they prepared delicious Cuban dishes, which helped create a warm family mood. It clearly showed how much they cherished and were proud of their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family genuinely loved spending time with each other, sharing laughter and stories, and celebrating every occasion. Overall, the mood is loving, happy, and caring, making the house a true haven of warmth and togetherness."
236	12062	5	3	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a deep - seated feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he frequently talks about spending quality time with his family. The home he was brought up in was a place full of warmth, where family members would gather around the dinner table, sharing stories and laughter, truly bringing everyone in his family together. This close - knit family environment made him extremely proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant the world to him, so another mood that permeated the text was love. It was the love for his family and the house he grew up in, a place where he first learned the true meaning of love. His parents dedicated so much time and effort to him, and as he put it, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He absorbed every bit of wisdom and knowledge he could ever think about from his parents, and his love for them is palpable. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez, and they left a lasting impression on me."
237	12063	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a distinct mood. Narciso Rodriguez crafted a gentle mood that remained consistent throughout. @CAPS1 tells how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" This implies that @CAPS1 probably grew up in a peaceful life, free from much violence. The home was filled with kindness and acceptance. @CAPS1 also expresses that @CAPS1 ""will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them deeply and shows this gratitude by constantly thinking about them. Lastly, @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 consistently focuses on the good things about his life, rather than dwelling on the bad. This gentle mood makes the memoir a heart - warming read."
238	12064	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was a bright and happy one. The first indication that the mood is happy in this memoir is when the @CAPS2 wrote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"". This clearly shows that @CAPS3 really has a deep - seated love for her Culture's music, and the mention of it brings a sense of joy. Another thing is when @CAPS3 said ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". It means that in that warm and inclusive environment, @CAPS3 understood that for true family, it's not necessary to be related by blood. All that matters is that someone loves and cares about you whole - heartedly. Last thing is when the @CAPS2 said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This meant that @CAPS3 will always remember that her family started small and then grew big as relatives came to their house and they began their new life there. The happy mood makes the memoir a delightful read."
239	12065	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is the rich feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home. This feeling could be aptly described as homey. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the unique customs of his house and how they are an integral part of daily life. The @CAPS1 describes his house as a simple abode, but filled with the lively sounds of Cuban music and the enticing scent of Cuban food wafting through the rooms. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to depict his house is the same feeling that permeates the whole memoir. It's as if the essence of the house flooded the memoir with its warm and inviting feelings. Also, this memoir didn't only showcase Cuban cultural feelings; it also gave off strong family vibes, like how a family is happy and together. It vividly expressed how the @CAPS1 was incredibly close to his family, making the memoir a heart - warming account.
240	12066	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memories is a complex yet captivating one. As the author delves into the past, certain emotions start to surface. There's a sense of nostalgia that lingers, as if the author is looking back at a time filled with both joy and a tinge of sadness. The memories seem to be a blend of happy moments, like family gatherings and cultural celebrations, and perhaps some bittersweet ones, such as the passing of time and the changes that have occurred. The author's descriptions paint a vivid picture, making the reader feel as if they are right there in the midst of those memories. Whether it's the warmth of a summer day or the coziness of a winter evening, the mood is carefully crafted to draw the reader in. In the end, the mood in these memories leaves an indelible mark, making the reader reflect on their own past experiences.
241	12067	5	3	The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1, a period filled with warmth and joy. Because in the memoir it was vividly talking about how he deeply loved his home, the delicious aroma of his parents' cooking wafting through the air, and the soothing melodies of music that filled their days. He was @CAPS2 truly grateful for his parents' unwavering caring and self - less dedication. He liked how his home was a vibrant community for Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, where different cultures blended harmoniously. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts, with colorful decorations, laughter, and the company of loved ones, and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story.
242	12068	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso projects a very grateful, thankful + optimistic mood. With every sentence, he sincerely thanks a specific person for bringing such wonderfulness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso earnestly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it clearly shows that Narciso is extremely grateful towards his parents. They brought him to @LOCATION1, enabling him to become who he is today and who he was in the past. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He genuinely felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, far better than it would've or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two - family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and he whole - heartedly thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optimistic man."
243	12069	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad. The examples of how it is happy are the way the author vividly describes in paragraph @NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house. It states, ""twenty - one - year - old @PERSON2 and twenty - seven - year - old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2 - room apartment,"" which was a significant step forward for the family. Another example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were carefully decorating the apartment to look like a traditional - Cuban home, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home,"" filling it with the warmth of their culture. Yet another example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard - working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" creating a sense of belonging. And the final example is when he mentions that lots of his family and friends often grace their kitchen table, sharing meals and stories. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their loved ones to take on a life in @LOCATION1. An example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve. These are the various moods set by the author in this memoir."
244	12070	5	3	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a grateful and happy feeling. I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, always sincerely brings up how he is grateful for his parents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, he clearly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" showing his deep - seated appreciation. Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At a time when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Even though there was racism in the society, the people in his community were able to put aside differences and be friends, creating a positive and happy atmosphere. This combination of gratitude and happiness pervades the memoir."
245	12071	5	3	"The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefulness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1, it poignantly says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In fact, all of paragraph @NUM1 is centered around how grateful he is to his parents for their brave and self - less act. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Also, all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his deep admiration towards his parents. So, the mood that permeates the memoir was love, a profound love and appreciation towards his parents."
246	12072	5	3	"In the non - fiction memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso vividly talks about his life growing up in a particular neighborhood, his cozy home, and the diverse people around him. The author considered his neighbors as family too, not just his parents and brothers and sisters. He saw the unique bonds formed with them as an integral part of his life. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... a close knit community."" (par @NUM1) This gives the memoir a warm and friendly mood, clearly showing that the author deeply loved his whole neighborhood. The author also frequently invited his neighbors into his home and was on very close terms with them. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table... more often than not. Also at the table... my surrogate grandparents."" (par @NUM2) This gives the memoir an inviting mood, as the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner, creating a lively and inclusive atmosphere. The author also talks about how deeply grateful he is for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (par @NUM3) This gives the memoir a sweet mood, as the author shows his genuine happiness and gratefulness for everything his parents had done for him. In conclusion, the author sets a very sweet, inviting mood by adding details of how joyful and enjoyable his childhood was, making the readers feel a sense of nostalgia for a close - knit community."
247	12073	5	3	The mood the author has is quite good. He's extremely proud of the way he lives, cherishing every little aspect of his daily life. The most important thing in his life is his family. His family members care a great deal about him and watch over him no matter what difficulties they may face. He is very thankful for all the love, support, and sacrifices his family has made for him. This strong family bond not only gives him a sense of security but also fills his life with warmth and happiness. In conclusion, the author's positive attitude towards his life and deep gratitude for his family create a heart - warming and content mood.
248	12074	5	3	The mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling. He elaborately talked about his family life, specifically how his parents had to give up all their possessions and familiar surroundings in Cuba to come to a new place and start over again. Despite the hardships, he makes everything sound really nice, like when everyone is crowded in the small dining room to eat. The close - quarters dining experience shows the strong family bond and the sense of togetherness. The shared meals, filled with laughter and conversation, create a homely and reassuring atmosphere. In conclusion, the author's description of his family's journey and the simple yet heart - warming moments at the dining table contribute to the overall warm and comforting mood of the story.
249	12075	5	3	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me, it is so comforting because it is such a genuinely happy memoir. These two young people are incredibly kind - hearted and invite other people over to their house all the time. They open their doors to those in need and let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness in this account, just a happy and inviting family environment which truly comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle they embrace. I love how they are so proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their vibrant Cuban music, filling the house with lively rhythms, and always cook their delicious Cuban food, the aroma of which spreads through the rooms. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves and celebrate their roots. It comforts me knowing that everyone in this family and their guests are happy and content. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort, a feeling that makes me long for such a warm and inclusive community.
250	12076	5	3	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was carefully explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and had felt throughout his life. The boy thought that his parents were really great, with their self - lessness and hard - work being beyond his reach. He felt that he could never be as wonderful as them. He was also extremely grateful that he had a house to live in and parents like the ones he did. He deeply admired his parents and all the sacrifices they made. He will never forget growing up and living in that house, where so many precious memories were created. The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was for what their parents did when they immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. Through the boy's story, the author conveys the power of parental love and the importance of being thankful for the opportunities that come from a new beginning in a foreign land. In conclusion, the author successfully creates a mood of gratitude and happiness, inspiring readers to appreciate their own family's sacrifices.
251	12077	5	3	"There was a distinct mood carefully crafted by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. Here are some key points to support this, including identifying a new mood, his deep - seated gratefulness, and his unique view on things. First, let's identify a new mood. As the text transitions from a regular sentence to a parenthesis, a fresh mood emerges and then fades back. The reason lies in the story where it states, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" This blend of music and scents creates an evocative new mood. Second, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is truly and genuinely grateful for how things have turned out. Another instance from the story supports this: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This direct statement clearly shows his gratitude. Third, his view on things. In @CAPS1's eyes, he had very fortunate times. Ultimately, these are the reasons for the mood, the parenthetical elements, the gratefulness, and his perspective that the author has created."
252	12078	5	3	"The mood of the author in the memoir is very evidently happy. It gives the distinct impression that it sounds like the child of a deeply grateful family is speaking. She stands out as one of the most grateful people I've ever read about. This is because she makes a powerful statement, saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" This shows that the love and effort her parents put into the house have left an indelible mark on her, contributing to the overall happy mood of the memoir."
253	12079	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truly original and captivating mood in the excerpt. Specifically, I would say he infuses a kind of profound grateful mood throughout the text. He is constantly and emphatically stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their remarkable selflessness and unwavering courage. One clear example of Narciso creating this grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This quote vividly shows how much sincere gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another instance where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez makes it clear that he fully understands what it took for his parents to come here. He is aware of the losses that his parents endured, and for that, he is truly and deeply grateful. Overall, Narciso's expressions of gratitude effectively create a warm and appreciative mood in the excerpt."
254	12080	5	3	"I believe that the mood created by the author is a delightful blend of happy and loving. In paragraph @NUM1, it states ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This implies that @CAPS1 realizes that not only the people blood - related to you are your family, but also friends and anyone close to you can be part of your family circle. The excerpt also states ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This act of hospitality and celebration shows the deep - seated love that everyone has for one another. Lastly, the excerpt states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This part of the text makes you feel a warm and fuzzy happiness about the concept of family, solidifying the happy and loving mood created by the author."
255	12081	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a rich variety of different moods throughout the memoir. In paragraph two, the author details how much culture was infused into his home, stating ""my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" @CAPS1 also expresses how thankful @CAPS1 is that his parents instilled in him a love of cooking and Cuban music. This description gives you a vivid feeling of the home being warm, comfortable, and most of all, full of life. In paragraph three, the author conveys that a family has nothing to do with blood relatives. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" As you read through the memoir, you really start to grasp the author's opinion on the definition of home and family. In paragraph six, you can clearly see how grateful the author is towards his parents, as he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This creates a mood of deep - seated gratefulness. In paragraph three and four, the author talks about the strong sense of unity. His parents would always have their door open to people in need, and the whole community was like one big family, as described by ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" ""My parents always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family..."" The general mood of this memoir is a harmonious blend of all these moods, creating a generous sense of home and community."
256	12082	5	3	"People make sacrifices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends in their homeland to give their son a better life in a new country. The author creates an enjoyable and heartwarming mood through vivid descriptions of their family life. Narciso is very grateful. He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot, like their familiar surroundings and established social circles, and he recognizes that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you. Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immigrants. They had left their family, too; and only had each other. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned two very important lessons: put others before yourself, and work hard. These lessons will guide him well through life."
257	12083	5	3	The @CAPS1 the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time. I think the @CAPS1 is mostly sentimental because the family moves to @LOCATION1 and kind of looks back to the good memories that happened in Cuba. They recall the warm family gatherings, the vibrant local festivals, and the familiar streets where they spent their childhood. Even though they are starting a new life in @LOCATION1, those memories from Cuba still hold a special place in their hearts. This mix of nostalgia and the hope for a new beginning contributes to the overall sentimental mood.
258	12084	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives has a happy mood. The author talks about ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" In paragraph @NUM1 which makes the house seem very happy and joyful. The lively rhythms of the music and the delicious scents of traditional Cuban dishes create a warm and inviting atmosphere. In paragraph @NUM1 the author also says ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" this makes the author seem very happy since they like to cook. The kitchen was a place where the family came together, shared stories, and prepared meals with love. Narciso Rodriguez talks about ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays"" the mood here seems that everybody liked to come to this house. The house became a place of community and celebration. This whole memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" makes the mood seem very happy and warm, evoking a sense of family and belonging."
259	12085	5	3	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankful mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not of high quality and they do not live an average middle - class life but a severely lower - class life. Their home might have had simple furnishings and limited space. However, throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, like scarce food supplies or old clothes, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him. These lessons of kindness and sharing will stay with him as valuable treasures."
260	12086	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. Positive words are often mentioned in the article. For example, it @CAPS1 ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,"" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the phrase ""extended a hand,"" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. These words paint a picture of a supportive and friendly community. The author's constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. It shows that the author appreciates the good things in life. Finally, this positive mood is shown through the setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice. As the memoir @CAPS1 ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This description of the setting shows a clear happy, cosy, positive mood. The mood created by the memoir is happy, positive, and nice because the memoir is worded with positive words, has often - mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting. This positive mood makes the readers feel good and appreciate the simple joys of life."
261	12087	5	3	The mood in the memoir is calm and thankful. The calmness stems from the fact that there are no apparent conflicts within the account. The thankful part is evident as he consistently expresses gratitude towards his parents. He appreciates the sacrifices they made, understanding that they did it for the well - being of the next generations. Overall, the mood in this memoir remains a harmonious blend of calmness and thankfulness.
262	12088	5	3	Before reading about @PERSON1, I truly don't think I've ever read about anyone who exudes as much happiness as @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is extremely happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still takes great pride in having another country's background, specifically Cuba. @PERSON1 was fortunate to have his house, which was situated in a wonderful neighborhood. The kitchen, in particular, was the heart of the house. Even though his house was neither a mansion nor anywhere close to being a large one, @PERSON1 was incredibly proud of where he lived. Most of all, @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents. Without them, he would still be living in Cuba and would have never experienced the joys of his great neighborhood, nor met all of his beloved family and friends.
263	12089	5	3	The mood created by the author is a deep - seated longing for the place where the author was born and raised. It is evident that the author misses that place more than anything and yearns to have that @CAPS1 back. The author will never forget the experiences, both the events that took place and the actions carried out in that house in @CAPS1. In essence, the author's words convey a powerful sense of nostalgia and a strong emotional bond to the lost home.
264	12090	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez delves into what he believes the definition of ""family"" truly is. He is very clear in stating that ""family"" does not merely mean blood relatives. Instead, ""family"" is about friends and family members coming together to form a close - knit community. In this community, everyone helps one another, and each person is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very distinct mood in this memoir, one that emphasizes everyone coming together. It's the kind of happiness and fullness one might feel after doing something kind for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez mentions how his dinner table is always filled with family and sometimes friends. His family's door is always open to those in need of help. When you read his memoir, you truly grasp what ""family"" really means. It's the feeling of love, openness, willingness, and happiness that you experience when helping others and being around those you love and who love you in return. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is so powerful that it really makes people pause and reflect on the true meaning of family."
265	12091	5	3	"In the memoir, the author successfully creates a happy mood. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez elaborates on what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood. He does this by describing how his kitchen table was constantly surrounded by his ""family"". As he puts it, ""countless extended family members came and went."" This clearly shows that there were always people around, creating a warm and lively atmosphere. He also expresses his gratitude for how his parents came to the @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life"". Finally, he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir, the author effectively creates a happy mood by reminiscing about his childhood filled with the presence of family and by thanking his parents for the sacrifices they made to provide him with a better life."
266	12092	5	3	There is a good mood attached to this memoir. The mood is a warm, happy feeling. When you read the memoir, it makes you feel cozy. Just like being at your own home. But only a little different. This time you are reading a memoir. It really explains what is going on. It also gives a lot of past information, which I like in a memoir. But @PERSON1 seemed to really enjoy being Cuban. @CAPS7 came to really like her Cuban food. Her family was good - natured. The @LOCATION1 was a bad place when @CAPS7 was growing up as a child. The reason for this is because of racism and segregation. But otherwise, @CAPS7 has a good life, filled with these warm memories and a sense of self - discovery.
267	12093	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he elaborately talks about the love and unwavering support his whole family had. One clear example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me, that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they made the difficult decision to sacrifice everything they had for their children. This profound act of sacrifice truly embodies the essence of love. That is why I firmly think the mood of this memoir is love."
268	12094	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from The blue prints of our lives, there is a distinct mood. The mood is very happy and positive, with a strong sense of friendship and family. For example, they just moved from Cuba, leaving their family behind, solely for his better life. Also, it is very self - sacrificing because even though their friends and family were in Cuba, the parents moved to New Jersey to start a new life for the kids and create a home. This selfless act of moving to a new place for the well - being of their children really sets the warm and positive mood of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez.
269	12095	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, he feels a great amount of passion and love. He goes into great detail about his rich culture, describing its unique traditions and values, and says how much it means to him. He also feels deep - seated love, love for his family and friends who were always there for him through thick and thin. He says that family goes further than blood, emphasizing the importance of the emotional bonds and support that extend beyond just genetic relations. This shows that his memoir is filled with a profound sense of love and connection.
270	12096	5	3	The mood of the story is somewhat sad and somewhat happy. It's sad because he comes from a not - wealthy family and they were immigrants, facing the challenges of starting anew in a foreign land with limited resources. But it's happy because he finally knows the true meaning of family, which is a source of comfort and strength. These contrasting yet intertwined emotions of sadness and happiness shape the overall mood of the story, making it a poignant and relatable account.
271	12097	5	3	I think the mood is a very happy and grateful mood. The speaker seems extremely happy about her life and how it was while growing up. Narciso seems very grateful for her parents and everyone around her during her whole upbringing. Also, she is appreciative of how her neighborhood was. Everyone there was happy and all were friends, and there were a lot of immigrants in her neighborhood. This kind of environment surely made her childhood filled with joy and warmth.
272	12098	5	3	"What is the mood of the memoir? The mood is elated. One reason is because ""My parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This seems very happy to me because moving from your native country can be an extremely hard and challenging experience. So, his parents brought some essence of Cuba with them, creating a familiar and comforting space. That is the reason the mood is elated, as it shows the ability to adapt and find happiness in a new place."
273	12099	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The author said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, they created a truly great place to live. The mood is also very hopeful. This is because the author's parents came to America with nothing, but through all their hard work, they overcame their struggles and even helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were, making the community a warm and inclusive place."
274	12100	5	3	"In 1956, Narciso Rodriguez's parents arrived in the United States and bought a small @NUM1 - room apartment. In 1961, Narciso was born and he began his life. In this story, Narciso describes his childhood. The home was very lively; it was a traditional Cuban home that consisted of a kitchen which was truly the heart of the home. Both of his parents loved to cook and listened to Cuban music. Narciso says ""The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" He also got a good sense of family, and it was not just those who were related to him by blood but also those who cared for him. Although people had different customs or cultures, they still all came together. People often came to Narciso's home and were allowed to stay while getting back on their feet because they believed in helping one another. Narciso was extremely grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. They taught him about the true meaning of love and family, and they also created a home full of memories he will never forget."
275	12101	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very soft and compassionate. The reason I would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is that when Narciso Rodriguez describes growing up with his parents and in Cuba, he never mentioned anything about what he hated about his family and about living in Cuba. Instead, he describes all of what he loved about growing up as a child. For example, he says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that just because you're not related by blood doesn't mean you're not family. Another reason why I would describe the mood of the author as soft and compassionate is that at the end of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In conclusion, these are the ways why I would describe the mood created by the author as soft and compassionate, highlighting the positive and loving aspects of his upbringing."
276	12102	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir was a deep - seated sense of gratefulness and pure happiness for all that he had. The author truly values relationships, and he holds a profound gratitude for having his ""family"". He says, ""Growing up in this vibrant and diverse environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1"". In other words, he is clearly stating that he is incredibly lucky to have what he has, this unique ""family"". Being lucky for what you have also serves as a synonym for being grateful, which clearly indicates that the mood of this memoir was one of gratitude. He also mentioned that his family always kept an open door and open arms, readily showing that they would generously give some of what they had to other people. This act shows that they were well - aware that others had less, and they were genuinely grateful for their own blessings. Mood, essentially, means tone or a prevailing feeling, so the mood of this memoir was unmistakably grateful and happy."
277	12103	5	3	"In this memoir by @PERSON1, he skillfully sets the overall mood for his ""definition of family"". Rodriguez's parents are Cuban immigrants, and they live in a lively community full of all different ethnic groups. ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" form the fabric of their community. The Rodriguez family was enormous, and their doors were always wide open to anyone who needed assistance. Every evening, the table at their house was always filled with a delicious spread for dinner. The mood set was one of extremely kind and helpful personalities. Families are much bigger than just ""blood relatives""; they are the people who you deeply care about and help, or who offer you their help in return. ""I will never forget how my parents, with their love and efforts, turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" This clearly shows the special mood that the author has created in the memoir, emphasizing the true meaning of family."
278	12104	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a mood of profound gratitude. To support a claim like this, I will provide solid evidence. It clearly says in the article that ""I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice."" This statement clearly shows how the author is deliberately trying to create a mood of gratitude. His gratitude is being openly shown towards his parents. Also, it mentions that they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. This shows how the family leaves behind the comfort of their homeland to face a troublesome life in a new place for their children, thus making the children extremely grateful. The mood created by the author is one of gratefulness and is consistently shown throughout the whole memoir, making it a central theme that the readers can easily feel."
279	12105	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author artfully creates a mood. First, the author vividly shows feelings in this part: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, gently mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" The author portrays a feeling of a warm, wonderful household filled with the joy of music and the art of cooking. Next, the author shows a feeling of a nice, warm childhood here: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the idyllic backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author clearly enjoyed a nice childhood, filled with the company of friends and family, all relishing the wonders of their home. That is how the author masterfully sets the mood in the memoir, making the readers feel the warmth and happiness of the author's past."
280	12106	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a truly happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood when the author says, ""Growing up in this warm and inclusive environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This statement sets a loving mood because the author is essentially saying that a person can be so close to you and love you so deeply that you whole - heartedly consider them family even though you are not even related by blood. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and successful careers in the country they loved."" This quote powerfully shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they were willing to make huge sacrifices so that their children could have better lives and be truly happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir, a mood that warms the heart and makes the readers feel the power of love and family."
281	12107	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of deep - seated gratitude because Narciso is genuinely glad to be in @LOCATION1 alongside his family. In paragraph @NUM1, lines @NUM2 - , the author pens, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often expressed my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly with all my heart."" This heartfelt expression clearly shows that the mood created by the author in the memoir was one of profound gratitude."
282	12108	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in numerous ways. Here are some key points to take into account. First, the predominant mood of the author, in my opinion, is a deep - seated gratefulness. For instance, the text states ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day)"", clearly indicating this sentiment. Second, the author also conveys a strong sense of appreciation. As an example, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a warm and inviting home."" @CAPS1 I firmly believe that another prominent mood of the author is definitely love. I know this because he frequently talks about love, as well as his family and friends. For example, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many valuable lessons I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the author's moods can be described in a variety of different ways, each adding depth to the memoir."
283	12109	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is a delightful blend of happiness and warmth. It commences by discussing the valuable things Narciso learned in the home. The Cuban music, ""which I [Narciso] adore to this day"", filled the house with a lively and cultural atmosphere. Alongside this, the culinary skills passed down, for which he states, ""I am eternally grateful"", added a sense of comfort and tradition. Narciso's evident happiness is a clear indication that the mood is indeed happy. Also, Narciso elaborately talks about the wonderful community. ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a helping hand..."", showing the strong bonds and support within the community. Narciso goes into great detail, painting a vivid picture of the good things, like the friendly and inclusive community. The author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants, including her parents. ""They came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" Narciso Rodriguez describes many positive impacts of her parents as immigrants. As a result of all this positivity, a truly happy mood is created throughout the memoir."
284	12110	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author crafted a consistently happy tone throughout the entire story. Narcisco recounted how when he moved to @LOCATION1, he settled into a cozy three - bedroom apartment. He carried with him a deep - rooted love for cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that has remained with me to this very day."" Narciso was extremely grateful that his parents made the journey to @LOCATION1, as they helped transform his home into a place that felt like a traditional Cuban haven. ""It was a simple house where my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in this new country, and where I joyously celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warm and inviting kitchen of this humble house that a Cuban feast always filled the air, not just with tantalizing scents and lively music but also with life and love. It was here that I learned the true meaning of 'family', and for that, I will never forget that house or its kind - hearted neighborhood or the many precious lessons I learned there. I will always cherish how my parents turned this simple house into a place full of love and memories, a true home."
285	12111	5	3	The mood of the story is like a poignant journey that starts as a sad tale and then leads to a heart - warming happy ending. It begins on a sad note because the family makes the difficult move from Cuba to the @ORGANIZATION1. They find themselves in a completely unfamiliar environment, knowing nothing about the local language or the new traditions. This sense of displacement and uncertainty weighs heavily on them at the start. However, the story takes a turn for the better when they move into an apartment. It provides them with a stable place to live. Moreover, they manage to find jobs to work at, which gives them a sense of purpose and financial security. This new - found stability and hope bring about a happier mood. In conclusion, the mood of the story evolves from sadness to happiness, making it a tale of resilience and new beginnings.
286	12112	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is deeply sad, yet also filled with loving and caring sentiments. @CAPS2 @NUM1 poignantly states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice; I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could of ever done."" Evidently, @CAPS1 he holds his parents in high respect, sincerely thanking them for crafting a great life for him. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM1 states ""They showned me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" This clearly conveys that @CAPS1 no matter what occurs, one should always return to their roots. It further emphasizes how vital family and friends are. Through this kid's eyes, we see the real @CAPS1 of ""family"", which is a precious and unwavering bond."
287	12113	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", penned by Narciso Rodriguez himself, I firmly believe that the @CAPS1 is attempting to re - create his/her past in a manner that imparts a few crucial life lessons about home and family to the reader. For instance, the quote ""It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home"" serves as a powerful reminder of the significance of these values. This memoir effectively showcases how our experiences within a family setting can transform a physical space into a warm and loving home."
288	12114	5	3	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, it unfolds as a sad story. The mood that the author is creating combines both sad and happy elements simultaneously. One notable example is when his parents decided to leave Cuba for their son's own good, seeking a better place for him. In Cuba, his parents held great jobs. His mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1, actively involved in her field of expertise. And his father worked in a laboratory, dedicated to his work. As stated, ""In Cuba @PERSON2,had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering."" Considering their well - established positions in Cuba, their departure was a huge sacrifice, which makes the author's mood of this story predominantly sad."
289	12115	5	3	He was deeply thankful that his parents made the difficult decision to move for him. He genuinely thinks it was an incredibly kind and selfless act. He even said that he doesn't believe he would have the same courage to do such a thing, so their sacrifice was highly meaningful to him. His parents chose to leave behind their loved ones in order to give him a better life. This act of parental love and sacrifice is truly remarkable and has had a profound impact on him.
290	12116	5	3	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two starkly contradicting moods. From chapters one to six, Narciso vividly described ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez went into in - depth detail, specifically mentioning Cuban cooking and music, leaving not a single detail out. At the beginning, there was an overwhelming sense of happiness and bliss. However, this soon fades as Narciso starts to speak of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both made great sacrifices by leaving their lives in @ORGANIZATION1 to live in @LOCATION1. ""In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1."" They were forced to take any job they could find just to make ends meet. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez expresses his deep - seated gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is indeed very lucky to have parents like @PERSON2 and Maria who selflessly watched over him and provided him with the best they could in a new and challenging environment."
291	12117	5	3	"According to the memoir, the mood crafted by the author is one where he's deeply thankful for all that his parents have given him. For instance, he clearly states in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso consistently told his parents how grateful he was for them. Yet, Narciso also laments, ""But in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude."" This shows that his appreciation for his parents runs deep and is hard to put into words."
292	12118	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a joyous one. It vividly showcases all sorts of memories that the family has in one particular house. As it is written in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents transformed this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" It emphasizes that a house is merely a physical structure and doesn't hold much meaning on its own, and anyone can enter it. In contrast, a home is the place where you reside, where you grow up and accumulate all your precious memories; it's truly a better and more special place. This makes the memoir a heart - warming read."
293	12119	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is one of pure happiness. The mood in the memoir is indeed happiness because the mother taught the author how to love people. As she said, ""Always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" It was in that environment that the author learned the real definition of ""family."" The author realized that a family isn't just about the people you love and isn't restricted to blood relatives. The author particularly liked when her mom welcomed anybody into their household and to the dinner table. This inclusive and loving approach is what makes the mood of the memoir so happy."
294	12120	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm and comforting feeling about their home life. Narciso elaborately talks about life at home and his parents' cooking. He is extremely grateful for his parents' delicious cooking and the valuable lessons he learned from them. In paragraph three, it states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This clearly shows that he considered the people around him as family, not just his blood relatives. He demonstrates this by sharing how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement, and he didn't get to know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. He is constantly thankful to his parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifice. The whole memoir is centered around love and family, which effectively sets a positive and heart - warming mood for the reader."
295	12121	5	3	The mood in the memoir is extremely calm. It lacks the tension and depression that can make a piece of writing heavy. An example of it being calm is in paragraph @NUM1. When the words are in the parentheses, it gives the impression that the person is having a friendly conversation with you. Also, it simply states facts and a @CAPS1 in a straightforward manner. Another example of the calmness is how the @CAPS1 is portrayed as happy rather than sad. The memoir has a smooth and easy - going flow to it, which further enhances the calm mood and makes it a relaxing read.
296	12122	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso, effectively shows a distinct mood. In the first paragraph, it vividly talks about where he comes from. ""My parents originally came from Cuba..."" This part starts with a calm and reflective mood, setting a gentle tone. In the third paragraph, it clearly states what it was like in the United States. ""Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants..."" It states that the new life in the United States is liked, and describes how the community is put together, showing a sense of acceptance and belonging. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso shows mood in different places, which enriches the overall reading experience."
297	12123	5	3	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is truly very touching. The memoir explains how as a kid, he didn't have much while growing up, but he did have a loving family. He was extremely grateful and proud of his parents for their arduous efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the language. When I hear about someone being that appreciative, it makes me think about how times have changed from when Narciso was growing up in the 1960s. He was so grateful and happy when compared to now, where he might seem to have nothing in material terms. But he was able to show all his gratitude with the deepest, heart - warming sympathy. All in all, he learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing one can have, which is a timeless lesson.
298	12124	5	3	This memoir's mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece. This story is about how Narciso Rodriguez's parents created a home. His parents put an abundance of love, strong unity, genuine kindness, and pure happiness into their home. He is sincerely thanking his parents for being brave and coming to the United States with very little and creating a solid foundation for their future life. He's thanking them for transforming their simple house into a truly loving home. The mood of this piece is a beautiful blend of graciousness and happiness. He is deeply gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making a home for the family. During this piece, he is genuinely happy that his parents were brave enough to come to the United States, which is why this memoir also has a happy mood, making it an endearing read.
299	12125	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very loving and caring mood. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez can't stress enough how much love, greatfulness, and respect he has towards his parents. For example, in paragraph 3, Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice"", clearly meaning the sacrifices his parents made for their children. He also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance... but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit and generosity..."" He cares about the lessons his parents taught him so much that he bases his life on them and will never forget them. But perhaps the most important thing Rodriguez says in this memoir is in paragraph 5, when he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sums up everything his parents taught and sacrificed for him, giving this simple sentence a profound and great meaning."
300	12126	5	3	"Throughout the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez portrays a mood of happiness and thankfulness towards his parents. Rodriguez writes ""Öand for which I am eternally grateful"" (page 12). Narciso Rodriguez is clearly expressing his thankfulness to his parents for the wonderful things they have taught him, such as the art of cooking. Another way this mood of happiness is portrayed is through his writing about people coming together. He writes ""all of these cultures came together showing great solidarity and friendship."" (page 25). He is happy and thankful for the connections he made with people of different cultures and ethnicities. Despite the racism going on in the places around them, his parents were able to bring people together by being warmly welcoming, genuinely helpful, and friendly. Lastly, he is grateful for all the things his parents sacrificed for him. He writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" (page 30). They taught him that money isn't everything and that family and friends are greatly important. They had the ability to impress upon him many qualities that benefited his life. He writes ""these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (page 30). The mood is clearly portrayed as happy and thankful about the valuable lessons his parents taught, which continue to shape his life."
301	12127	5	3	"The author created a mood that showed his true love for his family and his home by elaborately explaining his rich culture, his close - knit family, and how deeply grateful he is to his parents. He starts by going into detail about his culture, which includes ""Rich culinary skills....a love of cooking....passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"". This detailed description builds a base to this mood by vividly showing that his home was always filled with the delicious food and vibrant arts of his heritage. He then goes on to talk about his family, which ""had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". He explained how his true family was composed of many cultures that ""came together in great solidarity and friendship"". Finally, he thanks his parents for everything they did for him by moving to @LOCATION1 and for showing him how important family and friends are. ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is the mood expressed by the author, through his culture, family, and by showing gratitude to his parents for giving him a basis for life. This mood makes the readers feel the warmth and love within his life story."
302	12128	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the author. This mood is a mix of many things: love, generosity, and gratefulness. The love feeling comes from the strong bond between friends and family. To them, family was not just blood - related but also their community and friends. They would kindly let people stay at their house until they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner, sharing delicious meals and good times. The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them, like helping with daily needs. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children, leaving behind their familiar homeland. The sense of gratefulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were grateful, and so was the author. The author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there, making it a heart - warming story."
303	12129	5	3	The mood is very warm and welcoming. It starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment, filled with unique decorations and a cozy atmosphere. Then it talks about delicious foods, with mouth - watering descriptions of the flavors and aromas, and great music that fills the air with a lively rhythm. But at the end, it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life. This shift in mood makes the story more complex and relatable, as it shows both the joys and the bittersweet moments of life.
304	12130	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was calm. @CAPS1 says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" Through this description, she gives off a calm and relaxed feeling. It makes us envision a peaceful setting where time seems to slow down, and people can enjoy the simple pleasures of life. This calm mood pervades the memoir, making it a soothing read."
305	12131	5	3	"The mood in the memoir could be many things, but the one that really stands out to me is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is that @CAPS1 sincerely says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life, away from the hardships they once faced. Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her parents have gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents' lives were. The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir, a mood full of deep - seated gratitude."
306	12132	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of profound gratitude. The author was deeply feeling this gratitude because he was truly thankful for all that his parents had selflessly done for him. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This poignant line explicitly shows that the author is extremely grateful that his parents sacrificed a great deal so that the author could have a much better life. He was also brimming with gratitude as his parents' remarkable generosity helped him vividly understand how incredibly important family and friends are. In paragraph @NUM1, it also mentions, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This statement explains that the depth of his gratitude cannot be fully measured against what his parents so generously showed him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author in the memoir was indeed one of heartfelt gratitude."
307	12133	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is a palpable sense of love. @PERSON1 and his family, with open - heartedness, ""... always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the ""same for (them)"" (@NUM1). Even though ""(their) neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"" (@NUM2), they all genuinely cared for each other as if they were one big, close - knit family. Prior to moving to the United States, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" (@NUM3). They made the difficult decision to move to the United States, leaving behind their good jobs, so that their son could live a better life. Narciso doesn't take this great sacrifice for granted. He engulfs them in a profusion of sincere thanks. Throughout the memoir, the author constantly writes about all the caring and love that permeates the lives of @PERSON1 and his family, making the mood of love truly evident."
308	12134	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a deeply comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three, it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This clearly shows that he was so at ease in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a unique family beyond his blood relatives. Also, in the last sentence of this memoir, it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This indicates that the house had to be extremely comfortable to him if he affectionately calls it a home, because a home is a place where someone truly feels safe and completely comfortable. In conclusion, the mood of comfort is strongly established in the memoir."
309	12135	5	3	"The mood in the memoir given by the author makes me vividly think of my own home. Overall, it fills you with a warm and happy feeling inside. In the second paragraph, when he is elaborately explaining his house and the music playing, it automatically transports me to my house around the holidays. It's like when the music is playing cheerfully and you sing along without caring how bad your singing might be. You can clearly tell that this book gives the reader a very positive mood or a wonderful ""vibe"". In conclusion, the memoir's mood effectively evokes a sense of warmth and happiness similar to that of a home during the holidays."
310	12136	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is one of warmth and comforting. Narcis passionately talks about how his family is still rich in culture and is always open - armed to anyone who needs a family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso carefully describes his ""family"" that lives or visits often. It's quite evident that their home is a place where the door swings open with a warm, welcoming heart. People feel at ease and cared for when they enter this home, which truly showcases the mood of warmth and comfort. In conclusion, the mood of warmth and comfort is strongly present throughout the memoir."
311	12137	5	3	The mood that the author shows is a profound sense of happiness and love. In the memoir, he vividly talks about his mom and dad bravely coming to the @PERSON1 without any fear, despite not knowing anything about the local language or culture. Also, he elaborates on the time when the rest of his family arrives; his mom and dad whole - heartedly let them in with open arms. Moreover, when someone needs help to stand back on their feet, his parents are always there. The parents were genuinely happy about what they did and the people they loved, which truly reflects the warm and loving mood of the memoir.
312	12138	5	3	"The mood of the @CAPS1 in the memoir is clearly happy and filled with a deep sense of gratitude. A telling quote for this feeling of gratitude can be found in paragraph @NUM1. The author poignantly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote effectively captures the overall mood of the memoir, highlighting the author's appreciation for the love and sacrifices of their parents."
313	12139	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm, enveloped with an abundance of love. The author explains in detail how growing up in his environment had taught him that ""family"" didn't necessarily mean blood relatives. Everyone in his neighborhood came together in ""great solidarity and friendship,"" sharing joys and sorrows. Whenever family members, whether by blood or by the bonds of the neighborhood, went to the author's home, his parents would unhesitatingly take them in. They knew that if they were in the same situation, they would be welcomed as well. So, they always kept their arms and door wide open to those they considered family. The author also sincerely mentioned that he would always be grateful to his parents for their selfless love and sacrifice and emphasized how important family and friends are in life. In conclusion, the mood was warm and loving because he learned the real, inclusive meaning of ""family"" and how to love unconditionally."
314	12140	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very happy. Narciso Rodriguez, the main character and young Cuban boy, describes some of the hardships he and his family faced, such as his ""parents not being able to get the right jobs"" or ""facing cultural hardships."" However, despite these challenges, @CAPS1 Narciso focuses on all the good things that happened. For instance, his friend and babysitter, Alegria, always made him feel great with her kind and caring nature. Also, his parents passed on to him their love of cooking, creating wonderful memories in the kitchen. One thing Narciso will never forget is his parents' love and sacrifice. His parents always generously allowed family members to come and stay, sometimes just to help them get back on their feet. The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is beautifully described by Narciso Rodriguez, showing that even in the face of difficulties, there is much to be happy about."
315	12141	5	3	"The mood described in this memoir is mostly about love, unity, and culture. In terms of love, he shows that his parents immigrated mainly with the noble intention of giving their children a better future. This self - less act of love is described in paragraph @NUM1. When it comes to unity, it is evident that in their neighborhood, most of the immigrants were constantly having feasts and were extremely close to each other. This strong sense of unity is explained in paragraph @NUM2 where it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Regarding culture, his parents taught him how to cook traditional food from his country and also to dance to Cuban Music, as stated in paragraph @NUM3. These elements of love, unity, and culture combine to create the unique mood described in the memoir, making it a heart - warming account of an immigrant's experience."
316	12142	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a blend of gratitude, happiness, and a deep - seated love for his life. First of all, the mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound gratitude. Here is a telling quote from the text. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly shows the author's thankful heart towards his parents. Secondly, the mood created by the author in the memoir is that of pure happiness. Here is evidence from the article. ""A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" The description of the feast evokes a sense of joy. Finally, the mood created by the author in the memoir is that of loving his life. Here is a quote from the article. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, my main point here is to show you how joyful Narciso is, as his memoir is filled with these positive emotions."
317	12143	5	3	The mood created by the author is a palpable feeling of happiness and warmth because he's vividly talking about how he whole - heartedly enjoyed his old home. The memories associated with that place seem to bring a sense of contentment and comfort, making the overall mood of his words truly inviting and pleasant. In conclusion, the author successfully conveys this happy and warm mood through his description of the old home.
318	12144	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is one of deep - seated gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This statement clearly proves how the author is grateful for the culinary heritage passed down by his parents. Also in paragraph @NUM2, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This straightforward expression further shows the author's gratitude. Additionally, in paragraph @NUM2, it says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I thanked them repeatedly."" The fact that he thanked his parents more than once emphasizes his deep - felt gratitude. Finally, in paragraph @NUM4, the author explains how he learned the true definition of family. Then it says ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This also shows how grateful the author is because it details his appreciation for his neighborhood and the valuable lessons learned. In conclusion, the mood the author created is very much one of sincere gratitude."
319	12145	5	3	They'd sold what little furniture they'd possessed by then, items that had been with them through various moments of their lives. These pieces of furniture, though few in number, held memories, but circumstances had forced them to part with these possessions. In conclusion, selling the furniture was a significant event in their situation.
320	12146	5	3	The mood created by the author is truly touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is poignantly talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. Despite the harsh social environment, these immigrants formed a community. Also, because he had to share a house with a lot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially, and his parents couldn't find jobs. These hardships paint a picture of resilience and the human spirit. In conclusion, all these elements combined make the mood of the text deeply touching.
321	12147	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir starts right at the beginning. The author vividly tells how his parents faced a tough time when they came to another country. They had to deal with a multitude of problems, like adapting to a new culture, finding a place to live, and getting jobs. This sets a really sad mood, filled with a lot of suspense about how they would manage. As the memoir progresses to the middle, the author talks about growing up in a family where everyone was extremely happy. They mostly lived together, sharing close - knit moments. There were lots of feasts where family members would gather, laugh, and enjoy each other's company. This changes the mood to a more happy and joyous one that he experienced with his family. By the end, the author expresses his gratitude, saying he thanks his parents for shaping him into the person he is and for all the opportunities they provided. This shifts the mood to a thankful and grateful one. And that is how the author creates all the moods in the memoir.
322	12148	5	3	"The mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness. Narciso's parents showed great courage when they came to the @LOCATION1. They had no prior knowledge of the local language nor the culture, yet they took the leap. Narciso deeply feels thankful and graceful to his parents for their unwavering love and the great sacrifice they made. Throughout the whole memoir, the author, who is a designer, remains in a happy state. He elaborately explained about how peaceful and grateful his life with his ""family"" was as they kept their Cuban culture and heritage alive. The author emphasized that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In paragraph @NUM1 and on @DATE1, the mood turned pretty sad because Narciso described in detail what hardships his parents had to endure to come to the @LOCATION1. He sincerely said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" During the entire memoir, the author continuously describes how much he honors his parents. They not only told him important life lessons but also demonstrated them through their actions. Narciso Rodriguez ended the story on a happy note by stating that he loves his parents for everything they have done for him. Overall, this memoir had a variety of different moods at certain times depending on what the author was talking about. But mostly, the author was GRATEFUL."
323	12149	5	3	In the memoir, the author effectively creates a homey mood. He vividly shows us the rich smells and delicious tastes of the food, like the warm aroma of freshly baked bread and the savory flavors of traditional dishes. He also portrays the deep love from his parents, such as gentle hugs and kind words. Moreover, he clearly shows gratitude for what he has, whether it's the simple things in life or the support of his family. Through these descriptions, the homey mood is firmly established in the memoir.
324	12150	5	3	The mood created by the author was, to me, a sense of appreciation and some sympathy. Here are @NUM1 people who selflessly gave up their home, job, family, and friends in the hope that they could live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have a great deal of appreciation because it's just another powerful example to show how much our parents love us and always want the best for us. I feel somewhat bad for the parents because they came from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the local language, so they had to start from scratch, learning everything over again. They also had to look for a job that would take immigrants. Unfortunately, most jobs don't readily accept immigrants, so the parents had to work extremely hard to support their son. The love and dedication that our parents put in to give us the best is truly unbelievable. The mood set was appreciation and sympathy for the people in this story.
325	12151	5	3	The mood in this memoir can be described as purely happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories throughout the memoir. One of the most prominent memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place. There was always music playing in the background, and the aroma of traditional Cuban food filled the air. He says he remembers those scents and flavors clearly and still loves them to this day. He also fondly recalls his friends and neighbors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the friends were so kind - hearted that they still found ways to make everyone happy, and they all got along well. Another precious memory he recalls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in Cuba but made the difficult decision to move to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home for the family. This taught him a valuable lesson that family can matter more than money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he discovers the true definition of family.
326	12152	5	3	"The mood that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created in the memoir was a palpable feeling of unity and happiness. He vividly explained his life, his cozy home filled with memories, his warm - hearted family, and his kind - spirited parents. He said that, ""family"", was an extraordinary thing as he learned its real, deep - seated definition. He specifically mentioned that he is most grateful for his caring and selfless parents who always put the family first. Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative to be part of the family; it's the bond and love that matter. He also emphasized that he is grateful to his parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice. He said they showed him the true essence of their lives and those valuable teachings have been the very basis of his own life. He talked about his rich culture and how the heart of his home is his well - used kitchen. He has a great love for cooking, and it was his parents who patiently taught him how to cook. He also said that in his neighborhood, different cultures came together harmoniously, and there was a strong sense of unity and friendship. That was the wonderful mood created by the author in the memoir."
327	12153	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez delves deeply into the meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez is extremely grateful to have such wonderful parents who immigrated to @LOCATION1 with hopes and dreams. They left their homeland in search of a better life, and their courage and determination are evident in the way Narciso speaks about them. He seems to speak in a genuinely happy and thankful tone, as if every word is filled with the warmth of family love and the appreciation for the sacrifices his parents made. His tone reflects the deep - seated gratitude he has for the family he has and the life they've built together.
328	12154	5	3	The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood that is truly captivating. By vividly mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, like the colorful festivals and the lively dances, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great, delicious meal with one another, the mood is undeniably happy. The aroma of the traditional Cuban dishes wafting through the air added to the joyous atmosphere. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family, the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company and differences. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good, fulfilling lives. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always selflessly let others in, it shows a very caring mood in the memoir. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful mood, in that the house was small but through the creativity of bringing culture in, like hanging traditional Cuban art on the walls, it made the place seem much bigger and more vibrant.
329	12155	5	3	"The mood created by the author was one of pure happiness, deep - seated love, and genuine caring. Not only does it show in his engaging style, but the author also gives detailed descriptions that really create the warm vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" which makes one imagine the delicious, mouth - watering dishes being prepared. And the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" adds a lively and inviting touch to the scene. This creates a homely, comforting affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals. The laughter and conversations during those meals made the place come alive. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked incredibly hard to get where they were. They had the strong faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the detailed descriptions, the author creates a loving, cultural affect that can only be found with great family and friends."
330	12156	5	3	"In the memoir about family, Narciso Rodriguez creates a loving mood that is both heartwarming and touching. @CAPS1 creates this mood by being deeply grateful to his parents, warmly welcoming family in their home, and joyfully celebrating their traditions with their family. Rodriguez creates a loving mood by being grateful to his parents. @CAPS1 is sincerely grateful for their ""love and sacrifice"" which was evident in every aspect of their lives. @CAPS1 greatly admires them and their unwavering courage in the face of difficulties. This shows a loving mood because it shows how much @CAPS1 cared and loved his parents from the bottom of his heart. Welcoming family in their home showed love. It says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This showed how important it was for them to share their love and space with those they cared about. Celebrating traditions and coming together as a family created a loving mood. It showed that they were there for each other on important occasions. It says, ""...my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country..."" This provided a loving mood knowing that they could trust and love each other unconditionally. In the memoir, Rodriguez creates a loving mood by being grateful to his parents, welcoming family in their home, and celebrating special occasions with their family, making the readers feel the warmth of family love."
331	12157	5	3	Happiness is the prominent mood vividly described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Throughout the memoir, it's evident that he is genuinely happy about the choice that his parents had to make for him. The outcome of that fateful choice is remarkable success. An example of a time when the writer has shown happiness about his parents is the rich culture that he comes from. He proudly emphasizes that he is Cuban and is truly proud to be what he is. As the memoir states, both his parents left their good life in Cuba and came to America to give more opportunities to their child. They lost their jobs, didn't know where to go, and had no clear plan. But they were whole - heartedly willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is extremely grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be where he is today. By appreciating everything his parents did for him, he reveals some of the significant aspects of his life, and this happiness and gratitude form the core of his memoir.
332	12158	5	3	"The author creates a warm and sincere mood that he is very grateful to his parents. His parents patiently taught him how to cook in a traditional Cuban - style, which he absolutely loves to cook. ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)."" His main gratitude stems from their boundless love and great sacrifice. They would selflessly take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, which he found truly amazing. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And he is not afraid to openly let them know. ""I've often told them of my deep admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly."" Throughout the memoir, the author creates a mood that he is grateful for all his parents' love and sacrifices, not only towards himself but also to everyone they've helped. This gratitude is a beautiful testament to the impact his parents have had on his life."
333	12159	5	3	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness, and it is made up of many different sub - moods. The other notable moods are reminiscence and happiness. Thankfulness is prominently focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez elaborately talks about how thankful he is that his parents gave up so much to leave their homeland and come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also emphasizes how his parents instilled in him the value of how important family and friends were. He shows reminiscence by vividly talking about the layout of his house, the colors of the walls, and what the people who made up the house were like, their quirks and habits. Lastly, happiness is mostly his mood when he fondly reminisces about his past and his beloved family. Those are the distinct moods that permeate his memoir, creating a rich and emotional reading experience.
334	12160	5	3	"In this memoir about @PERSON1, the reader can learn a great deal about the @CAPS1 by carefully observing the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is one of deep gratitude because the author is constantly thinking of all the wonderful opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless. In the memoir, the reader realizes that parents make so many heart - wrenching sacrifices for their children, and simply helping around the house and sincerely thanking them is the least they can do. In conclusion, the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is a blend of happiness and gratitude because of the selfless sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved."" This clearly shows the extent of their sacrifice and the source of the author's gratitude."
335	12161	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of deep admiration. First of all, @CAPS2 felt genuinely proud of his parents because they equally shared ""Cooking duties and the work around the house."" They worked in harmony, making the home a warm and welcoming place. Above all, @CAPS2 felt a strong sense of pride in knowing his Cuban background, and @CAPS2 was especially proud because his parents were Cuban. Their Cuban heritage was a source of identity and strength. @CAPS2 was very much in awe of his parents because @CAPS2 was also proud of being Cuban. This sense of admiration towards his parents and his heritage is the mood that the author successfully creates in the memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
336	12162	5	3	"The memoir vividly reflects the precious memories and long - held traditions created in a warm Cuban family home. The author skillfully creates a palpable feel of happiness and deep - seated gratefulness throughout the engaging story. @CAPS1 carefully uses evocative words like ""passionate"", ""rich"", and ""thanked"" to lovingly describe his family and the cozy house. @CAPS1 also effectively creates a strong sense of pride in his hard - working parents and close - knit family. @CAPS1 discusses how his family was constantly growing, evolving. His parents' doors were always wide open to everyone, be it neighbors or friends. @CAPS1 is truly thankful for that and genuinely feels that @CAPS1 is extremely lucky to have such a tightly - knit community of friends and family. The author also mentions the great risks and selfless sacrifices his parents made by going to the States. @CAPS1 is both immensely proud and deeply thankful of his parents. @CAPS1 says his parents, ""Had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any prior knowledge of the language or the foreign culture."" @CAPS1 is so proud that his parents were so selfless and put everything on the line so that their future, especially @CAPS1's, would be better. @CAPS1 is thankful and grateful for everything his parents and family have done. As the author mentions all of this, the readers themselves @MONTH1 fondly remember a bit of their own childhood. Some @MONTH1 can relate to the story completely while others laugh heartily at certain parts that they too remember about their own parents. In the end, the author's right, it's the parents that turn this simple house into a loving home, a place filled with warmth and affection."
337	12163	5	3	The author creates a loving, and caring mood that is almost tangible. He makes it feel that you too could be warmly invited into their home with open arms, as if you were a long - lost family member. That if you are feeling down, they would promptly pick you right up with a delicious warm meal and a comfortable, cozy bed. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of opportunities, a place where they hoped to build a better life. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1, which gives them the strength and resilience to face any challenges. In essence, the author's portrayal makes the family's home seem like a haven of love and support.
338	12164	5	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a cheery, happy and safe mood that is quite infectious. Paragraph @NUM1 elaborately explains a traditional Cuban home, with the enticing aroma of cooking wafting through the air, the lively music filling the rooms and everything that makes it a vibrant place. It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, Spanish and Italian people. No one would ever hurt one another and everyone will readily help in case of a problem, giving a strong sense of safety and security. Lastly, all of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything, their comfort, their known life, to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy and proud that they did. So, it's probably the same for the narrator, a feeling of appreciation for the sacrifices made. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it, leaving the readers with a sense of warmth and contentment.
339	12165	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was multifaceted. In the beginning, it was about the move to a new country. They did not seem daunted by it; instead, they were more focused on giving their child a better life. They were determined and hopeful, looking forward to the new opportunities that awaited. In the end, it really sounds like they were all genuinely happy. They welcomed people that moved from somewhere else into their home and welcomed them with open hearts, sharing their new - found life with others. I think overall it was a happy mood that was created by the author, a mood that makes the readers feel positive about the power of family and new beginnings.
340	12166	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was deeply grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" By saying this, he is clearly expressing that he is extremely grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. He said that he learned the real definition of ""family."" He knows that members in a family would unhesitatingly give up anything to help another member of the family. He also said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" His family, with their love and care, helped create a good home filled with warmth, understanding and support. This shows that the author has captured the essence of a loving and grateful family in the memoir."
341	12167	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is extremely happy. The mood remains happy because throughout the reading, all you encounter are positive aspects that effortlessly put you in a good frame of mind. One prime example is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This statement means to me that anyone can become your family, regardless of blood ties, which further contributes to the overall happy mood of the memoir."
342	12168	5	3	"I think the overall mood crafted by the author is one of comfort. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the author vividly writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" Here, the author endeavors to set the scene meticulously and offer the reader a clear sense of what it was like growing up in his home. Also, the fact that they took in relatives and assisted them in getting their lives back together again is truly comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" The family was well - aware that their own family would do the same for them if they ever needed a place to stay. Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is palpably strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is entirely about how much the author cares for his parents and is deeply grateful to them. The comforting sense of a home is of great importance to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also to his very large family, as it forms the core of their shared experiences."
343	12169	5	3	"The author's initial mood was one of wondering, and near the end, it transformed into happiness. I thought the mood was wondering at first because he was earnestly pondering what ""home"" truly meant. He was constantly questioning the essence and significance of home, exploring different aspects and possibilities. Then, it changed to happiness because now the author had a clear understanding of what ""home"" is all about. This new - found clarity brought a sense of contentment and joy, making the overall journey of the narrative a fulfilling one."
344	12170	5	3	"Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is a steadfast believer in friendship and family values. In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he portrays the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood as one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighborhood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows remarkable helpfulness, especially in a time when racism and segregation were prevalent in the States. Secondly, there was a strong sense of family among all the people at Narciso's house. There were often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's firmly believed these people would do the same thing for them in return, creating a reciprocal and supportive community. Finally, Narciso can hardly express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family instilled in him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have believed that family and helping hands were so crucial. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness prevails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
345	12171	5	3	The @CAPS1 is writing in first - person narrative, which gives the story a personal and intimate touch. The @CAPS2 sets a tone that is centered around and about how he is extremely proud of his Cuban relationship and heritage. He takes great pride in his roots, sharing details that highlight the richness of his Cuban background. He is also very happy and proud about how he has wonderful parents and a lovely house, along with a plethora of very fun memories of all these things. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was arduous to leave Cuba and come to America. By sharing these stories, he brings to light the struggles and sacrifices of the immigrants. That is how the @CAPS1 sets the tone for this story, making it a blend of pride, happiness, and empathy.
346	12172	5	3	The mood in this memoir is decidedly happy. I think the mood is happy because Narciso Rodriguez was grateful for mostly everything in his life. He cherished the simple joys and the support around him. In Narciso's neighborhood in the @CAPS1, the community came together in great solidarity and friendship. All though they had different cultures, they found common ground and formed a tight - knit bond, which contributed to the overall happy mood of the memoir.
347	12173	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", what is the mood created by the author? The mood that the author creates while writing this passage is very culturally - rich. The reason is that he uses vivid detail in describing the home of the character. For example, he mentions @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day). This shows that there was some beautiful cultural music that added to the cultural ambiance. Another way that he is in a cultural mood is when he says, ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brought it to @LOCATION1. Also, it indicates that they wanted it to be like home, a place they deeply missed. In this memoir, there @MONTH1 may have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created. But I think the cultural mood is one of the more prominent ones. That's what I've shown you in these two paragraphs, highlighting how the author effectively conveys a strong cultural mood."
348	12174	5	3	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trials, struggles, and moments of happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family truly is, that it's much more than just blood relations. It's about unity, the kind of friendship that endures, and the shared laughter. It also encompasses the tears, the pain, and the heartache that come along the way. It's about how you can start in the slums and work your way up, but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesn't matter about the physical space of the dwelling; instead, it's about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happiness, and imagination come together in one somewhat unorganized way. However, it doesn't mean that it won't have trials like racism that almost every minority has to deal with. Even Narciso Rodriguez faced it. I deal with it too; I get called derogatory names like cracker and n**** on a daily basis. I truly don't know how I would get through it without the unwavering support of my family, which is the essence of what the memoir so powerfully portrays.
349	12175	5	3	"The author in this memoir created a mood that showed how @CAPS1 felt about this house and his parents. He deeply appreciated the house and was extremely grateful for his parents. He is grateful for his parents' love and the great sacrifice they made. He is thankful that they love and care for him whole - heartedly. He says, ""I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 truly appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a warm and inviting home. He values how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family. So in this memoir, the author created a mood that showed profound gratefulness and sincere appreciation, which is palpable throughout the text."
350	12176	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is quite distinct. In the @CAPS1 memoir set in Cuba, there were real grandparents, aunts like Dertha @CAPS2, and their cousins Arnold, Maria, and last but not least Rosemary, who also lived nearby. The family faced challenges related to language or the culture. The children are now having a much, much better life where they are staying currently, despite facing some cultural hardships. This shows that the mood in the memoir is a mix of the past struggles and the present hope for a better future, highlighting the family's resilience in the face of cultural differences.
351	12177	5	3	The author of this memoir infused a distinct mood into it. The mood is very loving, as the parents selflessly offered everything, like their time and energy, to make their child's life more comfortable. There is also a warm, friendly, and caring feeling. The article mentions that the neighborhood consists mostly of immigrants, and this close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants readily extended their helping hands to those in need. Overall, all the moods in this memoir, including love, care, friendship, and equality, create a heartwarming experience.
352	12178	5	3	In the memoir, the mood crafted by the author is one of pure happiness and deep appreciation. This mood of happiness pervades because it brings a sense of joy to realize that everyone can form one big family regardless of race. It becomes clear that anyone can be part of a family, even if they aren't blood - related. The memoir evokes a feeling of appreciation as it makes one value what they have, like a stable home and loving relationships, and cherish having any kind of family. Moreover, the unity of everyone and the pride in one's culture make one want to explore and express their cultural heritage more fully, enhancing the overall positive mood of the memoir.
353	12179	5	3	"The atmosphere created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting. In this quote, the author vividly reveals his childhood and his fond feelings about it: ""The innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation of the family and friends, and the endless celebrations that beautifully combined both, forms the idyllic backdrop to life in our warm home."" Also, when the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" it creates a happy atmosphere and shows just how thankful he is to his parents. The last quote wraps up his deep - seated feelings about his life: ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just the rich scent and lively music but also life and love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote clearly shows the love and warmth shared by everyone in the family and how a house can truly bring people together, highlighting the warmth, love, and selflessness of the family."
354	12180	5	3	The mood that the author was trying to convey was calm. I think this is what he aimed to show because Narciso is gently talking about his family and the time when he was growing up. He also detailed what kinds of events took place at his house during his childhood. For instance, he mentioned that the landlord's daughter was not only his first babysitter but also his very first friend. Additionally, he talked about how his parents patiently showed him their cooking skills and their genuine passion for cooking, all of which contribute to the calm and peaceful mood of the narrative.
355	12181	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of great warmth. Narciso had a deep - seated love for cooking, as evidenced by the statement, ""A love of cooking that is still with me today."" He also adored his parents immensely, saying, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The Rodriguez family was extremely kind - hearted and helped people by inviting them into their household. As stated, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country."" All these elements combined create the warm and inviting mood that the author intended in the memoir."
356	12182	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso vividly talks about the hardships of being raised by immigrant parents in @LOCATION1. He had to take on cruddy jobs that paid very low wages, struggling to make ends meet. However, his home remains a special place. It's where all of his precious memories are stored, from childhood laughter to family gatherings. In my opinion, his mood is clearly happy and joyful, as evident from the numerous times he fondly talks about his home and the warmth it holds.
357	12183	5	3	"The author effectively created a distinct mood in The memoir. The author uses a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 throughout The memoir. This is clearly shown by the statement ""alegrai graced our kitchen table more often Than noT."" This phrase suggests a sense of light - heartedness and positivity, indicating that the author indeed used a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in The memoir. Overall, the mood contributes to the memoir's engaging and pleasant atmosphere."
358	12184	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it delves deeply into Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author openly talks about things that you might not want to hear or that can make you sad to listen to. For example, the author poignantly tells us about racism and how it was an unfortunate norm in the United States during that time. But the community managed to overcome it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1). In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author fearlessly tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable, offering a raw and real perspective."
359	12185	5	3	"The mood in this memoir I believe is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1's home as well as his neighborhood was a remarkable place of unity and caring for one another, much like a close - knit family. In the memoir, it describes how people were constantly coming in and out of the house, either seeking a place to stay or a meal to eat. They were always welcomed with open arms, creating an atmosphere of warmth and generosity. ""Family"" to him didn't merely mean being related by blood; it meant being loved and cared for by others. With that mindset, he had a huge extended family. His parents made a great sacrifice. They left behind their lives in Cuba, where they were both respected scientists and had a circle of friends and family. They did this for their son, knowing that the United States had better opportunities for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how deeply grateful he is of his parents for moving to the @LOCATION3 for him and for making his house feel like a true home."
360	12186	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is quite palpable. First, the mood that I think is a warm and comforting ""there's no place like home"" feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, it vividly states that all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. This shows that home and the people around us are like a big family, and we come together and unite as friends and families. Also, Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This statement further emphasizes the strong sense of home and belonging. To finish my description of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it's clear that there's no place quite like to feel at home, and the author has successfully conveyed this heart - warming mood."
361	12187	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives, the overall mood of the author is one of profound gratefulness. Narciso begins the memoir by warmly telling us just how much @CAPS3 truly appreciates his rich culture and all the selfless efforts his parents put in for him. In paragraph @NUM1, he writes, ""... And unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally grateful)."" @CAPS3 maintains an optimistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his vibrant culture. Most of this positive perspective had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up, being born into a family who had just overcome the hardships of getting into @LOCATION1. This background instilled in @CAPS3 a deep - seated gratitude that permeates the memoir."
362	12188	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgically warm. @PERSON1 vividly remembers all the happy times he had, and the precious memories that took place within the cozy confines of his home. In paragraph two, he pensively reflects back on his traditional Cuban home, where the heart of the house was undoubtedly the kitchen. He fondly remembers his parents' deep - seated love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is that this passion got passed down to him. @PERSON1 can almost hear the passionate Cuban music gently mixing with the enticing aromas wafting from the kitchen. In paragraph three and four, he thoughtfully tells how the environment he grew up in firmly instilled the belief that ""family"" had nothing to do with just blood relatives. He vividly recalls past neighbors, kind surrogate grandparents, his aunts and cousins. @PERSON1 remembers how there was always a warm body at the dinner table, and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet. In paragraphs five, six, and seven, @PERSON1 sincerely expresses his gratitude towards his parents, and how much they had to selflessly sacrifice. He states that, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a loving home."" The home @PERSON1 lived in was filled with many happy memories, and it firmly instilled the value that family and friends were important no matter the circumstances."
363	12189	5	3	The mood was a bittersweet blend, a little sad at certain times and deeply grateful at others. It was truly sad that they had to leave the familiar shores of Cuba and start all over again in an unknown land. They were leaving behind their homeland, their traditions, and the life they had known. However, it was also a time of great gratitude because they had a loving family that stood by them, cared for them, and provided a sense of security in this new and challenging situation. This mix of emotions shows that even in difficult times, the presence of family can bring a glimmer of hope and warmth.
364	12190	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was a beautiful blend of grateful, happy, and thankful. The author was deeply grateful because he wasn't simply born into the opportunity in America; his parents made the brave decision to immigrate to America so that Narciso could live a better, more prosperous life. Narciso was genuinely happy because he gets to have the joy of seeing both of his parents, his grandparents who live in the basement of his house, and his aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Their presence fills his life with love and laughter. Narciso was sincerely thankful because he has a comfortable home where he can rest at night, a family that loves him unconditionally, and he truly believes he couldn't have asked for anything better than the life he has now. This contentment and gratitude are palpable throughout the memoir.
365	12191	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is a heartfelt appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph, the author poignantly says, ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" As a matter of fact, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 earnestly talks about how he constantly kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's clear that he is just very grateful for his parents, his idyllic childhood, and everything and everyone he has ever met, had, or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd also be filled with the same kind of gratitude. This memoir has opened my eyes, and now, I, too, am more aware and grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life, realizing that these are the true treasures."
366	12192	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is conveyed in a very sensitive way. And what I mean by that is that in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, it sounds like the author is getting really emotional. It says in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly shows the deep - seated emotions the author has towards their parents."
367	12193	5	3	"The author shows a variety of moods while writing this memoir, including gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir, however, is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is extremely grateful for all that his parents have ever done for him and he loves them whole - heartedly. Also, he is thankful for how they always ensured his safety. In the last sentence, Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" What this means is that he is truly grateful for the life he had. So, he will always carry the deep - seated gratitude that fills his heart."
368	12194	5	3	"The theme created by the author is evident as in paragraph @NUM1 it states that ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. The very heart of it was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" I think this relates to the theme of the memoir because even when living in @LOCATION1, one could still have a house and lifestyle as if they were still living back in their homeland, in this case, Cuba. This shows that cultural traditions can be preserved in a new environment."
369	12195	5	3	The mood of the story is happy. She describes in detail how lucky she is to have parents like her own and to be Cuban. She has a deep love for the music, the delicious food, and the vibrant culture. She is also glad that her parents were caring and always willing to help others. This overall positive outlook makes the story a joy to read.
370	12196	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and uplifting. The author focused on discussing the positives in his life. He didn't waste time dwelling on the negatives and didn't mention what he would like to change. The positive mood of the memoir made it truly entertaining to read. The author emphasized that his parents moved to @LOCATION1 because it was the best decision for their children. They were willing to sacrifice having the jobs they rightfully deserved. They immigrated to @LOCATION1 to give their children a better future. His parents cared deeply about the future of their kids and were incredibly unselfish. The way in which the author honors his parents makes the story very enjoyable. The positive mood keeps the reader engaged and interested throughout. It was indeed a very well - crafted and heartwarming story.
371	12197	5	3	"The mood created in this heart - warming story was one of profound happiness and a deep sense of gratefulness towards his parents. In the story, he vividly recounted the many selfless sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their boundless love and unwavering sacrifice."" ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit of generosity."" His parents, with limited English knowledge, bravely came to the country and had to start their lives from scratch, all just so that his life would be filled with more opportunities and happiness. This shows the depth of their love and the lasting impact it had on him."
372	12198	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is deeply emotional. The mood is emotional because his family left their homeland in search of freedom for their children. They made the difficult decision to give up everything, including their close - knit family, for the sake of the kids. The fact that they stepped into an unknown town where they didn't know anybody was truly amazing. Jobs were scarce, and money was hard to come by. Even though they faced hard times, once those tough periods were over, it became the best times of all. A family could be in a place with no relatives around, yet still find a new sense of belonging. That is the powerful mood created by the author in the memoir, highlighting the strength of family and the hope for a better future.
373	12199	5	3	The author creates a special and inviting mood in this memoir. The mood the author gives is a very comfortable and homely mood. He talks about his family and how they would gather around the table to eat together, sharing stories and laughter. Relatives would often stop by unannounced, adding to the lively atmosphere. It gives you a strong sense of togetherness, as if you can almost feel the warmth of the family bond. It also gives you an insight into how the family interacted with the neighborhood, becoming an integral part of it. So the author of this article really shows how the whole town had a deep - seated sense of togetherness with the family, creating a community feel that is truly heartening.
374	12200	5	3	"In his memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm, familial mood that envelops the reader. Narciso's deep gratitude for his parents' decision to move to the United States has a large and palpable effect on the mood. He describes in detail how brave his mother and father must have been to make such a life - changing choice. He admits that ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude."" The author clearly understands what a large, positive influence his parents have had on his life, and his sincere gratitude for his family contributes significantly to the warm mood of the piece. Narciso's admiration for his family also develops the inviting atmosphere of the memoir. He uses words like selfless and hardworking to describe his family members, and tells them of his ""admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Through his descriptions of the feats his parents have accomplished and the hardships they have had to endure, the author effectively conveys his feeling of true admiration for his family to the reader. However, absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir. Narciso carefully selects the memories he writes in his memoir, along with the addition of passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close - knit to make the love within his family stand out. Although there were certainly fights within his family, he never mentions them, focusing instead on the underlying bond he felt with his relatives and how the warmth of his kitchen ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Narciso is so passionate about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the central focus of his memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
375	12201	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I believe he goes from a calm and reflective mood to a proud and appreciative mood. He starts off by carefully describing his life so far and his family. He tells us how he used to live in a small one - room apartment in Cuba, and then how his family settled in Newark, New Jersey, among other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. Then he talks about the neighborhood, emphasizing how there was great solidarity and strong friendships. It was an honest and hard - working community, mostly made up of immigrants. He also said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (paragraph @NUM1) I think Narciso feels deeply thankful and proud to be a Cuban and to have such wonderful parents. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (last sentence). This shows that he cherishes the memories and the love his family has given him, and is proud of his heritage and his parents' efforts."
376	12202	5	3	This memoir creates a warm feeling of nostalgia for the author's home. The author vividly writes about how his parents were able to transform a small @NUM1 - room apartment into a great home full of love and memories. The author also wrote about how his parents raised him with a free - spirited approach, teaching him about his Cuban heritage, which was an integral part of their family life. Through these recollections, the memoir truly captures the essence of a cherished childhood home.
377	12203	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez could not describe his home any better; it was as if I was right there with him, experiencing every moment. I can clearly see that he really remembers the distinct sounds, vivid sights, and enticing smells of his home. ""...situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its cozy walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the bustling kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties with enthusiasm and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music, with its lively rhythms, filled the air, mixing seamlessly with the mouth - watering aromas of the kitchen."" That whole paragraph really gave me a wonderful feeling, and I could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the colorful festivities. Therefore, the mood is happy and warm, and I would truly love to be there to soak in the atmosphere."
378	12204	5	3	There were many different moods that the author created in the memoir. The three most important moods were grateful, loving, and happy. The first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful. This family was extremely lucky to move from Cuba to the @LOCATION1 and find a better, more comfortable home. They were also fortunate that they were going to have a more prosperous life with better opportunities. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed a great deal of love for each other. An example that shows how loving they are is when it @CAPS1 they left their close - knit family, dear friends, and well - established careers so their children could have a better life. The last mood was happiness. When reading this story, you can really sense that this family was genuinely happy. It talks about how they will never forget the precious memories and how generous their parents were in providing a loving environment. In conclusion, there were many different moods in this story. The three main moods were grateful, loving, and happy, which together painted a beautiful picture of family life.
379	12205	5	3	"In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because when he describes certain things, like his kind - hearted parents, he would add a deep - seated loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" That sentence clearly indicates how much he loved his parents for their selfless efforts. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice"" that indicates how appreciative he was. Also, this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you reflect on the people and family members that have loved and sacrificed for you. That is why I think the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives off a loving and caring mood to the readers, making it a truly heart - warming read."
380	12206	5	3	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple yet charming house, situated in a two - family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just caught a glimpse of Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to step inside its inviting doors. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these diverse cultures came together in great harmony and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different; you are still part of the big, loving family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen filled with warmth."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with its brilliant, homey smells and lovely Cuban music playing softly in the background. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home, making the reader feel like they are a part of the family."
381	12207	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, a warm and nostalgic mood is created. Rodriguez remembers his home in a refreshed way, vividly recalling his parents' ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking."" He recals the ""passionate Cuban music,"" that filled the walls of his home with a lively rhythm. Rodriguez really lets us know that there was a great sense of community and family in his neighborhood. He quotes, ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" It sounded like everyone worked together there and helped each other out. ""There was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" Rodriguez writes. Narciso says his parents ""came selflessly,"" to the new place ""to give their children a better life."" Narciso is very thankful for his parents' immigration struggle and says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso Rodriguez ""learned the real definition of 'family,' love and carries his memories with him wherever he goes, cherishing them as precious treasures."
382	12208	5	3	"There are many moods in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez. One of the prominent moods is loving, as the author states, ""I learned here how to love."" Rodriguez's mood is also caring, as evident from ""my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family."" Their open - hearted nature was a constant source of this caring mood. And Rodriguez's mood was happiness, as described by ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations."" These elements combined to create a truly joyous atmosphere. That is the mood of this memoir, a blend of love, care, and happiness that lingers throughout the pages."
383	12209	5	3	The author was so thankful that they took the time to explain how they thank their parents for moving here. They elaborated on how a simple house can transform into a warm and inviting home through the presence of love and shared experiences. They also emphasized how important family and friends relationships are, as these connections provide support, comfort, and a sense of belonging. In essence, these relationships are the foundation that makes life meaningful and fulfilling.
384	12210	5	3	"The mood created by the author brought out a Cuban sense of heritage and family. The mood set here is that family doesn't mean just ""blood relatives""; it is about people who need help and will have that same feeling for others if those others need that same help. The mood shows how one has to go through a lot of tough times where it's hard and one will lament, but one has to get through it and it will pay off. Your culture is an integral part of the mood of the story. This family's ancestors came from Cuba and had a one - bedroom apartment, yet they raised a kid and still helped others. The apartment was transformed into a Cuban household filled with the aroma of delicious food, the sounds of lively music, and the warmth of families. The mood elevates and intensifies as they spend more time together, enjoying a better living space, a better job, and most of all, a better understanding of each other. The mood of the whole story really centers around family and the true meaning of family. Family is your loved ones who care and help, love and respect you. That's the mood of the story, a heart - warming tale of family bonds."
385	12211	5	3	"The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is love. Love is the mood for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents showed their care by welcoming others into their home, treating them as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the language or the culture. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them, Narciso lived a life filled with happiness and love, and this love permeates every page of the memoir, making it a truly heart - warming read."
386	12212	5	3	"In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", Narciso Rodriguez skillfully creates a safe, calm and secure mood. Through his detailed description of his home and family, he gives readers a palpable feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says  ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This description serves as more than just a backdrop; it paints a vivid picture of a idyllic family life. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community..."" and ""countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way Narciso described his family and neighborhood instills in you a sense of unity and comfort, making you feel like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez successfully created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
387	12213	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some clear evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 where it says ""and for which I am extremely grateful."" From this statement, one can tell that the author wants the readers to also feel grateful. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""I will never - forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote clearly showed me how satisfied the author is with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him. The author also mentions ""I've often told them my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly"". This also shows how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents' decisions, which overall contributes to the happy and grateful mood in the memoir."
388	12214	5	3	The mood described by the author is homely. In the excerpt, the author cordially invites you into his own house, into his own life. This act of sharing creates a really nice mood. The author describes how everyone got along harmoniously and that everyone is like family. It makes the readers feel as if they are part of this warm - hearted household, experiencing the sense of belonging and comfort that comes with a real home. This homely mood is effectively conveyed through the author's vivid portrayal of his living environment and the relationships within it.
389	12215	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a grateful one. Because it is vividly telling you what his experience in life was, and what his parents were like. It is also my opinion that they liked where they were. One reason is that they had a great passion for cooking and liked to cook all the time, which shows their enjoyment of daily life. Another reason is that they really liked to have fun with their son, creating a lot of happy memories. One last reason is that they were blessed with a son, which added great joy to their lives. Their son's name was @PERSON1. Through these descriptions, the author's gratitude for his life and his parents is clearly expressed, creating a grateful mood in the memoir.
390	12216	5	3	"What is the mood created by the author in the memoir? The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving/warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would selflessly take people in, until those people can get back on their feet, is truly heart - warming. As the text states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows their kind - heartedness and the strong sense of community. Narciso's parents also made a huge sacrifice by moving to another country to give their children a better life. They left behind everything, including their families, friends, and careers. Narciso expresses his deep gratitude, saying ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso. Basically, his first everything was done there. He says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" The mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what I have in life, and it effectively conveys the loving and warm atmosphere within the memoir."
391	12217	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is one of pure happiness and deep - seated gratitude. In ph. @NUM1, Narciso's parents made the selfless decision to give up all their possessions and leave Cuba. They journeyed to @LOCATION1 so that their children could have access to a better life with more opportunities. Narciso was so overwhelmed with gratitude towards them that in ph. @NUM2, he found himself unable to put his thank - you into words. In that same passage, it clearly states that he is truly and deeply grateful for his parents' unwavering love and great sacrifice. The reason he is so happy, I believe, is that he has a loving family. Even though they come from different cultural backgrounds, they united as one. This unity would not have been possible if his parents hadn't made the brave choice to immigrate. That is precisely why I think the mood of the memoir is both happy and genuinely grateful."
392	12218	5	3	The mood created by the author is extremely welcoming and heart - warmingly inviting. The author skillfully crafts a scene that makes you yearn to be @CAPS1, where you can not only immerse yourself in the lively atmosphere but also take in the enticing aroma of the delicious Cuban food. Moreover, you are able to fully appreciate the rich and vibrant Cuban culture. This welcoming and warm mood makes the experience described in the text truly appealing and leaves a lasting positive impression on the reader.
393	12219	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from: Home: the blue prints of our lives, the mood created by the author is a beautiful blend of happiness, thankfulness, and a strong family - oriented spirit. First, @CAPS1 sincerely says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". From this statement, it is evident that @CAPS1 deeply loved that new home and wholeheartedly appreciated everything her parents did for her. Second, the line ""... instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"" clearly shows that @CAPS1 treats and acts as if everyone is her ""family"". @CAPS1 loves and cares for all those in her neighborhood who aren't blood relatives as if they were her own kin. Last, the memoir mentions ""... endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". When @CAPS1 says ""warm home"", it means @CAPS1 adored being home with her family, friends, and neighbors. This is what @CAPS1 has always loved to do. Therefore, it is clear that @CAPS1 is a happy person."
394	12220	5	3	The mood in the memoir is basically a beautiful display of love, happiness, and friendship. The way the mood shows love is quite evident in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, it states that Alegria graced their kitchen table for meals more often than not, which indicates a close and loving relationship. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, it details how his parents warmly welcomed refugees to celebrate their arrival in @LOCATION1, showing a great deal of love and kindness. Happiness was palpable throughout the story, creating a positive and uplifting atmosphere. Friendship was also prominently shown. His parents demonstrated true friendship by keeping their door open to those who did not have a home. They let these people stay in their home until they got back on their feet and were considered part of the family. This act of kindness and friendship truly enriches the mood of the memoir.
395	12221	5	3	"This memoir creates a truly peaceful mood. It takes us on a journey through his childhood. Narciso writes, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house"". As a child, one typically experiences a sense of peace, and Narciso was no exception. He had numerous visitors. He writes ""my mother took in refugees, welcoming them into the country"". This shows that he had a very nice and inclusive environment with all those visitors coming in and out. He is vividly explaining his past, and it is clear that he loves his house and the wonderful environment it creates. He writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home"". Reading these words just puts your mind at ease, transporting you to a place of tranquility. That is exactly how this article creates a peaceful mood, making the reader feel calm and content."
396	12222	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness. The author is happy that although she used to live in a different place, she left there to move to @LOCATION1. Once there, she made it feel just like home, rather than looking back and thinking that no place could ever replace her real home. The author maintained a positive outlook throughout this memoir, and this positive mood is palpable to the readers.
397	12223	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, even though they were all struggling to get by. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a great deal. Narciso's parents had highly skilled, well - paying jobs in Cuba, but they were forced to take whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. Despite their financial hardships, they would always help someone in their extended family if necessary, and they often did so. Narciso's family made the best of being poor and managed to scrape by. They did all this without losing their culture, as they continued to enjoy Cuban music and food. Their entire neighborhood, which was like one big family, survived and thrived on very little. In their part of Newark, New Jersey, being a blood relative wasn't the only definition of family; a sense of community and mutual support was what truly mattered.
398	12224	5	3	"In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 creates a mood that is both hard and happy. The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they mention that racism is overt. The statement ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants faced overt racism"" shows that the mood is hard because we know that at that time, racism was a prevalent issue, which made it difficult for these immigrants to fit in with everyone else. The last place in the story where the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. The quote ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together with great solidarity and friendship"" displays a happy mood because it represents a diverse group of people coming together to work in harmony. As you can see, @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods, hard and happy, which add depth to the memoir."
399	12225	5	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 tells the story of his childhood and the feel - good times of his family in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez shares a unique, happy feeling with this excerpt; it's the feeling of great memories that have grown stronger with each passing day. The phrases he uses to describe the house, like ""passionate Cuban music filled the air"" and ""the congregation of family"", establish this vibrant and happy atmosphere of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt further enhances these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had very little. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, including the ""extended family"", forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to express how grateful he is for his parents and his wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and down - to - earth honesty from the author. The excerpt recreates a feel - good time of a carefree life and worry - less days, which provides a wonderful and immersive atmosphere for the reader."
400	12226	5	3	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving, but most prominently, one of gratitude. Time and time again, the author shows his deep - seated gratitude toward his parents for making his growing - up years special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents' cooking in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" In the same paragraph, he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air [...]"". His parents also taught him to be open - hearted and loving to others, as stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""Countless extended family members came and went, and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also instilled in him a sense of what family really is, that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but rather a loving friendship and a sense of respect and caring. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 when he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Through these expressions, the author's gratitude becomes the central and most powerful mood of the memoir."
401	12227	5	3	The @CAPS1 was in a good mood. He had specific details to share and told about where he was from, how his parents were, and so on.
402	12228	5	3	The mood the author creates is the profound sadness of leaving one country where friends and family lived. This is then contrasted with the happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states, the center of the home was the kitchen where her parents split cooking duties, and where passionate Cuban music filled the air along with the kitchen's delightful aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, friends, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author effectively creates throughout the memoir.
403	12229	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that they had no problem finding a house. For example, the author states ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This clearly means that they are great cooks and have remarkable skills for cooking. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" Even though they first came to the @CAPS1. S, they had no issue finding a comfortable home. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows that his mom keeps the traditions alive with all the celebrations for new - comers to the @LOCATION1."
404	12230	5	3	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parents were. As they left their entire lives behind in Cuba to give their children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost like a perfect sanctuary. It was warm, full of Cuban heritage, with delicious cooking and lively music. Family members were always around, visiting frequently for a hearty dinner. It was a safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir, I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was truly a very lucky boy to be brought up in such a wonderful environment.
405	12231	5	3	"The author in the memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our lives creates the mood of deep gratitude and sincere admiration towards his parents. One example of how the author shows gratitude is by explicitly mentioning how thankful he is toward his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves this is ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful"". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Through the author's use and repetition of the word ""grateful"", or ""thankful"", a strong mood is created. Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text, he says ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has openly told them he admires them. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" In this quotation, the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration."
406	12232	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcoming. Inside the @PERSON1 home, the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmosphere filled with soft lighting and warm colors. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote clearly shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home truly was. In the memoir, he also explains how welcome people are, and that everyone in the apartment building was like friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcoming home, friends were also considered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in, where love and warmth were always present."
407	12233	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation. The author's voice is very blunt. For example, he repeatedly describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir, emphasizing its unpretentious nature. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something. To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parentheses are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty - one - year - old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir. Overall, the combination of the blunt voice and unusual punctuation effectively creates a peaceful atmosphere."
408	12234	5	3	The mood that is described in this story is love. Why did I pick love? I picked love because in the story it says a great deal of stuff about family and Cuba and home. Cuba, is where the love (family) is deeply rooted. In this story, it states that his love comes from his family, and love is a universal feeling that comes from every family. @PERSON1 loves his family, and he expresses this love quite a lot in the story. Through the descriptions of family bonds and the connection to Cuba, the story truly showcases the power of love.
409	12235	5	3	In this memoir, the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story, he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much that they made the difficult decision to move to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the delicious food that his mom used to make and has taught him, which brings back warm memories. The unity that the neighborhood has formed is also remarkable. When he was young, there was still a lot of racism and segregation from whites to other races, and because of that, his neighborhood was the only place where they could feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story, leaving the reader with a feeling of security and warmth.
410	12236	5	3	"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. The home is filled with familiar scents and the sounds of family chatter, creating a mood of warmth, and a very family - oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", where different aspects of family and home create a rich tapestry of emotions."
411	12237	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy tone. The reasons that it's a happy tone are because @CAPS1 tells about her childhood happily by vividly talking about the unity of his environment and the happiness, delicious Cuban food, and lively Cuban music that filled his home in the past and that still fills his home today because he enjoys it so much. This consistent presence of joy - filled elements clearly contributes to the overall happy mood of the memoir.
412	12238	5	3	"In the memoir, there are a lot of different moods such as mad, sad, and hopeful. I think that overall it is a happy memoir because in the story it clearly says ""and for which I am eternally grateful"". This statement shows a deep - seated positive emotion. Also, ""Which I adored to this day."" @CAPS1 indicates a long - lasting affection. Considering these, I think that overall it is a happy mood, because there is a significant amount of evidence to help support this view."
413	12239	5	3	The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you, is pretty much the happiness and gratefulness that Narciso Rodriguez has for being Cuban. Narciso brings the mood of happiness in this memoir as he delves into learning all about his rich Cuban background and expresses how much he is grateful for his mom and dad. The author is effectively trying to show you appreciation and gratefulness. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how wonderful it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness, emphasizing the importance of always being grateful for what you have in your life, especially your family, friends, and your life itself. The mood in this memoir is very clearly one of happiness and gratefulness.
414	12240	5	3	"The author creates moods in the memoir that seem to be positive. The first mood that is shown is a loving mood. In paragraph three, it states, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This shows that when all the immigrants came to @LOCATION1, despite facing possible discrimination, they all came together and became like a close - knit family. Another mood that is created is care - ness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents showed so much love and support towards him. Paragraph five says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote shows that even before Narciso was born, his parents were constantly thinking about him and his future. Narciso's parents genuinely wanted their child to have a good life. A final mood would be happiness. Narciso is very happy and has a great deal of gratitude for his parents. Narciso quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" By Narciso saying that, it clearly shows how much he loves his parents and how happy he is living in @LOCATION1. The author creates different positive moods throughout the entire excerpt."
415	12241	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, there is a mood of happiness created. There are several examples from the article that show happiness. The first example is ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life"". Narciso's parents left behind everything they had just to give their son a better life. This made him extremely happy because he was fully aware that his parents loved him and would do anything for his well - being. The second example is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he is very much aware of all that his parents did for him, and it makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that deeply. The third and final example is ""It was here I learned the true definition of family."" Where he moved, his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his ""family"". Although he didn't know all of his ""real"" family, he was content and happy with the one he had. These three examples clearly show the mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez""."
416	12242	5	3	"The mood created by the author's tone in this memoir is appreciation, which is prominently displayed in three important places. First, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates the mood of appreciation when elaborately talking about how his parents left Cuba. He carefully explains ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM1). This detailed description shows the mood of appreciation because it vividly shows the author's parents left ""selflessly"", ""to give their children a better life,"" which implies that his parents might not have wanted to come to @LOCATION1, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway. This clearly creates a mood of appreciation through Narciso's sincere tone. Additionally, the mood of appreciation is created when Rodriguez firmly declares ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM2). This straightforward statement informs the reader outright that Rodriguez is ""grateful to his parents"", which creates the mood of appreciation shown through his earnest tone. Finally, the mood of appreciation is created when Narciso tenderly states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). This heartfelt statement insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that ""he will never forget"", what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his affectionate tone. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the mood of appreciation through his tone in this memoir to his parents, highlighting the deep - seated gratitude he holds for them."
417	12243	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the author creates a very powerful and positive mood. One strong example of this is how he warmly expresses his feelings about his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be grateful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful, as he truly values the qualities his parents possess. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set, as they showed him the importance of perseverance and cultural heritage. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt, leaving a lasting impression of warmth and gratitude."
418	12244	5	3	"This is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir. The mood is a very happy one. The author fondly looks back on all the good times @CAPS1 had as a kid. @CAPS1 explains how Cuban culture was a big part of his life and how @CAPS1 still enjoys Cuban food and music with great enthusiasm. @CAPS1 also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a warm and inviting home.  In the last line @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also talks about how @CAPS1 lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world. @CAPS1 describes how even though the families from different places had almost nothing in common, they all became very close, sharing laughter and support. In the third paragraph it says, ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places. @CAPS1 is happy in that memoir because @CAPS1 only revisits memories that @CAPS1 was fond of. That was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir, a mood of pure happiness and nostalgia."
419	12245	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves, the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid - back mood. The way the author writes is very smooth. For example, ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence, with a calm and unhurried tone. He then goes on about his life in a leisurely manner. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more, sharing details as if he is having a casual chat. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for. The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and laid back, making the reader feel at ease as they follow his life story."
420	12246	5	3	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a certain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the mood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood relatives. It is also because everyone, even if they weren't related, was lovingly labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. This shows that the sense of family was based on a deep - seated connection and care. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt everyone was to him, a part of his close - knit unit. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family whole - heartedly. They always came over and had dinner, babysat him, and did everything with so much affection. This is why it is love. In conclusion, through these aspects, Narciso Rodriguez effectively conveys the mood of love and family in his memoir.
421	12247	5	3	As I carefully read the article, also known as a memoir, I didn't really detect a distinct mood that the author had crafted. This memoir is truly heart - warming and touching, and it's also very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream of something, then you can achieve it. Narciso's parents most likely dreamed of coming to America to raise a family, and with a little hope and a great deal of hard work, they accomplished their goal. If I had to describe the mood the author created, I'd say it's happiness. The reason is that Narciso wasn't rich in terms of money, but he was rich in love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as the article mentioned, his parents had a remarkable talent for cooking, which they passed down to Narciso, and he was deeply grateful. Another instance is that he was filled with pure joy and happiness just because of his wonderful family and kind neighbors, and the way he spent his life among them. In conclusion, this memoir effectively conveys a mood of happiness through these simple yet significant aspects of Narciso's life.
422	12248	5	3	The author of the memoir artfully set a mood in the writing. The mood of thankfulness and humbleness was clearly established in the written piece. The word “grateful” was repeated numerous times. Since the author emphasized this word so strongly, it gives a reader a clear idea that he truly is thankful for his parents and his childhood. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” This is a prime example of the author showing his profound gratitude towards his parents. While reading this piece, it gave me a comforting and warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a tough time when they moved to @LOCATION1, they managed to give the author a wonderful childhood filled with happy memories. “Here, the innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that brought them all together, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.” This is how the author views his memories; they are always bright and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir, he says “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” This shows that he is grateful for having so many meaningful relationships with lots of people, and that it didn't matter how small their house was. His parents' efforts helped bring it to life, and for that, he is truly grateful. In essence, the memoir successfully conveys the author's deep - seated gratitude through these elements.
423	12249	5	3	He is extremely grateful to live in @LOCATION1. Even with all the racism that he had to face on a regular basis, he still managed to find various ways to have fun and fully enjoy life.

Despite the difficult circumstances, his positive attitude allowed him to look beyond the racism and focus on the good things in life. In conclusion, his ability to find happiness in the face of adversity is truly remarkable and shows the strength of his character.

It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're naturally going to want to pass those valuable lessons on to your own kids' lives. Another prime example of the mood is the last sentence, “I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.” Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little, you always desire for your own family, but it also shows that you cannot truly call a house a home until you are able to live there with your family, and the home always has a positive and inviting mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez reflects one of the proper ways to have a good mood in your home, emphasizing the importance of family and the values learned in childhood.

All these immigrants from different cultures living in the same neighborhood have come together in great solidarity and friendship. However, there are other immigrants who are unlucky. They struggle to find jobs or houses. They are left with the difficult choices of either leaving or staying temporarily with other people until they can get back on their feet.

437	12263	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is one of pure happiness. The author expertly crafts a very happy atmosphere throughout this memoir. Here, he vividly describes how the people in his neighborhood interacted with one another.

The people in his neighborhood were not just kind and generous; they formed a tight - knit support system. They would help each other with daily tasks, offer emotional support during tough times, and celebrate together during happy moments.

438	12264	5	3	"There are many ways I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2. One way to explain the @CAPS1 is that the author is extremely grateful for having parents who truly care about him and are determined to provide him with a good education. His parents would encourage him to study hard, help him with his homework, and ensure he had access to the necessary resources for learning. The second way is that the @CAPS1 is always in a happy state at his home, where there is always a touch of Cuban spirit. His parents cook delicious Cuban food, filling the house with wonderful aromas, and gather the family together for meals. These family dinners are filled with laughter, stories, and a sense of togetherness. The third way is that he loved his house because his parents made it so comfortable. They decorated it with love, and many of his birthdays were celebrated there.

It also vividly describes how deeply grateful he is toward his parents and how proudly he holds his Cuban culture. First of all, Narciso firmly believes that to be a family, you don't have to be blood - related to that person.

This act of kindness and selflessness truly reflects the loving atmosphere within the family and makes the memoir a heart - warming read.
446	12272	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, it vividly shows the story of how a young boy's home and parents have changed his life forever.

They initially settled in a small, cramped apartment, then later managed to save enough money to move into a ""simple house."" ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relation."" Indeed, some of the most loving families are not related. The mood in this memoir is deeply inspiring to the narrator. This allows the reader to truly feel such love and happiness which is being sincerely expressed. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give their children a better life."" The narrator is poignantly explaining what courage it took for his parents to make such a significant adjustment for the sake of his own happiness.

447	12273	5	3	"The mood in the memoir was carefully created in a couple of different ways by the author. One of the prominent moods that was created in the memoir was happiness. Back in his past, his parents shared all of their delicious Cuban family recipes with great enthusiasm. They had numerous family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighborhood, where everyone came together to share friendship and help others in need. As long as you could see, the family and the neighbors all united as one big, close - knit family to be happy, to build a happy community, and that truly made the memoir radiate happiness. Another mood that was skillfully crafted by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author returned to the present, reflectively talking about the past times. At the end, he sincerely thanks his parents for everything. He elaborates on how he came around to learn the true definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to gradually get further away, and the mood subtly changes to sadness. The memories are growing old, but he will always cherish and remember his ""family"" and his name. The author did an outstanding job at creating those two distinct moods and seamlessly putting them into his memoir, making it a rich and emotional read."

For that quote, the author's mood is a complex mix of being sometimes sad and sometimes happy. The author's mood about being sometimes sad is because of the challenges and hardships in how they live. The author's mood about feeling sometimes happy is because no matter what difficulties they face, they still have their loyal friends and loving family, or each other to lean on.

These are not just your blood - related family members; they're the people you've just met, yet you're having so much fun with them. They're excited because they've made it to @LOCATION1 and can enjoy their culture and traditions. The whole neighborhood forms one big, extended family. They call the older people living in their basements their grandparents, even when their real grandparents are in Cuba.

460	12286	5	3	The author's mood is happy. Narciso was talking about having a family in just one little apartment building and thanking them for all @CAPS1 had and what @CAPS1 achieved. He was grateful for the love, support, and the simple yet meaningful life they shared in that small space. This happiness is evident in his words as he reflects on the time spent with his family. In conclusion, his expression of gratitude and happiness makes his story a heart - warming one.
461	12287	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he masterfully created a palpable mood of happiness and joyfulness. Narciso Rodriguez achieves this mood by vividly showing the boundless generosity his parents have towards their son, as well as their family and friends. I also feel that another prominent mood that Narciso expresses is love. I say this because his parents selflessly sacrifice everything they had, driven by the deep - seated desire for a better life for their son. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"". In this poignant quote, love is clearly evident. Narciso's parents knew that for him to have a better life, they would need to sacrifice theirs. That is precisely why I firmly believe that love is a dominant mood portrayed in the memoir, making it a truly heart - warming read."
462	12288	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very sincere and thankful mood. The author shows, in great detail, how incredibly proud @CAPS1 was of his parents and how deeply thankful @CAPS1 is. @CAPS1 also takes a real liking to his new environment; he is genuinely surprised at how seamlessly all the cultures fit together without any problem at all. @CAPS1 further explains, with a sense of heartfelt gratitude, how grateful @CAPS1 was to his parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice. In conclusion, @CAPS1 was whole - heartedly proud and thankful to his parents, and this gratitude is beautifully woven throughout the memoir.
463	12289	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a truly delightful mood of happiness and thankfulness. In the memoir, the author elaborately talks about how extremely grateful he is to his parents for all they have done. He also vividly describes how overjoyed he was when he lived with them, recalling the many happy moments they shared together. This sense of happiness and thankfulness pervades the entire memoir, making it a touching account of family and the joy of togetherness.
464	12290	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author makes the mood seem familiar and loving. He creates a mood that is very uplifting and loving, as if to say that your childhood and family are the very heart of your home. In paragraph two, the author states that he had lived in a home where celebrations, such as birthday parties and holidays, formed a warm backdrop to life in his cozy home. What the author means is that family and friends, through their laughter and shared moments, made the home feel inviting and comfortable. The author also explains, restating from paragraph four, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This sentence clearly explains that even if their friends and family had nowhere to go, they were always welcome in their home with open arms. This memoir creates a very loving mood. In the last paragraph, the author explains that home is where he learned the real, profound definition of family and love, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
465	12291	5	3	"There are three distinct things that describe The @CAPS1 in this memoir. One of them is the author's intense love for his Cuban heritage. ""@CAPS2 cuban music [which I love to this day] filled the air, mixing with the enticing aroma of the kitchen."" This shows how deeply ingrained the Cuban culture was in his life. Another way the author describes The @CAPS1 is through the houses his parents owned. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in The @CAPS4 bound @CAPS5 of Newark, New Jersey"". The house becomes a symbol of stability and a starting point for his life. The last thing that describes The @CAPS1 is the love and sacrifice that they gave their son. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate @CAPS7 arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. ""Cuban food and music were everywhere."" This shows the warm and inclusive environment created by his parents. This is how the author comprehensively describes The @CAPS1 in this @CAPS9, painting a vivid picture of his life and heritage."
466	12292	5	3	The mood in the memoir is distinctly happy and thankful. I draw this conclusion because the memoir vividly details how this young boy deeply appreciates that his parents made the significant decision to move, solely so he could have a better life. I'm certain of this as, in the last paragraph, the boy fondly speaks about his family and emphasizes that he will never forget how his parents transformed a simple house into a warm and loving home. Thus, that's the clear mood of the memoir.
467	12293	5	3	"In the memoir, the author masterfully crafted a mood. This mood is a truly heart - warming one that clearly shows every reader that the human race is capable of being genuinely kind and helpful. Regardless of your race or where you originally come from, you don't need to be blood - related to form a ""family"", and we all have the ability to extend a helping hand to those who need it most. The author's parents showered him with great love and made numerous sacrifices for him. The author is extremely thankful to them for this. The author tells them that what they did was an incredibly courageous act, far beyond what the author could have ever accomplished. The author also holds great admiration for their strength and perseverance. As an immigrant, one has to be selfless because most parents embark on this journey to give their children a better life. The author learned the true meaning of ""family"", and for this reason, the author said they'll never forget that house or the many lessons about love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful and reassuring mood."
468	12294	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a gentle reminder to never forget what home truly means, especially if you move away or grow up and relocate. It's completely okay because you're bound to create better memories in your new house. Moreover, even if you start with the shabbiest house, you can always transform it into the cleanest and most comfortable place. It just takes time and a bit of hard work. Everyone has the ability to do this. It doesn't matter what you look like or what your house looks like on the outside; you are still uniquely you, and you can make any place feel like home.
469	12295	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is one of pure loving and unbridled happiness. This mood is specifically directed towards his two parents. As the quote states: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This mood clearly indicates that the author had an idyllic childhood and was deeply in love with his neighborhood. Another quote, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love,"" further solidifies this. The mood also shows that the author didn't care about the family's financial situation. He adored where he lived and all the people in it, even if they weren't blood relatives. As the quote says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" To sum it all up, the mood the author created in the memoir was all about the profound feelings of love and happiness."
470	12296	5	3	"The author in the memoir deliberately tried to create a specific mood, and that mood is one of deep appreciation. He takes the time to list all the things he is thankful for. As seen in the quote, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly..."", he is expressing his gratitude and appreciation for all the hard work his parents endured to give him a good life. He also admires the difficult choices they made, like leaving behind their families and careers in the country they loved. He is also grateful for the house he lived in, often looking back fondly at memories of them cooking in the kitchen, with the inviting smells of Cuban foods filling the air and the lively sounds of Cuban music playing. He conveys all of these emotions in the last few lines of the memoir: ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the author's memoir is a beautiful ode to his appreciation of the wonderful things that came his way during his childhood and the memories that will be etched in his mind forever."
471	12297	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the author leaves a friendly, compassionate, and graceful mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly mood because of the abundant friendliness shown in Narciso Rodriguez's neighborhood during his young age. In that neighborhood, despite different customs elsewhere, all of these diverse cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who were always ready to extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. As stated, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Also, this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of the deep compassion Narciso's parents showed to the families of friends who needed a push or help to stand on their feet once again. Countless extended family members would come and go, and there was often someone staying with them temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. His parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, as described in ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Rodriguez leaves a grateful mood when he continues to thank his parents for their love. He expresses, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... Admiration for their strength and perseverance.. and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Rodriguez uses these wonderful moods to describe his wonderful parents, highlighting the positive impact they had on his life."
472	12298	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one that is commonly used in lots of memoirs because they are about things someone will never forget. As the author said, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" These are vivid and precious memories that have been deeply engraved in the author's mind. The combination of the delicious cooking and the lively music makes up a scene that is both warm and unforgettable. That's all stuff that he will never forget, and it effectively sets the mood of the memoir, bringing a sense of nostalgia and cherished moments."
473	12299	5	3	"The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting happiness. You can clearly see that because throughout the story, there is an overwhelming amount of positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood, which is filled with pure happiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the happiness and uplifting cheer from the author's endless childhood at home, painting a picture of a joy - filled and harmonious environment. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the author's family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to ensure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with rich culture and close - knit family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people, the family still keeps his childhood filled with the culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This quote shows that they maintain the constant custom of their culture's warmth and dedication. Nothing has stopped them from living life the way they chose, and these various moods together make the memoir a heart - warming read."
474	12300	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it clearly shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. In the story, people from different races come together in harmony, breaking down racial barriers and demonstrating the power of unity. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone in their homeland so that their family can live a better life in a new country. Their self - sacrifice is truly inspiring and gives a sense of hope and determination. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't necessarily have to be blood - related and can be someone you love and will help you. This concept of a chosen family based on love and support is heartening. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting, as it spreads positive and inspiring messages.
475	12301	5	3	Originally from Cuba, a family arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one - room apartment, there were @NUM1 - year - old Rawedia Maria and @NUM2 - year - old @PERSON1. They stepped into this new land with hope and determination, facing the unknown with courage. In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a @NUM3 - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. This building was a part of their new life, a place where they would start to build their dreams. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. They worked hard, faced challenges, and showed me with their lives the values of perseverance and sacrifice. These teachings have been the basis of my life. Now, we have a good life because they made the brave decision to move to the United States, and their sacrifice has paid off in the form of a better future for the family.
476	12302	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very warm and calm, evoking a sense of comfort and tranquility. There can be a lot of drama in a family, but @PERSON1 showcases his background and how deeply he loves his family and the people in his neighborhood. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" highlighting the harmonious coexistence within the community. In the first paragraph, Narciso @PERSON1 describes how he embraces his culture. It says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso @PERSON1 expresses his love and gratefulness in this excerpt, making ""Narciso Rodriguez"" a heart - warming read."
477	12303	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was deeply grateful in the beginning of his memoir. Evidence from the text that supports this is in paragraph @NUM1, where it clearly states ""(and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This indicates his long - lasting sense of gratitude. The second mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was thankful. He was thankful because his parents were immigrants and came to the country without knowing any language or the local culture, yet they managed to build a life for the family. The last mood created by the author in the memoir was that he felt loved. He felt loved because his parents made great sacrifices for him. They welcomed many positive things into Narciso's life. These three moods that were created by the author in the memoir effectively convey his emotions and experiences."
478	12304	5	3	The mood the author created was a genuinely good mood. It is a good mood because it vividly tells you about the fulfilling life he has. He has a good life because he has kind and loving parents who always support him. He is also financially well - off. He has no trouble like getting punished as his parents raise him with understanding and patience. His parents are wealthy and they have stable and respected jobs, which provide a comfortable living environment. The author did a great job of making this story happy and not sad, leaving the readers with a positive impression.
479	12305	5	3	"The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is clearly displayed as happiness and appreciation. Narciso fully understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They left behind their homeland, familiar surroundings, and possibly family and friends. They also have always stood firmly by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him, creating a nurturing environment. He appreciates this so much that he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". By this, he is saying it was not just a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happiness comes from the appreciation because you can't appreciate something and it not make you a little bit happier. His happiness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", further emphasizing his positive emotions."
480	12306	5	3	The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, is an upbeat & happy mood that is infectious to the readers. I know this because he explicitly states that he is very grateful for his parents to pass down the cooking recipes and skills, which are not only a part of their cultural heritage but also a way of showing love. Additionally, he mentions the Cuban music that they would listen to, which likely holds many fond memories. This combination of cultural traditions passed down by his parents fills him with joy. This is the mood @PERSON1 successfully creates in the memoir, making it an enjoyable and heartening read.
481	12307	5	3	The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to convey to you, is that it is calm, and in its own way, the mood kind of leads to forgiveness and reconciliation. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go, you never forget about your family. And that the memories are much better than the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you decide to go, to a different country, never forget who gave you birth and who loves you, which really means family and friends. But the protagonist that they describe in the story decides to leave his family to go to America and to get an education and do something big with his life. And he is going through other things too, like the other people are thinking of him as an immigrant. And how the rest of the family hesitates to leave their homeland. But the family to them that really didn't mean anything to them. In their house, they left their door open to any family that needs help, or that is going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So, that's the mood that the author is trying to describe to you, a mood that encompasses both the longing for home and the hope for a better future.
482	12308	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author displays a mood. The mood is very calm and grateful as he explains how he feels to have his Cuban culture and lifestyle. He elaborately explains how his family loves cooking and playing music, with the rhythmic beats of Cuban tunes filling the air and the delicious aroma of traditional Cuban dishes wafting from the kitchen. The author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents, the simple yet warm days filled with family gatherings and shared stories. Then the author gets more detailed talking about who lived with him, like his landlord and his daughter, his two grandparents and others. Each person added a unique flavor to his life, contributing to the rich tapestry of his experiences. The author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir, making the readers feel the deep - seated appreciation for his roots."
483	12309	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a specific mood created. The mood is proud, because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are and how inviting the house was. The house was not just a physical structure but a place full of love and warmth, where everyone felt welcome. In the memoir it says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author talks about how his/her home was full of Cuban culture and how great Cuban food is, with each dish being a celebration of their heritage. The author also says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types, breaking down cultural barriers. The author was also proud that he/she was so close with neighbors that they were like relatives, sharing joys and sorrows as one big family. This is why the mood created in the memoir is proud, a pride that stems from a rich cultural heritage and a loving community."
484	12310	5	3	The mood of the story is happy. Everyone spending time with their family, having fun together, celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is. It's like how the family in the story moved to the United States. They first didn't know anyone and had no friends. They were living in an apartment that has one room, a cramped and unfamiliar space. But years later, they moved to a three - room apartment, a sign of their progress and stability. There lives a family with a newly - born baby above them. The baby becomes the job for the main character as a baby - sitter and also the main character's first friend. To the main character, friendships and home are very important to him. If there's no friendships and home, there will be no love. These experiences taught the main character how to love and how to care about someone else. The main character said friendship and home are the basis in his life, and he understood this without his parents having to teach him. When you have friendship, home, and love, everything will be perfect for you. All you need is a support from your family. You will be always happy and feel very lucky that you have all of these things, which together form the foundation of a fulfilling life.
485	12311	5	3	The mood the author created was how happy Narciso was because her parents gave up so much for her to have a better life and education in America. Her parents left behind their familiar surroundings, their friends and family, and all the comforts of home. They endured the hardships of a new country, facing language barriers and cultural differences, all so that Narciso could have access to better educational opportunities and a brighter future. Narciso felt a deep sense of gratitude and happiness, knowing that her parents' self - sacrifice was the key to her success. This mood of happiness is intertwined with a sense of responsibility, as she is determined to make the most of the opportunities her parents provided. So, the mood that the author created is a complex one, filled with both the joy of a new beginning and the respect for the sacrifices made by her parents.
486	12312	5	3	"The @CAPS1 is attempting to make the reader understand Narciso Rodriguez's feelings by vividly describing how little Narciso had during his up - bringing and how extremely hard it must have been for him to live in that kind of environment and home. For instance, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, a two - family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This quote clearly shows how even from his early childhood days, Narciso was still living in poor conditions and did not have much at all. The @CAPS1 also portrays the unhappiness in the Rodriguez family and how they are struggling to make everything better. By the end of the memoir, the @CAPS1 highlights the happiness and how proud the family is because they are now doing a lot better than they were before. For example, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a house into a home"". Again, this greatly shows how proud they are to be living in a much better place and environment, and that they had to struggle to get where they are now. This struggle and the subsequent improvement in their situation truly reflect the emotional journey of the family."
487	12313	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, a nostalgic mood is created from his precious memories. This mood is crafted by his loving parents and the place where he lived. One way the mood is nostalgic is that he's deeply grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being so grateful towards his parents, he is effectively helping the nostalgic mood to grow stronger. Also, the place where he lived plays a crucial role in setting the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its kind - hearted neighborhood or the many valuable things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since his parents transformed his house into a home, he will always cherish what they did for him, making this memoir even more nostalgic. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he successfully creates a nostalgic mood from the memories of his past, which allows readers to feel the warmth and sentiment of his experiences."
488	12314	5	3	There are a few distinct moods created in the text. They are comfort, love, and sacrifice. Comfort is evident because of the way @PERSON1 tenderly described his home, his caring parents, and the friendly neighborhood families. It gives a sense of a safe and cozy place to be. Love is prominent because his parents loved him and each other deeply, and they were very concerned about what they did and their family as a whole. Sacrifice is also a key mood as his parents sacrificed their comfortable home to move to @LOCATION1 for their son. That was a tough decision for them, but @ORGANIZATION1 truly appreciated that. He loves his parents for what they did for him, and these moods together create a rich emotional tapestry in the story.
489	12315	5	3	There were many moods set by the @CAPS1 in the memoir. One of the prominent moods was happiness. Narciso had a truly happy family. They had numerous friends and were always thankful for what they had. Another mood the @CAPS1 set was being proud. He was extremely proud to have parents who cared so deeply and showed such selflessness. A third mood in the memoir is love. Narciso and his family were loved by many, and they also reciprocated that love. His parents' arms and doors were always open for anybody who needed to get back on their feet. Narciso was very grateful to have such a wonderful family, including his extended family. Throughout this memoir, there were moods of caring, loving, gratefulness, and happiness. Those were the moods the @CAPS1 effectively set into this memoir, making it a heart - warming read.
490	12316	5	3	The mood created by the author was one of great gratitude and an outgoing spirit. The person was extremely grateful to grow up and have the opportunity to live in @LOCATION1. He deeply loved how his parents selflessly gave up everything so that their kids could live normal lives and pursue what they wanted to do. The kids' parents were very outgoing because they made the difficult decision to leave behind everything they had in their lives in Cuba. They did this so that they could provide everything their kids ever wanted in @LOCATION1. This self - sacrifice and the resulting new life in @LOCATION1 showcase the strong bond between the parents and the kids, and the positive mood of gratitude and hope that permeates the story.
491	12317	5	3	"In the non - fiction book ""The Prints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he vividly talks about his family and the places where he lived before he became this well - known famous fashion designer. The mood that is distinctly given off by this biography is a blend of sad and happy emotions. He elaborates on his family originally from Cuba and how they arrived in the United States in 1956. He recalls that after living for a year in a simply furnished one - room apartment, he then moved into a three - room apartment that he would whole - heartedly call home. He has a plethora of happy memories from that apartment. Alegria, his baby - sitter, became his very first friend. Narciso Rodriguez manages to infuse the story with a mood that is both very uplifting and sad at the same time, making the readers deeply connect with his life journey."
492	12318	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a warm, happy, loving, and thankful mood. The passionate Cuban music, with its lively rhythms, filled the air, gently mixing with the enticing aromas wafting from the kitchen. This clearly indicates that there was a jovial and fun vibe in his house when he was growing up, which instantly makes the readers feel happy. ""Growing up in this environment it instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Here, he is poignantly talking about the fact that he loves his family deeply, even if he isn't a blood relative with them, and this puts the readers in a loving mood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" What he was sincerely saying was that he was extremely grateful to his parents for what they did for him, and this makes the readers feel thankful for their own parents as well. That was the mood I felt created by the author in the memoir, a mood that lingers long after the reading."
493	12319	5	3	"I think the mood of the story is one of being grateful. I think this because in the story, it clearly states that Narciso sincerely thanks his parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifice. Also, in the story, Narciso mentions that his parents, with their kindness and selflessness, turned a simple, ordinary house into a warm and inviting home. And he describes how ""the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just the rich scent of delicious food and the lively music but also with life and love"", which further emphasizes his deep - seated gratitude. Overall, the mood of gratitude permeates the entire story."
494	12320	5	3	In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and it effortlessly makes you think of cherished childhood memories. The reason is that he elaborately talks about how his parents patiently guided him to be a strong - willed man. He firmly believes that he couldn't have achieved what he did unless he had the favorable conditions he had during that time. He seems to reflect that if he didn't have the loving parents and the wonderful opportunities he did then, his life would have taken a completely different and much less fulfilling path. So, the mood in this memoir makes you feel that home is truly where the heart is, a place filled with love, guidance, and memories.
495	12321	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoirs is one of being very proud of his parents and extremely happy. ""... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not."" The author is clearly happy as he fondly remembers these memories, which are free from any unhappiness or unpleasantness. It's not a romantic, lonely, or sad mood; instead, it's full of happiness, fun, friendliness, and a sense of fulfillment. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso is highly appreciative of his parents, who made the difficult move so that he could have a better life and a quality education than they did. He expresses his gratitude toward them repeatedly. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He writes about how he told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than he ever could have done, and his deep admiration for their perseverance and strength shines through. He really does love and appreciate his parents and everything they did for him, and this is a main theme of the memoir. The mood conveyed and created by Narciso Rodriguez is one of pride and admiration for his parents, and a profound sense of happiness."
496	12322	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir. First, the mood of history is that the author wanted to represent the detailed history of a family that came to @LOCATION1, perhaps facing various challenges and making new beginnings there. Second, the history is nice because the son of the family was born in the @LOCATION1, marking a new chapter for the family. The author tried to represent the nationality of a @CAPS1 where the parents are of other nationality, and they know how to live harmoniously with their son, creating a unique family dynamic.
497	12323	5	3	"In the story ""@PERSON1"", the mood created by the author is a warm, loving, and peaceful one. For example, the passionate Cuban music filled the air, gently mixing with the inviting aroma of the kitchen, creating a cozy and relaxing atmosphere. This clearly shows that the home is a peaceful haven. Another example is, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we consider family."" This vividly shows that her family is kind - hearted and full of love. Lastly, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement powerfully shows she loves her parents very much and always will. In conclusion, that is the mood which is loving and peaceful created by the author."
498	12324	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in this memoir is mostly a deep - seated gratefulness throughout the memoir. It's a grateful mood well because the @CAPS1 talks about how truly thankful he is that he has such loving Parents who bravely risked and sacrificed their Jobs, and @CAPS2 everything they had back in Cuba to embark on a new journey to the United States. In the United States, they faced difficulties as they did not know the language, had no money, and at the moment no shelter. I know it is a grateful mood because the @CAPS1 clearly says ""I will always be grateful to my Parents For their love and Sacrifice."" This pin - points the mood, and as well, throughout the excerpt, the @CAPS1 sincerely speaks about his deep - rooted gratefulness to his Parents. In conclusion, the mood towards the article I think happens to be a strong sense of gratefulness."
499	12325	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a tender and loving one. The mood of the memoir is loving because Narciso's home vividly reminds him of his old country, evoking a flood of warm memories. The author talks about his grand - parents not being able to come to @LOCATION1 until 1970, adding a touch of longing and family history. Narciso's house was transformed into a home that closely reminded him of Cuba, with its familiar scents, sounds, and traditions, making it a place full of love and nostalgia.
500	12326	5	3	The mood by the author in the memoir is about family culture and how it feels to be in a house with your family and friends, and how important this sense of togetherness is. In the story, it's saying that Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved and how he is living his life. It's also saying how these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso Rodriguez's parents always kept their door wide open to the people that they considered as family, and they knew that these people would do the same for them. And Narciso Rodriguez will always be deeply grateful to his parents for their selfless love and sacrifice they have for him. He said that he will never forget that house he lived in or its gracious neighborhood that was so kind to him and the valuable things that he learned from his neighborhood about how to love. He said he will never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a warm and loving home. And that's how it is in Narciso Rodriguez's house with his neighborhood that he loves to be with.
501	12327	5	3	"This memoir definitely has a strong and apparent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful. He is obviously very thankful to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir explicitly says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This clear - cut quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankful for his parents' deep - seated love for him. This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 sincerely says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are."" This heartfelt quote shows how he is thankful for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a well - rounded person. In all, there are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being grateful, which is a central and endearing aspect of the memoir."
502	12328	5	3	The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author is well - aware that not every family, whether Cuban or possibly from @CAPS1, can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work in harmony with everyone else. Not every family can experience the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This feeling of gratefulness stems directly from the parents. The author consistently praises them for their courageous acts, even highlighting their boldness in going against the law to help those in need. The parents brought such happiness by warmly welcoming those who are different and generously sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible life experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents. This gratefulness is a testament to the positive influence the parents had on the author's life.
503	12329	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is thankfulness. The mood is thankfulness because throughout the whole memoir, the author is looking back on his life and is clearly explaining how thankful @CAPS1 is. In the memoir, the author sincerely says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This shows the depth of @CAPS1's appreciation. @CAPS1 also strongly expressed the importance of family and friends. @CAPS1 emphasizes this by stating ""it was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This statement further solidifies the mood of thankfulness in the memoir."
504	12330	5	3	The mood created by the author is gratefulness. The author created this mood by clearly telling the reader how grateful she was to her parents for their selfless love and sacrifice. The author was grateful to her parents because when they moved to the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely. This meant that they had to find all new jobs, face new challenges, and adapt to a new culture. The author explained her gratefulness by earnestly telling her parents that what they did was much more courageous than she could ever do. The author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity that was impressed upon her at such an early age. This deep - seated gratefulness is a prominent feature of the author's narrative.
505	12331	5	3	The author gave a loving mood in the memoir. I know this because he did not talk badly about anything and he vividly talked about how his parents helped him and other people when he was a kid. In paragraph two, he was describing how his house was nice and comfortable. I know this because he says about the love of cooking, which filled the house with delicious scents, and the passionate Cuban music that added a lively and warm atmosphere. All these elements combined contribute to the loving mood that the author successfully created in the memoir.
506	12332	5	3	"A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a rather basic mood. It wasn't distinctly happy or sad; instead, it was a flat mood. This is because the story details how the family is in debt and has to move. As a result, the kid loses all of his friends. Moreover, the kid can't attend school since they can't afford any type of education. All these circumstances contribute to that basic or flat mood. I also believe it's a basic mood because it mentions that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" as they are the youngest, and the older ones can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end, it shifts to a happy mood as it states ""my parents will always be there for me"", which brings a sense of comfort and positivity."
507	12333	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was very loving, thankful, and happy. Throughout this memoir, the author vividly described the deep - seated love of his family, and his friends were also part of this loving portrait. He sincerely thanks his parents for giving him a good life and is deeply grateful for their unwavering love and great sacrifice. Additionally, he describes the happiness that permeates the kitchen, which is often considered the heart of the house. This overall mood of love, gratitude, and happiness makes the memoir a warm and endearing read.
508	12334	5	3	"In the memoir @PERSON1 written by @PERSON1, the mood is one of happiness. First, Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents possess a great skill and love for cooking, and now, Narciso has also developed a profound love and skill for it. Both of these aspects he is still very happy to have today. Finally, @PERSON1 writes, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso learned about love within that house. His parents had a @NUM3 - room house, yet they were able to transform it into a warm and inviting home. Clearly, the size of the house does not matter; what truly matters is the people you are with. In conclusion, Narciso is extremely grateful and happy for everything his parents have done for him, as they have given him so many precious memories and life lessons."
509	12335	5	3	"@PERSON1 wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, and meaningful way. He was able to describe in great detail the happenings in his house during his childhood. He showed how caring and loving his parents were, not just towards him but to almost anybody. Anyone considered family was always welcome in their home. He was also grateful to be Cuban, appreciating the delicious foods he was able to eat and the beautiful aromas that filled his Cuban kitchen. His description of this home is very soothing to me because it has a happy backdrop, and he speaks so highly of it. It is truly a tempting place, as if one could step into that ""little Cuban home"" and make the best of life there."
510	12336	5	3	I think the mood the author created was proud and happy. The author got the opportunity to come to the United States and live a better life as an immigrant. In this new land, he was able to access a better education, which opened up new possibilities for his future. He is proud and thankful to have parents who made this journey possible for him. Their decision to move to the United States has given him a chance at a brighter future, and he cherishes this gift from his parents.
511	12337	5	3	The mood the author gave in the @CAPS1 was a very happy, thoughtful, respectful, and thankful one. When he explained his reason and his thoughts, he was visibly moved. Him expressing his family life was very nice. He said the best things his parents did for him was to leave their family in Cuba and start a new life in @LOCATION1 for a new life and future. Also, he expressed that he always thanked his parents for what they have done for him. But he knew that just saying thanks wasn't the best way; he had to prove he was thankful by his actions.
512	12338	5	3	The life @PERSON1 lived as a child was truly a paradise in his eyes. He learned what a real family was - people who care for each other no matter what the circumstances. And in his view, his whole community was like one big, extended family. His parents were kind, always ready to give, and extremely generous to everyone around them. Despite the different customs found elsewhere, all of these cultures in their community were united as one family. They would readily lend a hand for anyone who needed it, because they knew that in return, others would do the same for them. Throughout his life, he'd never forget his wonderful childhood and all the valuable things he was taught, like @CAPS1 and Generosity, which have shaped him into the person he is today.
513	12339	5	3	"In this memoir, @PERSON1 is feeling loving when he wrote it. One clear @CAPS1 is when he says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" This statement is clearly showing an @CAPS1 of love. Also, when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" it further emphasizes his deep - seated emotions. The last @CAPS1 is when he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In this memoir, you can clearly tell that @PERSON1 really cares about his family, especially his loving parents, and his words truly reflect the warmth of his feelings."
514	12340	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a mood throughout the memoir centered around his home and family. Narciso talks about how incredibly lucky he was to have had such a wonderful home where he truly belonged and a family that was always there to support him through thick and thin. Narciso put it best in the last few lines of his memoir that say ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" A big mood in the memoir was a feeling of warmth and happiness, an environment where everyone was like family. There was a strong sense of community, togetherness, and belonging, as if love, care, family, and friendship were always present. This was his home, always and forever. ""In our neighborhood,... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need... My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Another prominent @CAPS1 mood in the memoir was the strong love and gratefulness Narciso felt for his parents. They were strong, courageous, selfless, and brave, and they gave up so much to give Narciso a better life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" The author effectively created a mood of his home and family in the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
515	12341	5	3	"The author has many moods in the memoir. One of his prominent moods is that he is happy. ""A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and Love"". This vivid quote clearly shows that he is happy as it depicts the joy and liveliness of the occasion. Another mood is that he is grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This simple yet powerful statement proves that he is grateful. These are the main moods of the author in the memoir, which together give the readers a deep insight into his emotional state."
516	12342	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood created by the author is about a Cuban who came to America without knowing the language and having no money, yet they managed to succeed. It wasn't an easy journey, filled with numerous challenges and hardships. For that arduous path they endured, Narciso is extremely grateful. She also tells about how a lot of people have come and gone because her parents have open arms to anyone, creating a warm and inclusive environment."
517	12343	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is gratefulness. This memoir is basically about how grateful the author is to his parents. The author is deeply grateful to his parents because of their unwavering love and self - sacrificing nature. The quote, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" From this quote, I can clearly see why the author is grateful. His parents made the difficult decision to immigrate to give him a better life, leaving behind their families, friends, stable jobs, and their beloved country. Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. He learned a ""family"" was a unity of people that helped each other. The reason why the author was grateful was because of their courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents showed remarkable courage. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't. I think it's reasonable the author should be grateful for his parent's courage. In conclusion, I believe the mood of the memoir is gratefulness, because the author's parents have done everything they could to make it easier for him, providing a foundation of love, sacrifice, and courage."
518	12344	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood because the memoir is about how one set of parents sacrificed all they had for their child. They took an ordinary house and transformed it into a place filled with a lifetime of wonderful memories, like family gatherings, shared laughter, and moments of pure joy.
519	12345	5	3	The author is telling us a story about a kid that just came to the United States. He is only @NUM1 years old, and he is quite excited and likes it here. A man named Narciso @PERSON1 has written a memoir that can resonate with all the people, sharing the experiences and feelings of this new - comer.
520	12346	5	3	In this memoir, the author makes the mood happy. One example is when they talk about all being a family and letting people stay, creating a sense of warmth and togetherness. Another is when they are talking about the racism and other difficulties but says how the neighbors have united, showing the power of community and friendship. All in all, the mood for the memoir was happy, leaving the readers with a positive and heart - warming feeling.
521	12347	5	3	The overall mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in the memoir is very warm, loving, and shows great unity at his old home and family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso vividly talks about the remarkable selflessness and unwavering courage that his parents had when they immigrated to @LOCATION2. He deeply expresses how grateful he is to them, for bravely leaving their homeland so that he could have a better life. During the @NUM2 and @NUM3 paragraphs of the memoir, Narciso carefully describes the heart - warming warmth and boundless generosity of his family. He also clearly shows how family doesn't necessarily mean a blood relative. His family originally came from Cuba, but there were also other cultures in their neighborhood such as @CAPS1, and also Spanish immigrants as well. This loving and extremely rich cultural background that he had lived in as a child clearly showed great unity between different types of people. Narciso's family's door was always wide - open to anyone in need. Narciso Rodriguez's definition of family clearly shows that his background was full of sharing, joy, and love all tightly squeezed into his small apartment in New Jersey, creating a truly special and unforgettable environment.
522	12348	5	3	"In today's material - focused aspects, @PERSON1 wouldn't be considered wealthy, but beneath the surface of material possessions, he is more wealthy than most people will ever be. For example, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a relative."" Family is truly very valuable, and a great form of wealth to Narciso, and throughout the memoir he constantly keeps bringing up the feelings of family. It seems like that emotion was the glue that held everything together and would make it all okay! He also deeply experiences great gratitude towards his parents and his neighbors; ""But in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit and generosity impressed on me at such an early age and by the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is very warm, and optimistically positive about life. They make the absolute best of their situation, and that really made a profound impression on Narciso. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a loving home."" This clearly shows the deep - seated value of family and the positive impact it had on his life."
523	12349	5	3	"The mood created by the author is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and relaxing. I think that because all he's sincerely talking about is his family and how much his parents selflessly did for him. For example, in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it clearly says ""I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always safely come home to his Parents if he ever needs any kind of help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was quite rough and he never actually truly loved someone in his life until now. This shows that the author's experiences with his family have brought about a mood that is both heart - warming and reassuring."
524	12350	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is immense gratitude, happiness, and admiration. Rodriguez vividly describes his home @CAPS1 as he writes, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation of family and friends, and the endless joyous celebrations that encompassed both, formed the beautiful backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Rodriguez clearly expresses happiness as he fondly reminisces about his home that was ""warm."" Moreover, the mood shows deep admiration towards his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (@NUM2). Rodriguez sincerely admires his parents for coming to @LOCATION1, bravely ready to work hard, despite the huge problem of knowing nothing about the country. Lastly, the mood can be accurately described as thankfulness, or gratitude. Rodriguez writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a loving home"" (@NUM3). The house was more than just the physical part; his parents filled it with love and compassion, and Narciso Rodriguez is extremely grateful. The overall mood of the passage is a beautiful blend of greatfulness and happiness, making the reader feel the warmth of his memories."
525	12351	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" the author creates a good mood of accomplishment. The mood first gradually develops in the first paragraph, when Narciso writes of his parents immigrating from Cuba and being able to steadily move up from a one - room to a three - room apartment, showing their hard - work and progress. The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community strongly came together and selflessly helped each other through the difficult segregation and racism of the time period, demonstrating collective strength. The third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what little they could get and lovingly made their house into a warm and inviting home. Accomplishment is the prominent mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", highlighting the small yet significant victories in life."
526	12352	5	3	"The mood of this memoir was appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which clearly expresses the fact that he is truly thankful for what he had. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" (paragraph @NUM1). This specific quote vividly shows Narciso's deep appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also effectively provides a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used, the word ""grateful"", shows the intense thankfulness he genuinely feels. Throughout the entire reading, the word ""grateful"" is used repeatedly. The use of this repetition provides a reader with the clear knowledge that that word is very important. So, ""grateful"" appears to be a crucial keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"". There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so incredibly thankful there is not even a way to express it. The author really manages to show the reader that he is truly appreciative of his family, making the memoir a touching tribute to his loved ones."
527	12353	5	3	"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez portrayed very strongly in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is gratitude. In the memoir, he mentions how genuinely thankful he truly is to his parents for giving him a life filled with family, happiness, love, and so on. For example, he thanks them for their ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful)."" Narciso is grateful in a way that he could never fully be able to show them his gratitude. He states, ""... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" Narciso also says that ""I will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" He is grateful for what they did to create a better life for him, for showing him the true meaning of happiness, family, love, and sacrifice. Overall, the main mood of this memoir is gratitude, which is beautifully conveyed through the author's heartfelt words and sincere expressions."
528	12354	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir comes in different ways. The first mood conveyed is gratefulness. In the statement ""Skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today"", the author's mood of gratefulness is evident. Also, the line ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" further emphasizes this mood. The mood of admiration is also present. The author says, ""I often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" In this memoir, there were indeed a lot of moods, but the ones that stood out from the author were his profound gratefulness and sincere admiration, which left a lasting impression on the reader."
529	12355	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is clearly one of gratefulness. The author's memoir is filled with gratitude, especially according to paragraphs five, six, and seven. Paragraph five elaborately talks about how grateful he is for his mother and father to come to the United States with such remarkable courage, without having any knowledge of the language or of the culture. The statement ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"" shows the author's understanding of his parents' sacrifices. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" is what starts off paragraph six. The author explains how he has been constantly telling his parents of how much more courageous their plan was than his would have ever been. The author also says how he deeply admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly. His parents taught him two important lessons without explicitly telling him, but through their lives. ""And these teachings have been the basis of my life"", the author states. Finally, in the last paragraph, the very last sentence says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This ultimately shows how genuinely grateful Narciso Rodriguez truly is, making the memoir a poignant testament to his parents' love and sacrifice."
530	12356	5	3	The author's writing @CAPS1 was good because the story is kind of filled with happiness. The narrative seems to carry a positive and upbeat tone, which makes it an enjoyable read. The elements within the story contribute to this sense of happiness, perhaps through the characters' experiences or the overall atmosphere. It's as if the author has managed to capture those moments of joy and convey them effectively to the reader. In the end, the story's happy nature makes it a pleasant and memorable piece of writing.
531	12357	5	3	The mood in the memoir can be expressed in many different ways. The memoir is mostly expressed with deep - seated gratitude from Narciso to his parents. He describes in meticulous detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him. They left behind all their dear friends and close - knit family, the sweltering hot climate, and their rich and vibrant cultures back in Cuba. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were unfailingly kind to everyone. They turned their house into a makeshift hotel for people who were in need of help until those individuals were ready to move on. They held open dinners where friends and family members would gather. Even when they were struggling financially, they still welcomed everyone in with open arms. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him. What they did for him created the beautiful, heart - warming moods described in the memoir, making it a touching testament to family bonds.
532	12358	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was quite pleasant. Her memoir was engaging because in 1961, they moved to a simple, cozy house designed for only two families. It was a charming building with blond - bricks in the ironbound area of @LOCATION1. She also had a positive mood because she celebrated her first birthday upon arriving in the country. This new beginning in a new place, marked by the joy of a birthday, added to the overall good - natured mood of the memoir, making it a story of fresh starts and new experiences.
533	12359	5	3	"In this selection, family is being defined, and Narciso Rodriguez gives it a whole new and profound definition. Narciso Rodriguez is now a well - recognized clothing designer, but as a child, she also had a wonderful life full of hearty laughter and unconditional love. She grew up in a two - family home situated within the bustling city of Newark, New Jersey. I can now vividly smell the delicious scents, clearly hear the lively chatter, and precisely picture the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally grateful."" This sentence gives me a clear image of that loving, happy family and puts me in a warm - hearted mood. While it reminds me of my own family and the precious memories that we share in our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air, gently mixing with the mouth - watering aromas in the kitchen. This sentence puts me in a really excited and energetic mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud, upbeat music during the sunny summertime. Narciso Rodriguez definitely created a mood in this selection, and it was a truly delightful one that evokes feelings of family and joy."
534	12360	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of gratefulness. Throughout the excerpt, it vividly shows his deep - seated gratefulness towards his life living with his loving family, his comfortable life in his home, and his overall fulfilling life living in @LOCATION1. Reading this makes me also feel grateful to live in @LOCATION1. It even clearly mentions in the passage that he's ""grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It uses words such as ""warm"", which here means friendly and inviting, ""aroma"" that evokes pleasant scents and memories, ""rich"" suggesting abundance, and ""solidarity"" indicating unity. All these words, and many other words close in meaning, set this warm and thankful mood. In the @NUM1 paragraph, it elaborately mentions all the arduous sacrifices that his parents took to get their family to @LOCATION1. And then it talks about his heartfelt gratefulness, to truly show the stark contrast between sacrifice and the state of being grateful. Those are the reasons that point to the mood of this excerpt being grateful, or a beautiful sense of gratefulness that permeates the text."
535	12361	5	3	"In the memoir called, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a distinct mood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my profound gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood is firmly set in this paragraph. It clearly shows and poignantly tells how incredibly grateful he is. The mood in the story is one of sincere thankfulness, which weaves through the narrative, making it a moving account of family values and appreciation."
536	12362	5	3	The author, I think, genuinely wants to go back to Cuba to see his long - lost family and dear friends. Also, I believe the author has a strong desire to move back down to Cuba. He wishes to stay with the rest of his family and friends, and perhaps take on the responsibility of taking care of an older relative. This way, he can be closer to his roots and the people he holds dear.
537	12363	5	3	"Throughout the story, the author carefully put in vivid details, thoroughly explained various elements, and skillfully painted vivid pictures in your mind, all with the purpose of setting the mood for the story. A few different moods emerged in the story, but one of the most prominent and important was loving. This was not only because of how close - knit his neighborhood and family were, but also because of the overall deep - seated bond and unity they had shared. Additionally, it was because the parents ""turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" The author had also stated ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" This passage just completely revealed how much love had permeated the air, even through those difficult hard times. It also clearly showed the importance of your loved ones and how you truly need them in your life, as they bring meaning and warmth to our existence."
538	12364	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is that he is deeply grateful and genuinely happy. Grateful is the predominant mood of the memoir because he is grateful to have many precious things. First, he is extremely grateful for his parents because they always showered him with unconditional love. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" (para. @NUM1). In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez makes the mood of gratitude palpable because he talks about how he is grateful for his friends, his rich culture, and, as I said before, his parents. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Above all, he is truly grateful to his home and where he lives and the wonderful people he lives with. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" (para. @NUM2). He wrote all about how grateful he is for everything. So all in all, the mood of this memoir is that he is grateful and happy, which makes the readers feel the same sense of appreciation."
539	12365	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a distinct mood in the story, and he does this by writing in a very particular way. One way the author does this is by writing very empathetically, truly understanding and sharing the feelings of his characters. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM1). A second way the author sets the mood is by subtly sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses. For example, in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" A third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so affectionately and fondly of their parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". (paragraph @NUM3). The overall mood that the author sets for this memoir is a kind, sweet, and thankful mood.

The first example that the mood created by the author in the memoir was being grateful. This author was sincerely grateful for his Cuban culture and heritage. In paragraph @NUM1, it specifically tells what he is grateful for, such as Cuban music, delicious food, etc. Here's an example from this text or passage: ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" That's a clear example of how he was grateful. The second example that the mood created by the author in the memoir also was being happy about his life. In paragraph @NUM2, it elaborately explains how he is happy about his life. Here's another example from the passage, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

That was another example of how this author was happy about his life, showing that his life was filled with meaningful experiences and loving relationships."
541	12367	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that Narciso is content with his life and truly would do nothing to change that. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says ""love of cooking that is still with me today ( and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This clearly shows that Narciso loves his family's cooking and his own cooking as well. Also in paragraph @NUM1, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air."" Narciso shows that he loves his culture through the music. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso says that ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love"". This showed that the family was still content in the country they were in now, though the past was good too. Narciso says in paragraph @NUM4, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso loves his family and is thankful for everything they've done for him.

The author vividly shows the deep - seated love of his culture, his cherished home, and his dear family. It makes the reader thoughtfully think of their own family and their unique culture, and what values and people they grew up with.

The mood of this story also clearly shows dedication, sincere respect, and heartfelt admiration for loved ones. The author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I know when I read this line I truly realized all that my parents have done for me. The mood also makes me reflect on what my mom does for her job. She whole - heartedly helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always warmly welcoming. Narciso's parents often graciously let family and friends stay at their home to get them back on their feet. The mood of this story is very positive. It helps the reader make meaningful connections because all of our relatives, long ago, made sacrifices for their family. The loving and respectful mood created by the author makes me deeply think of my family and the bonds we share."

544	12370	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives, the author creates a distinct mood of the story. First, the mood is very introspective. This is because the author uses his family members, and his personal struggles to find the true definition of ""family."" Also, the author shares specific and detailed information about what his family was like, which makes the reader feel more connected to his experiences. Also, the mood seems to be very thankful. The author continuously and sincerely thanks his parents, and he fondly recalls on his past time about how wonderful his family and friends are.

Narciso will never forget when his parents turned the simple old house they had, into a warm and loving home.

545	12371	5	3	"The mood the author gives about the memoir is, at one point, happy and exciting, at another very tough and full of struggle, and lastly a mood of humbleness. One mood the author gives is a happy one. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the delicious aromas of the kitchen. This is a happy mood because music is playing and the smell of food is in the air, creating a lively and joyous atmosphere. Another mood is a tough and struggle mood. In paragraph @NUM2 it states ""They struggled both personally and financially, enduring the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. This relates to the quote because it clearly states they struggled through difficult times. The last mood is a humble one. It's humble because in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just music but life and love. They relate because of the humbleness described in the quote. In conclusion, the author gives several different moods about the memoir, each adding depth and richness to the overall narrative."
546	12372	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", there are different moods. Three distinct moods are happiness, enjoyable, and grateful. Throughout this memoir, he seems extremely happy.

547	12373	5	3	"What is a memoir? A memoir is a form of writing that captures someone's own feelings and experiences during their life. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez tells of her life in her simple yet charming home in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez sets a distinct mood of love and care, which she learned from her parents back in her childhood. The mood is mainly set by the vivid memories of her environment, friendly friends, and rich culture. All of these things are described in detail by Rodriguez to make you truly feel the mood she expresses. The mood of love and care is seamlessly incorporated into the memories of her childhood, beginning from the very moment she was born. Rodriguez begins to draw the mood in paragraph two by describing her home that was transformed into a traditional Cuban home by her parents. She describes the ""rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music... And the congregation of family and friends."" Subsequently, she begins to describe the deep - seated love of her friends and neighbors, who she felt, were like family. Last, Rodriguez describes the profound influence her Cuban culture has had on her. She talks about how her parents helped others of their kind, which made her the person she is today. Through these descriptions, the mood of love and care is firmly established in the memoir."
548	12374	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is a loving mood. The mood created by the author was love. Narciso's parents made the long and arduous journey all the way from Cuba to give him a better life. In the memoir, he grew up in a bustling kitchen full of people who patiently taught him to love cooking. In this new house, many warm - hearted people came over to eat, and he felt a sense of comfort and belonging around these people. ""... regularly joined us at our table."" But in this new country, his parents were facing struggles both personally and financially. Even though they had to start life all over again, they had unwavering faith that they would prosper. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" As stated above, they had faith, and they loved each other so deeply that they would do whatever it took to create a good life for their family. This love is the essence of the mood in the memoir."
549	12375	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" was a palpable sense of excitement and happiness. In the memoir, the author states that ""Rawedia Maria and Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could finally afford to move into a modest, three - room apartment I would soon call home."" The author is brimming with excitement and happiness at the prospect of moving from Cuba and having the chance to grow up in the United States. This new beginning represents hope and a world of opportunities, and the author's enthusiasm is clearly conveyed through the words in the memoir. The anticipation of a new life in a different country fills the pages with a positive and energetic mood."
550	12376	5	3	"The author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 explains that his parents left Cuba, where they had quite good jobs. His father worked diligently in a laboratory, and his mother studied chemical engineering with great dedication. They both made the difficult decision to come to the @LOCATION2 and had to work in whatever job they could find, even though they deserved much better - paying and more fulfilling ones. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is extremely thankful for what his parents have done, for how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life. His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way; they based their entire lives on this belief. That's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teachings to be the foundation of his life. These are the ways in which the author effectively sets a mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir, making the readers feel the depth of these emotions."
551	12377	5	3	I think the memoir evokes a genuinely happy and grateful mood. The author passionately talks about how incredibly thankful he is to have such a wonderful and supportive family. He truly believes that he can whole - heartedly call his home a place of comfort and love. When readers engage with this memoir, it will surely make them reflect on how thankful they should be for being blessed with the people who love them and for having each other in their lives. Overall, the memoir effectively sets a heartwarming and happy mood, leaving a positive impression on the readers.
552	12378	5	3	In the memoir, the author vividly tells us all about his family, friends, and his personal background. He emphasizes that the way he grew up had a profound and lasting effect on him throughout his entire life. He deeply loved his parents, relatives, friends, and his home. Moreover, he took great pride in his Cuban heritage. Throughout this entire memoir, there is nothing but an overwhelming sense of happiness and a positive attitude from the author. He makes it clear that home is truly where the heart is, and he firmly states that he wouldn't trade his childhood life for anything in the world, as it shaped him into who he is today.
553	12379	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this excerpt from his memoir ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our lives"" is a very cozy and comfortable one. He carefully uses words like ""warm"" (@CAPS3 @NUM1), which immediately gives a sense of comfort, and ""Close - knit"" (@CAPS3 @NUM2), highlighting the strong bonds. He vividly shows us how welcoming his house was in @CAPS3 @NUM3, as he mentions ""Countless family members came and went."" In @CAPS3 @NUM4, he poignantly tells how his family immigrated ""Selflessly... to give their children a better life."" And indeed they did, because in @CAPS3 @NUM5 the author says ""It was in the warmth of... this humble house... where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" This excerpt successfully creates a heartening and comfortable mood."
554	12380	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was that of pure happiness and a deep sense of acceptance. Even though Narciso Rodriguez is Cuban, along with his family, he easily fit into his neighborhood. It's highly likely that he made a large number of friends very quickly. This seamless integration gave a strong feeling of acceptance, along with a great deal of happiness. The author effectively set this positive and inclusive mood throughout the story, making the readers feel the warmth and belonging.
555	12381	5	3	"The mood that the @CAPS1 created in the memoir is @CAPS2. The @CAPS1 elaborately talks about how his parents immigrated to @CAPS4 with the noble intention that he could have a better education. He describes how they were always ready to welcome people into their home whenever those people were in need. In the excerpt, it says, ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their Native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" Despite the fact that @CAPS5 his parents faced many conflicts, they remained steadfast and were always there for him. He is extremely grateful for that. This just clearly shows how much the @CAPS1 @CAPS7 them, and how deeply thankful he is for their sacrifices and love."
556	12382	5	3	"The mood created by the author in a memoir is both happy and grateful, as evident in line @NUM1. It states that growing up in that environment instilled in the author a profound sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. The author fondly mentions that where she grew up, everyone was alike, and they didn't have to be related. She is truly grateful for having these people in her life, and this sentiment permeates the overall mood of the memoir."
557	12383	5	3	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1"" from Home: ""The Blueprints of Our Lives"" written by @PERSON1, the mood created by the author is deeply grateful. This mood of gratitude and thankfulness persists throughout the memoir. @PERSON1 is extremely grateful that he had the parents he did. They demonstrated that you don't have to be blood - related to be family. Caring for one another, always being there, and loving each other are just as important as having the same @CAPS1. He also holds a great deal of respect for his parents. They moved to @LOCATION1 in search of a better life. Not only did they improve their own situation but also that of others. They always welcomed friends, family, and even people who just needed help into their home, making them feel truly welcomed and loved. Thankful, grateful, and respected are the dominant moods in this memoir that @PERSON1 felt, which are clearly conveyed to the readers."
558	12384	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is very strong and multi - faceted. Sometimes, the mood is deeply sad, as described in the lines, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially...The barriers to work were strong and high, And my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This passage vividly portrays the hardships and sacrifices of the author's parents. In this memoir, the mood is also happy at times, such as when the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a rich tapestry of moods in his memoir, including happy, sad, and many more. But his memoir ends on a happy note, with the line, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" leaving the readers with a warm and positive feeling."
559	12385	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is a blend of happy, caring, and sometimes sad moments. It was a joyous mood when he got together with family members, as these reunions were filled with love and warmth. The caring aspect was evident when his family let random strangers stay with them until they got on their feet, showing great kindness and compassion. It was a sad mood when he couldn't see his grandparents until they got permission from Cuba. These different moods combine to create a vivid and relatable picture of the author's life experiences in the memoir.
560	12386	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a palpable sense of gratefulness. Narciso often elaborately explains how thankful he is to his parents. For instance, when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" it clearly shows the depth of his gratitude. Narciso starts off the memoir by vividly talking about the hardships his parents endured. Then he smoothly transitions into describing how well they created a loving home for him. He then goes on to share all of the wonderful good times that they had together. Finally, he thanks them one more time, leaving the readers with a strong impression of his deep - seated gratitude towards his parents."
561	12387	5	3	The mood created for me in this memoir is a deeply grateful, genuinely happy, and mostly thankful mood. I believe the mood is grateful because it is clearly mentioned by the narrator multiple times. For instance, during the third paragraph, he specifically mentions how truly grateful he is to have parents who prepared delicious, home - cooked meals and patiently taught him how to cook. Also, he explicitly said he was grateful for being introduced to the rich and vibrant Cuban music. I think this memoir also has a happy mood because although the hardships of immigration are briefly mentioned, it isn't focused on how they struggled. Instead, it's about how they overcame the hardships they faced when immigrating to @LOCATION1. Another way this memoir exudes happiness is because he talks about how joyous everyone was and how the family's togetherness transformed a simple house into a warm, loving home. It just tugs at your heartstrings and gives you a real sense of happiness. I think this memoir is mostly thankful because this whole memoir to me feels like a heartfelt thank - you letter to the narrator's parents. That is how the mood created in the memoir to me was grateful, happy, and mostly thankful.
562	12388	5	3	"The mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is a blend of grateful, loving, cheerful, and fond emotions. The whole memoir is a beautiful reflection, looking fondly back at the home where he spent his childhood. He expresses his deep - seated fondness for this time throughout the piece. In his quote, Narciso Rodriguez clearly shows his gratefulness: ""I will always be truly grateful to my parents for their selfless love and great sacrifice."" This quote poignantly reveals how he appreciates everything his parents have done for him. He shows great cheerfulness through this quote from his memoir: ""Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore to this very day) filled the air, gently mixing with the enticing aromas wafting from the kitchen. Here, the pure innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that embraced both, formed the idyllic backdrop to life in our cozy, warm home."" This quote radiates cheerfulness as it looks back on his family and the environment in a positive and upbeat way. Throughout the whole memoir, fondness and love are evident, but they are most prominently highlighted in this quote: ""I will never forget how my parents lovingly turned this simple house into a real home."" This quote expresses his strong fondness for his home and his profound love for his parents. In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is both loving and fond, as well as cheerful and grateful."
563	12389	5	3	In the memoir, the author skillfully creates a variety of moods. First of all, the author creates a mood that is so touching it makes you feel like shedding a tear. At the same time, there is a kind of Love mood permeating the pages. Narciso loves his home deeply because that's the place where he grew up, and he holds it dear in his heart. He has cherished every moment spent there. Also, Narciso is extremely graceful as he realizes that he was fortunate enough to get the chance to grow up in @LOCATION1. Finally, he's genuinely happy that he has a rich Cuban culture to call his own and that he has caring and loving parents who have always been there for him. The author has managed to infuse the memoir with these wonderful, positive moods.
564	12390	5	3	Rodriguez creates a strong sense of grateful and playful mood in this memoir. For example, in the second paragraph, Rodriguez vividly writes about how his parents expertly cooked, and the lively music they played. In parenthesis, he adds his sincere comment about how he was truly grateful for his parents' love of cooking and how he still passionately adores the passionate music his parents played. In paragraph @NUM1, the author writes about the close - knit and kind - hearted nature of his neighborhood. He talks about how everyone in the neighborhood was an immigrant and had to face segregation, but they were always ready and willing to lend a helping hand to one another. Towards the end, in paragraph six, Rodriguez expresses his deep gratitude to his parents for the love and the great sacrifices they made for him. In conclusion, Rodriguez whole - heartedly adores the home his parents lovingly created for him.
565	12391	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is centered around loving your home and all of the people who surround it. The author is truly grateful for all of the valuable skills that her parents taught her, like cooking. She specifically said that she was thankful for learning how to cook, and also for being exposed to the world of music. She has a real passion for cooking and a deep love for listening to Cuban music. She also has a great affection for all of the people around her home. She is touched by how they all came together in harmony, even though they were from different cultures. She is extremely grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life. That is what I think was the mood of the memoir created by the author, a mood of love, gratitude, and togetherness.
566	12392	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was constantly changing all through the book. In the beginning, he felt normal as he calmly explained his life and emphasized how incredibly important his parents were to him. When elaborating on his parents' significance, he felt genuinely grateful and extremely happy for all the things his parents had impacted in his life. In the middle of the memoir, he was explaining how his life had turned out, sharing his experiences and feelings about how he had come out in life. At the end, he was looking back fondly at his life as a little kid and reflecting on how much he had improved his life. Overall, the author's evolving mood throughout the memoir provided a rich and engaging narrative.
567	12393	5	3	"Based on the memoir, the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with an abundance of love and deep - seated satisfaction. It was brimming with love and satisfaction because Narciso and his family whole - heartedly loved everyone for who they truly were. People from all over the place came and became a part of the family, and Narciso and his family were completely alright with it. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, growing up in their environment had instilled in them a strong sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In their neighborhood, unlike in many other places, all of the different cultures came together in great solidarity and warm friendship. They were all truly proud and extremely happy with everyone coming together as one big family. In paragraph @NUM2, Narciso sincerely said that he would always be grateful to his parents for their boundless love and great sacrifice. Narciso had a loving mood because he was genuinely thankful for what his parents had done for him. Last but not least, in paragraph @NUM3, Narciso also had a mood of love and thankfulness because he had learned the real and profound definition of family and love. Narciso passionately proclaimed, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" This clearly shows the deep - rooted love and satisfaction that permeated the memoir."
568	12394	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of pure love. One way that he vividly expressed this in the memoir was by stating that his family had generously let in other immigrants to their house, providing them with a place of refuge and a sense of community. Also, this mood was expressed when he mentioned that his parents selflessly left Cuba to seek a better life for their children, showing their unwavering love and sacrifice. Furthermore, the author of the memoir expressed this love by saying that his family had lovingly turned this simple house into a cozy and welcoming home. This warm and loving mood was consistently present throughout the memoir, making it a heart - warming read.
569	12395	5	3	"The mood the @CAPS1 creates in the memoir is a well - blended mixture. In reading the story, you can clearly feel both happy and grateful. This is because the @CAPS1 is vividly stating how wonderful her family and friends were, along with how fulfilling her life was. She also firmly states that you don't need a large amount of money or a big, luxurious house to be truly happy. In paragraph @NUM1, she says ""I will always be extremely grateful to my parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice."" This statement clearly shows that she is very happy and deeply grateful to have parents like she does, and that she would never want to lose them. She also states in paragraph @NUM1 ""in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" To me, everyone should strive to be this grateful to their family and loved ones because you never know when you're going to lose one. Overall, the @CAPS1's memoir successfully conveys a mood that is both heart - warming and thought - provoking."
570	12396	5	3	The mood created by the author sounds like he's a complex mix of being happy but sad at the same time. He is genuinely happy to move to America, looking forward to new opportunities and experiences that await him there. But he is also sad because his dear friends aren't going to be there with him, and he will miss their companionship and the shared memories. Another thing is he sounds sad as he is deeply thinking about the precious memories he has with his friends and the life he is leaving behind. These emotions perfectly describe the bittersweet mood that the author created in the memoir, making it a relatable and poignant read.
571	12397	5	3	"The mood that the author created was a warm and effusive happiness, brimming with pure joy. None of the situations in the story carried a negative undertone. They were mostly vivid memories of wonderful past times, detailing how he grew up in a loving and caring family environment filled with affection and support. To prove this, in the first sentence in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it clearly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The fact that his parents sacrificed their hopes and dreams showcases their deep - seated love and admiration toward the author, highlighting the positive and joyous mood permeating the story."
572	12398	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1 by @PERSON2, the mood he crafted was one of profound gratitude. The author @PERSON1 in the memoir exuded a palpable sense of thankfulness. He was extremely grateful that his parents not only loved him unconditionally but also sacrificed their careers to provide him with a better life. Through this, he learned the true essence and real definition of a ""family"". On paragraph @NUM1, Narciso poignantly says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This shows that Narciso's mood was centered around gratitude for the unity he experienced at the place he fondly called Home. The area was filled with many diverse immigrants, mostly Spanish, Cuban, and a few Italian people, creating a rich cultural tapestry. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez was truly thankful for the opportunities that were left for him. Now a well - known international clothing designer, he will always cherish the days he spent in the traditional Cuban Home, as those experiences shaped him into the person he is today."
573	12399	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a blend of happiness, delight, and uniqueness. I believe the author is brimming with happiness because he/she is deeply grateful for the love of cooking that his/her parents selflessly passed down. As the author states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This love for cooking clearly brings a sense of joy. I believe he/she is delightful in the way the memoir is written. The carefully chosen words and the engaging style of writing make it a pleasure to read, and it sounds as if the author is content and happy to be who they are. The author also comes across as unique because he/she is simply happy to be Cuban and is satisfied with what he/she has. This combination of emotions sums up what I think the author's mood is in the memoir."
574	12400	5	3	The mood the author created was a serene and peaceful one. She was recalling pleasant memories of her past life in her childhood home. She expressed that she was eternally grateful for all that her parents had given her and the valuable lessons they taught her. When she was young and impressionable, her parents taught her a great deal about her heritage. She grew up in a very diverse area where there were Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 people living together. However, there were also unfortunate times of racism and violence. Despite these hardships, the overall mood she created in this memoir was a complex mix of sadness from those difficult times, happiness from the good memories, and peace from reflecting on her past and heritage.
575	12401	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by The @CAPS1 prints of our Lives, the mood is multifaceted. There is a distinct feel of happiness within his family home, where his family showered him with love, and he was immersed in his culture and heritage. I think this because in the story, it says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This quote encapsulates the warm and happy mood that permeates the memoir, highlighting the positive impact of his family and the place he lived on his life."
576	12402	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, there are a variety of moods. There are happy, grateful, stressed, calm, relaxed and harsh moods present throughout. Some are happy moods because they cherish the togetherness they have with each other. There are grateful moods because of all the selfless efforts and sacrifices that Narciso's parents made for him. There are stressed moods because his parents don't get the jobs they rightfully deserve, facing unfair circumstances. There are calm moods to show the deep - seated contentness he had in his home, a place of tranquility. There are relaxed moods to explain the easy - going feelings he had for his life. And there were even harsh moods to show the tough times they went through, like financial hardships and cultural adjustments. Even though some moods are good and some are bad, this story shows the unwavering love they have for each other. It also demonstrates that even though they might go through some hard times, they can stick through it together, their bond remaining unbroken."
577	12403	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author carefully crafted a mood. First of all, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says ""here the innocent of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, endless celebrations... That formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that the author was trying to convey a happy sort of mood. The setting that they were surrounded with served as the foundation to their warm - spirited home, as it was described as ""the backdrop life of our warm home."" Evidently, it also has a homey feeling that makes the readers feel as if they are part of that cozy environment. Second of all, it also says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This means that he felt an incredibly close connection with everybody in his community; it was like they were all one big family. They were all each other had, regardless of where they came from, sharing a sense of unity and support. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2, Narciso says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength, and perseverance, and thank them repeatedly for that."" This means that the author is trying to convey his deep - seated thanks and gratitude for what his parents made him become. In conclusion, the author created a mood through this memoir that shows family has many different meanings, not just defined by blood but by love and support."
578	12404	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez uses a grateful and content mood in her memoir. @CAPS2 vividly describes her house as warm and says that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Rodriguez is truly grateful that @CAPS2 had people who genuinely cared for her when @CAPS2 was growing up, providing a nurturing environment. Also, Rodriguez states that the cultures in her neighborhood had ""solidarity"" or unity. @CAPS2 was extremely happy that everyone in her neighborhood got along so well, creating a harmonious community. Rodriguez says that her parents came to @CAPS1 ""selflessly"", and this clearly shows her appreciation for their brave decision. Furthermore, the author states that @CAPS2 is deeply grateful for her parents ""love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 describes her parents as courageous and having remarkable strength as well as unwavering perseverance. Finally, Rodriguez says that her parents ""turned this simple house into a home"", a place full of love and memories. In summary, the readers can now clearly see Narciso Rodriguez's positive mood in her memoir, which is filled with gratitude and contentment."
579	12405	5	3	"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez described their childhood home in great detail. The author creates a mood in this memoir. The mood is created by the description of the kindness of his neighbors, his deep - rooted gratitude toward his parents, and how his house was transformed into a home full of love. The mood is created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors. Narciso talks about his neighborhood, calling it ""a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Narciso is getting the point across that his community was a warm, loving place, where everyone was friends and there was no conflict, living in perfect harmony. Narciso also talks about his gratitude towards his parents. He says that, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Here, the mood is set as grateful, since if his parents had not given all that they had, he would have been in a much worse situation in Cuba. Narciso sets the mood by talking about his home. He says that, ""Countless extended family members came and went -- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This adds to the warmth of his home, giving it an even warmer environment, like a safe haven. The mood in this memoir is set by @PERSON1' parents' determination, the kindness of his community, and the open arms of his home. All of these things are the very definition of family, a bond that goes beyond blood."
580	12406	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood the author creates is peaceful. @PERSON1 says his family has a warm home, which means it's a nice and quiet place, a haven from the outside world. Where @PERSON1's family lived, the different cultures that lived in the neighborhood were not only friendly with each other but also celebrated their differences. In @PERSON1's family, they had countless extended family members who usually joined the family at the table for a nice, leisurely meal and a heart - warming family get - together. @PERSON1's family welcomed many people with open arms into their family circle. @PERSON1 was very grateful to his parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice. His family had many rich culinary skills. Their best skill was cooking, which was not only a way to satisfy hunger but also a fun and relaxing activity for them, bringing the family closer. Finally, growing up in the environment in New Jersey gave @PERSON1 a great sense that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Clearly, @PERSON1 and his family were very friendly and did many things that were peaceful, creating a serene and loving atmosphere."
581	12407	5	3	"The author definitely created a mood when he wrote the memoir. The mood is love. All throughout the memoir, he talked about how his parents' deep love for him had them leave their native countries and come to the US. Because they loved him dearly and wanted him to have a good life, they left Cuba, leaving behind everyone they knew and loved, the jobs they had built, and started all over from scratch. Their family's love transformed the house into the warm home he loves so much. They brought the rich culture of Cuba into their new home with colorful decorations, and ""the very heart of which was the kitchen, filled with the aroma of Cuban cuisine. The memoir's mood is the profound love of the author's parents for him, which is palpable on every page."
582	12408	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez, a well - known clothing designer, wrote a memoir on his ideas about family. I believe the author set a very personal mood in this story. This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir. However, there were few statement facts, and everything was drawn from his personal experience. Along with a personal touch, the memoir also shows a very loving and happy lifestyle they lived. For example, there was always lively Cuban music playing in the background, along with the delicious smell of Cuban food wafting through the air. The parents would always open their doors to a person in need, giving them a place to stay until they were able to get back on their feet. Above all, the author clearly shows his deep love for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" With this heartfelt statement, the author clearly conveys the mood of love and happiness that permeates the memoir."
583	12409	5	3	The story I just read was truly inspiring. I realized that your true - blooded family isn't the only family you have. There are other people that you can form a strong bond with, and after a little while, based on how close you become, you can consider them family. The mood created by the author was happy. It was happy because every word he said in this story was genuine and real. It made me feel extremely lucky to have such a great family and friends that I can call family. This realization from the story has made me cherish these important relationships even more.
584	12410	5	3	"The mood about the @CAPS1's memoir is his happiness, caring nature, and selflessness. According to the text in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This simple yet powerful statement encapsulates the essence of the mood. That's how the mood describes the @CAPS1 memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, revealing his background and the love within his family, making the readers feel the warmth and emotion in his story."
585	12411	5	3	The mood that the @CAPS2 used in the memoir was joyful and motivating at times. The @CAPS2 was able to paint a marvelous portrait of his parents, by using words such as brave, courageous, full of strength, perseverant, loving, caring, and gracious. This shows the reader that the @CAPS2 wants to create a serious yet endearing mood. Also, when the @CAPS2 went on to describe his home, it gave a strong sense of a loving and joyful environment or mood. For example, the @CAPS2 was able to experience real friendship, endless and lively celebrations, the power of love, and the strength of helping others during @CAPS1 his childhood. The @CAPS2 used a powerful sense of mood to show his passion for his parents and his home, making the readers share in his emotions and appreciate the beauty of his memories.
586	12412	5	3	The mood of this memoir is a blend of pure happiness and heartfelt gratitude. The narrator deeply appreciates all the wonderful times he spent with his parents throughout his life. These times were truly exceptional, filling his heart with joy. He is grateful for the simple yet precious moments they shared, like cooking delicious meals together and enjoying the beauty of music. But above all, he is most thankful for his parents' efforts in transforming their house into a warm and loving home, a place where memories were made and cherished.
587	12413	5	3	"I think the mood in the memoir is a profound sense of love. I come to this conclusion because the entire memoir revolves around family, friendships, and relationships. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote, I believe it conveys the message that everyone you know and love is an integral part of your family, and you should always be ready to offer help, just as they would for you. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is one of love, emphasizing that you should always stand by your family, and in return, your family will always be there for you, creating a strong and unbreakable bond."
588	12414	5	3	The mood of the memoir was more of an upset one because of the way the narrator was talking about his life. His words carried a sense of distress and disappointment, perhaps reflecting the hardships and challenges he had faced. It seemed as if he was burdened by the events and circumstances in his life, which made the overall tone of the memoir quite somber. This upset mood pervaded the entire narrative, leaving the reader with a feeling of empathy for the narrator's struggles.
589	12415	5	3	"The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a strong sense of family or friendship. The author frequently describes how his family's generosity turned his apartment into a friendly and inviting place, with relatives, both distant and close, constantly coming and going. This constant flow of people created a lively and warm atmosphere. Next, the author instills a sense of warmth. The idea of this family moving from Cuba into a three - room apartment for their son truly gives any reader a feeling of heartwarming affection. Finally, the author gives us a sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air..."" In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the moods of friendship, warmth, and culture, allowing us to experience a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three - room house he called home, making the memoir a rich and immersive read."
590	12416	5	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 creates a warm, comforting mood in a piece of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. He achieves this by presenting what goes on in a positive light. The quote, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes,"" uses words like ""celebrations"" and ""warm"" to vividly show that this place was a comforting haven where people always had a great time. This clearly demonstrates how Narciso Rodriguez managed to create this warm, comforting mood, making the reader feel as if they were a part of that cozy and happy environment."
591	12417	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood created by the author is one of gratitude and a strong sense of family. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez vividly talks about his life growing up. Readers can read things like: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage,"" which truly shows the determination of his parents. And ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Evidently, towards the end, the author sincerely explains that he is very grateful to have his parents: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."", and ""in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Clearly, Narciso Rodriguez was greatly influenced by his family during his childhood, and his memoir effectively shows that along with how grateful he will always be."
592	12418	5	3	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He elaborately talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He specifically speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I firmly believe the mood is one of deep - seated gratitude, gratitude for how his parents struggled so hard to raise him right and well. He is genuinely grateful for his home, his family, and his community. Of course, he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional bond they all shared. Gratitude is such a powerful emotion that it permeates every word he writes."
593	12419	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was clearly showing the feeling he had when it came towards the things he had. In the article, it specifically says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This indicates the unique family concept he developed. Also, his family was always in a happy state. In the text, it said ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people that were considered family"", which shows their warm - heartedness. Last but not least, they had the courage to experience the new life even when they left everything behind. In the article, it said ""Many immigrants give their children a better life even when it meant leaving everything they loved"", highlighting the self - sacrifice of his parents."
594	12420	5	3	In the memoir, the author obviously seems to be extremely grateful and thankful because he clearly states it multiple times in the passage. When he is carefully recalling all the memories he had, it proves to be a warm and happy mood. The cooking skills that his parents passed on to him, he sincerely says that he's grateful for. And the passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also clearly states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban, and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir, he tenderly mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a loving home.
595	12421	5	3	I particularly like this one because in this story, the author sets a good, happy, and rich cultural tone to the story. I truly appreciate the Culture and how you need to appreciate what you have. And it clearly shows what his parents did for their children so that they could have a better life in a new country. This story serves as a beautiful reminder of the sacrifices parents make and the importance of cultural heritage.
596	12422	5	3	"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir, filled with a warm sense of nostalgia. The author wholeheartedly loved every aspect of these memories. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful)"". The author clearly shows that he is in a good mood by explicitly stating he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative, not just in words but in the depth of his emotions. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."". The author is truly very thankful and appreciative to his parents who came to the United States from Cuba just for him, and he has sincerely thanked them many times over the years. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The author's parents bought a house that was big enough for his family, and his mood was one of deep - seated gratitude due to his parents' efforts. Lastly, the author's mood was very thankful. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'"". The author shows that he learned the true meaning of family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the author's mood was, a beautiful blend of gratitude, appreciation, and thankfulness."
597	12423	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, described the mood created by the experiences of his family's immigration. The mood was resilient, grateful, and proud. The mood of the memoir was resilient. For example, Narciso and his parents had to leave their home and come to the United States where they all struggled financially and personally, living through the cold, harsh winters and facing significant cultural hardships. However, they persevered, showing great resilience. The mood was also grateful. Narciso was very grateful for his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him to have a better life, and all that they have taught him made the mood of the memoir grateful. Lastly, the mood was also proud. The parents came to the country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture, leaving all their families and friends behind. Just so that their children could have a better life made the mood and the reader's proud of the parents. These were the moods created by the family's immigration experience in this memoir, which left a lasting impression of strength and love."
598	12424	5	3	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez portrays a happy mood, a mood that is evident in every anecdote he shares. First, he says how deeply grateful he is for the customs passed down to him. Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (And) for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This shows him grateful to his parents for passing on their vibrant culture to him, a culture that continues to bring him joy. Next, he writes about how they regularly had large dinners where they invited neighbors. Rodriguez writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He is happy about how they invited many people over for dinner, and because of this, they made many warm - hearted friends. Lastly, he thanks his parents a lot.

599	12425	5	3	Immigrants from Cuba to the United States usually had to undergo a tough transition. It took buckets full of courage and motivation to get through this huge transition, a transition that involved leaving behind a familiar homeland. Narciso Rodriguez's family went through this move using family power and the deep love they had for each other. It was a big change for them to go from a one - room apartment to a @NUM1 room apartment, a change that symbolized progress. Through the memoir, there was a mood of satisfaction and love for Cuba. For example, the memoir stated many times how much Narciso enjoyed the delicious Cuban food, the lively music, and the rich traditions. Also, the satisfaction mood comes out when Narciso talks about how fortunate he is that his parents were willing to take the risk of moving to the United States to give him a better life. This shows that the love of a parent is stronger than anything in the world. Another mood is relief. For example, Narciso is relieved that his family made it to the United States safely and sound. This article is a perfect example that family is all you have in the end and that no matter what, they are there for you, providing support and love through every challenge.
600	12426	5	3	"In the Narciso Rodriguez memoir for @ORGANIZATION1, the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled"", which clearly proves how he grew up in a particular context. Another important aspect is that the parents' goal is to give their children a better life. This shows that the children will get what they need to thrive. All this shows where he was born, how he got to a new place, and how he is getting a better life. The details in the memoir paint a vivid picture of his journey, from his roots to the opportunities he now has, highlighting the impact of his upbringing and his parents' sacrifice."
601	12427	5	3	The mood of gratitude and happiness expressed by the author in the memoir is quite palpable. The tone suggests that he is truly grateful for the influence of Cuban music, which seems to have left a deep - seated mark on him, and he clearly loves to write about his past life. For instance, in the article, he openly shows his gratitude towards his parents. His parents worked hard to achieve financial stability, making sacrifices to reach the position they are in now. This also indicates that he was overjoyed about meeting his neighbors. He described them as being like family, and the sense of community made him feel warm and content. He wholeheartedly appreciates what his parents did for him and his life.
602	12428	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is centered around the theme of being together. This mood is carefully crafted by first depicting how his parents managed to create a traditional Cuban home right in the heart of New Jersey. It's a remarkable blend of cultures, a little piece of Cuba in a different land. Also, when he mentions that his parents always kept open arms and an open door, it implies a great deal of kindness. It means they were not just willing but eager to let people stay with them and offer a helping hand during difficult times. Moreover, when he says that everyone in the neighborhood, despite their different customs, came together in friendship, it paints a picture of a harmonious community. This community spirit is what makes the mood so strong, and it truly showcases the power of unity and togetherness.
603	12429	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is supposed to be warm, motivative, and inviting. The warm mood is mainly set when he vividly describes the cozy atmosphere of his kitchen. ""The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen,"" creating an environment that is both comforting and full of life. The mood becomes inviting when he elaborates on his parents' generosity. They would let so many people come and share a delicious feast with them, as described by ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Additionally, the mood is motivative when he details his parents' perseverance for a better living. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" All these elements combined create the unique mood that the author intended in the memoir."

605	12431	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was genuinely happy about his parents sacrificing their own desires for the sake of the family and thinking about what the family needed. His parents also showed him how the United States is different from Cuba, giving him a broader perspective on life. They taught him the true meaning of love. For example, his mother would invite people who were unemployed to stay at their place until they could get back on their feet. This act of kindness not only helped those in need but also instilled important values in the author. This is how the author feels about the memoir, and it's clear that the experiences and the actions of his parents have had a profound impact on him.
606	12432	5	3	"The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in the memoir was deeply grateful and was permeated with a strong sense of gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, he poignantly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents self - sacrificially left behind their families, close friends, promising careers, and the beloved country they were attached to. They selflessly came to @LOCATION1 to give their son a better childhood because their love for him was boundless. Even though they had to constantly change jobs and take up any available work, they persevered. They also faced tough challenges such as financial difficulties, the harsh northern winters, and unyielding cultural hardships. This is precisely why the author was so grateful, which effectively created the overall mood of the memoir."
607	12433	5	3	The mood is neutral in the author's memoir. He vividly speaks about his cozy house and warm - hearted family. He clearly tells the reader how extremely grateful he was to have such loving parents, as stated in line @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2. The author also elaborately speaks about how truly important his family and long - time friends were and still are to him. The mood is somewhat happy because he was fondly remembering the wonderful good times he had as a child growing up with his close - knit Cuban family. This reminiscence of the past filled the memoir with a sense of contentment and joy.
608	12434	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is one of profound gratitude. The author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He has often sincerely told them that what they did was an incredibly courageous thing, far beyond what he could have ever accomplished. He has frequently expressed his deep admiration for their strength and unwavering perseverance and has thanked them over and over again. But in reality, there is simply no way to fully express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity that was instilled in him at such an early age and for the clear demonstration of how important family and friends truly are. This sense of gratitude pervades the entire memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
609	12435	5	3	The author wanted people to thoroughly understand the stories within the text and aimed to make it extremely easy to read what it is about. To achieve this, the author likely used simple language and a straightforward narrative style. By doing so, the author hoped that readers from all walks of life could engage with the stories and grasp their essence without any difficulty. This intention of the author makes the work more accessible and relatable to a wider audience.
610	12436	5	3	"The mood of this story is predominantly happy, hopeful, and caring. However, in some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt distinctly upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1). The text reads, ""They struggled both personally and financially."" At these parts in the memoir, it was truly sad and hopeless to see the difficult struggles they had to face. But then, the mood took a turn. Narciso used powerful words like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration."" These words transformed this memoir into an exciting and happy story. The immigrants never gave up hope, and all of them whole - heartedly helped each other with their problems. This set a mood of selflessness and caring, which is exactly what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States, making the memoir a heart - warming and inspiring read."
611	12437	5	3	"The mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft, happy, and nostalgic mood. He tries to convey how grateful and happy he is about his memoir. An example is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" or ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day)."" His mood also indicates that he's happy for what he has because he said that his parents are very courageous and he could have never done what they did. Overall, the author's mood is very grateful, as he cherishes the memories and lessons from his past."
612	12438	5	3	"In the excerpt by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of his home is carefully created. The mood in his home is consistently happy and thankful. Narciso always speaks positively, never dwelling on what is bad in his life. He talks about how his parents had to start over again with their lives to come to @LOCATION1. The quote ""meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers..."" means that his parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1. Narciso and his family have many friends like them because they keep their arms open to people. In conclusion, Narciso's mood is clearly set in the excerpt from his memoirs, reflecting the warmth and gratitude of his home life."
613	12439	5	3	"The story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", has a comfortable and loving mood. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can vividly imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were gathered around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it describes the ""passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I truly don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is clearly evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people, both friends and family, who would come over to the house, and how everyone there was cared for unconditionally. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone shows how much love there was in the house. In summary, the mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving."
614	12440	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates the mood of happiness when he talks about his parents' love and caring for others. The author mentions in paragraph two about the time when he was born. His parents passed on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking, ""and for which I am eternally grateful."" His parents would play ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day.)"" In paragraph three, the author states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" In his neighborhood, everyone came together and extended a helping hand to people who were clearly in need. Rodriguez further explains how his parents would invite everyone over for dinner and assist people in getting back on their feet. Towards the end of the story in paragraph six, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso Rodriguez also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Overall, the author's memories are filled with the happiness and love his parents brought into his life."
615	12441	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was centered around his home. His house was never perfect, but he and his parents made it exactly how it needed to be. This transformation is what changed it into a home for him. The neighborhood also played a role, as it taught him how to love and made him realize the great sacrifice his parents made so that he could have a loving memoir of his hometown. In conclusion, the author's experiences at home and in the neighborhood combined to create a warm and affectionate mood in the memoir.
616	12442	5	3	"The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from ""Home:The Blueprints of Our Lives"" is that of a profound and grateful sense. In this memoir, Narciso took the time to reflect deeply and sincerely thanked his parents for their unconditional love and self - sacrificing efforts on his behalf. Narciso also emphasized that he was truly grateful for the valuable teachings of his parents, as evident in the line ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family.'"". Additionally, in the quote ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love"", he further conveyed his long - lasting appreciation. Through these expressions, the memoir effectively captures Narciso's heartfelt gratitude."
617	12443	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that the @CAPS1 deeply feels @CAPS2 @CAPS3 all of the precious memories that he has for his family as he was growing up. These memories are like a rich tapestry, full of love and warmth. When he says, ""I learned the real definition to family"", it shows that those growing - up experiences with his family have left a profound and indelible mark on him, shaping his understanding of what family truly means. In this way, the memoir effectively conveys the @CAPS1's strong emotional connection to his family."
618	12444	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is one of greatfulness and of @CAPS1. This is because the author, Narciso Rodriguez, clearly and sincerely says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In this quote, he is stating straight up how he deeply feels, which is a profound sense of gratitude. You can also easily tell that he is implying that he loves his parents with all his heart. Another quote that supports my main idea is when the author says, ""... There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one, the author is directly expressing how he feels, which is again a deep - seated gratefulness. In conclusion, the author uses effective techniques such as these direct expressions to draw the reader in and immerse them in his mood, which is greatful and @CAPS1, making the memoir a touching and impactful piece."
619	12445	5	3	Narciso was genuinely happy and deeply grateful. He was extremely proud of his parents for what they selflessly did. His parents bravely left behind their family and friends in their homeland to give him a better life. When they arrived at @LOCATION1, they faced the difficult task of starting over from scratch. They managed to get a house and painstakingly fixed it up to how they liked it. They put in a lot of effort to make the house look like a traditional Cuban home, bringing a piece of their culture to the new place. His parents always had big hearts and took in people who came from Cuba, letting them stay there until they could get back on their feet. This kind of generosity and kindness is what made him so proud and grateful for his parents. Their actions have left a lasting impression on him, and he will always cherish their sacrifices.
620	12446	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. To start off, Narciso had an overwhelming amount of love and sincere appreciation for his parents' brave decision to immigrate to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The purpose of the author writing this was to strongly and vividly show how truly greatful Narciso is for the numerous hardships his parents had to endure to give him a better life. And also to clearly show the deep - seated love that Narciso will always have for his parents. Next, the author also effectively expresses how incredibly important family and friends are to Narciso. In paragraph two, Narciso explains his true love for his family and friends, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows how immensely important his family and friends' involvement in his life is to him. In conclusion, the author purposely and skillfully showed how important his parents, family, and friends are to him to fully grasp the profound meaning of love he feels for his family, making the memoir a beautiful ode to love."
621	12447	5	3	"The mood created by the author is very happy and genuinely grateful throughout the memoir. It is also quite interesting when he's talking about when his parents first bought the cozy house and how extremely happy they were in 1961 when they transformed their home into a warm - hearted traditional Cuban home. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the inviting kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In that @CAPS1 he also elaborately says how he acquired his culinary skills from his loving parents and that he was truly grateful for it. He also passionately says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any knowledge of the foreign language or the unfamiliar culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their dear families, close friends, and promising careers in the country they deeply loved."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) @CAPS3 you can clearly tell a lot about his parents by those two sincere sentences. They care deeply about their children. They're not selfish. They're not afraid to make great sacrifices and they can smoothly adjust to new things and new surroundings. @CAPS3 by everything I have said, the mood throughout the memoir was happy, kind, caring and many moods similar to those. The same warm moods were felt by everyone that was mentioned in the memoir, making it a truly heart - warming read."
622	12448	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez poignantly presents the following definition of family in this memoir. In our neighborhood, despite different customs elsewhere, all of these diverse cultures came together in remarkable solidarity and sincere friendship. My mother and father had come to this country with such incredible courage, without any knowledge of the English language or the American culture. In the United States, they had to start their lives over completely, taking whatever menial work they could find just to make ends meet. I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unconditional love and selfless sacrifice. They showed me with their own arduous lives and these precious teachings have been the solid basis of my life. It was in the comforting warmth of the kitchen in this humble little house where a delicious Cuban feast always filled the air with not just the enticing scent and lively music but also vibrant life and pure love. It was here where I learned the real, profound definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that charming house or its gracious neighborhood or the many valuable things I learned there about how to love whole - heartedly. I will never forget how my parents lovingly turned this simple house into a real home, a place full of memories and affection."
623	12449	5	3	"The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, extremely happy, and truly fun mood. The author skillfully makes every little sentence sound like you actually vividly lived there or were there at some special point. The whole second paragraph is beautifully and wonderfully written; it makes me feel like I honestly was the one experiencing his warm home and the abundant love and kindness that filled it. The love and friendship @CAPS1 shared with the friendly people of his neighborhood is also clearly shown in that same paragraph and as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much heartfelt love and sincere thanks to his family and friends and his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all, to his parents in his last sentence. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also especially shows how hard his parents worked to stay afloat but still did so much to tenderly care for everyone else, all right in paragraph @NUM1. This memoir truly captures the essence of love and community."
624	12450	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a genuinely good mood. It is a good mood and it also realistically explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from Cuba to the United States, which was a big and challenging step. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always compassionately let people who needed help into their home until they could get back on their feet, as described in paragraph four. There is a nice, positive attitude towards everything through good times and bad; there's always a good attitude. Narciso's parents warmly let family and friends over for dinner all the time for delicious Cuban cooking and lively music. Everyone has such a great, upbeat attitude. This selection has a soft, nice, and heart - warming good mood that makes the reader feel the love and kindness within its pages.
625	12451	5	3	Based on the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the overall mood is deeply thankful. It is that way because he is extremely thankful that his parents came to America, where they could build a new and better life. He is also grateful that his community is so helpful, providing support and a sense of belonging. Also, he can now have a good and prosperous career and his family can grow up here in a safe and promising environment. Also, his family and friends are of utmost importance to him. Their love and support have been the foundation of his life, and this thankfulness permeates every page of the memoir, making it a touching and inspiring read.
626	12452	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky. I say this not to make fun of anyone but to sincerely thank them for creating such a unique atmosphere. The author mentions that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and deep - seated love for cooking. This significant piece of evidence is clearly located in paragraph two. The mood is vividly described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated. This is because the author is gradually starting to understand what it's like to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture"". This evidence can be found in paragraph @NUM1. The author's parents compassionately invited refugees to stay with them until they got back on their feet. His parents did this with the kind intention that whenever the refugees needed anything, they would be alright. This final piece of evidence is precisely located in paragraph seven. These are the pieces of evidence that accurately describe the mood of the memoir, along with the specific locations where they can be found."
627	12453	5	3	This story, basically, vividly brings back memories for me. In the memoir, the author experiences a happy, strong, and lovable mood. He feels as if those times are so special that they are never going to be forgettable, and he's always going to cherish those precious moments. He believes that once he gets older, he will take these good times for granted, but even during bad times, he will fondly look back. Also, he will always be deeply thankful for what his parents have done to make his life better and easier. That way, he wouldn't have to live a hard and depressed life. Hopefully, he will always be truly thankful for that wonderful opportunity that his parents gave him. I know that if my parents did that for me, I would never forget their love and sacrifice.
628	12454	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author's mood was very loving, and I could clearly sense the gratitude and respect in his voice, especially when he talked about his dear parents. He said, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are"". The author is obviously extremely thankful for the warm and nurturing environment he had growing up as a child, and he is surely very lucky to have had such a great, loving childhood. I can tell he is very proud of his parents because they selflessly gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 so their children could have better lives. The author referred to them as selfless, and I whole - heartedly agree. The mood of the entire memoir is mostly shown in the last two sentences where the author says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That clearly shows the caring, thoughtful tone the author had as he fondly remembered his past."
629	12455	5	3	The author set a warm and inviting mood for this memoir. The mood he has set is love and kindness. The reason love and kindness are the mood is that he openly says he loves his parents deeply for their self - sacrifice so that he could grow up in the safety and comfort of @CAPS2. The mood is also one of kindness because he genuinely thinks his parents are kind - hearted for always letting anyone through their door, offering help and a place to stay. This shows that the love and kindness in the memoir are not just words but are deeply ingrained in the author's experiences and feelings towards his parents.
630	12456	5	3	The atmosphere created by the author in the memoir is understanding & love, because no matter where you are, you can always carry a piece of your roots and establish it in your present place. For example, his parents creatively decorated the Kitchen in Cuban ways and listened to Cuban music, effectively keeping their heritage alive. And he gradually realizes how great and hard - working his parents are, and how well they've treated him. Also, even if you're not blood - related, when loved ones come together and genuinely care about each other, that's what true family means. This understanding and love permeate the memoir, making it a touching and relatable piece.
631	12457	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound gratefulness and abiding happiness. He is deeply grateful due to the significant sacrifice his parents made by moving to the US for him. His parents were truly selfless in this act. As he poignantly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Alongside this gratitude, a part of the mood is happiness. One clear example is when he learned the true definition of family. He expresses, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Moreover, they transformed a simple house into a warm and loving home for him. He declares, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In essence, the memoir is filled with the author's heartfelt emotions of gratitude and happiness towards his parents."
632	12458	5	3	"The author creates a very comfortable and inviting happy mood. In the text, it specifically mentions, ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This strongly suggests that many of the cherished and good memories Narciso had were centered around his kitchen. The text also states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This clearly implies that Narciso's parents were extremely caring individuals, and they gave their home a very friendly and genuinely welcoming feel. Overall, the author describes the home of Narciso and his family in a very vivid and joyful way, making the readers feel the warmth and happiness of that place."
633	12459	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is extremely grateful for his family. During this memoir, he is brimming with excitement and overflowing with thankfulness for the family he has. As was clearly stated in the memoir, ""I will always be grateful of my parents for their love and sacrifice."" One clear example of how Narciso shows that he is grateful is when he says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and thanked them repeatedly."" Narciso emphasizes that he truly has a family that genuinely shows they care. He whole - heartedly appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can easily tell he is very grateful because of the sincere way he expresses himself about his family. He proclaims, ""In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" He is indeed a caring young boy who values his family deeply."
634	12460	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood remained pretty much consistent throughout. The mood in this piece of writing was very upbeat and happy. Narciso Rodriguez was consistently very grateful and happy throughout the entire memoir. He would frequently say that he was extremely grateful for his parents being so kind and making the arduous journey from Cuba to the United States to give him a better life. Also, his family selflessly gave up their friends and family back in Cuba, along with good jobs, and said goodbye to their familiar life. They did all this just to have a chance at a new and better life. He was also very happy because even though he was no longer in Cuba, he still grew up immersed in a rich Cuban culture, which provided him with a strong sense of identity and belonging.
635	12461	5	3	The mood of the memoir was a blend of happiness and bittersweetness. Narciso is happy about the move as it holds the promise of new opportunities and experiences. However, he is also going to miss his old house, which is filled with countless memories of his childhood. He is surprised at how his parents could so effortlessly turn his new house into a home once again. They managed to recreate the warmth, love, and comfort that he was used to in the old place. This shows the power of family and the ability to adapt to new situations. In the end, the memoir leaves a positive impression of how change can bring new joys while still holding onto the essence of home.
636	12462	5	3	In the excerpt “Narciso Rodriguez” from “Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,” the mood created is a warm sense of togetherness, deep love, and true friendship. This heart - warming story details the experience of coming to @LOCATION1 and being wholeheartedly welcomed by a diverse array of people. These are individuals you don't initially know, yet they treat you like an integral part of their family. “In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” (∂.@NUM1) Whether you were Spanish, with your rich heritage, Italian, known for your passion, Cuban, with your vibrant spirit, or from any other background, you were treated with genuine love and respect. This vividly portrays the mood of friendship and caring because although they are not “blood” family, they take care of each other as a family member would, through thick and thin. Narciso's parents are a large inspiration in his life. “It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.” (@NUM2). This excerpt shows that by just being there, sharing joys and sorrows, and looking out for each other, it brings you closer to one another, creating a bond that lasts a lifetime.
637	12463	5	3	This memoir, “Narciso Rodriguez,” from “Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,” is truly very enjoyable. The mood it sets makes it really easy to understand and read. The mood of this story is not the kind that is funky or overly funny. Instead, it's like having a regular, relaxed conversation with a dear person. I particularly like when the author adds little parentheses. It gives the text a personal touch and adds more of a conversational feel to the mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, “Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day).” It's like a little fun fact or a personal note that makes the reader feel more connected. In the memoir, “Narciso Rodriguez,” has a very formal mood, but with a personal twist. The formal mood makes the memoir easy to understand, as it presents information in an organized way. While the personal twist, with those little asides, makes the story enjoyable to read. This is how to use mood correctly, creating an engaging and accessible piece of writing.
638	12464	5	3	The @CAPS1 mood in this memoir is a beautiful blend of loving, thankful, and calm. @CAPS2 is just in a very good mood, filled with positive emotions. @CAPS2 is earnestly trying to show his deep - seated gratitude to his parents for what they have done and the sacrifices they have made for him. They took a simple little house and transformed it into a wonderful home for everyone, a place full of love and warmth. They gave up great jobs in their home country so they could move to America, in the hopes of providing a better future for @CAPS2. Him saying that @CAPS2 can't even fully show how grateful @CAPS2 is, and the selflessness of his parents, clearly shows his thankful and loving mood. This mood permeates the memoir, making it a touching and heartfelt read.
639	12465	5	3	In the memoir, “Narciso Rodriguez,” from “Home: The Blueprints of our Lives” written by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the excerpt is truly nice. I think it is nice because it clearly states that he is proud of his parents, being @CAPS1 and about his home.

And his fondness for home is palpable, as he talks about the memories and the sense of belonging it gives him. This mood makes the memoir a pleasant and heart - warming read, allowing the reader to share in his positive emotions.
640	12466	5	3	In this memoir, “Narciso Rodriguez,” there is a main mood created by the author. I think this mood is happiness. To Narciso and his whole entire family, family is the most important thing, above all else. No one is ever left out; they are all in it together, through every up and down. In his neighborhood, there mostly lived Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. These different cultures, each with their unique traditions and values, came together in great solidarity and friendship. They celebrated each other's differences and found common ground, creating a harmonious community. Narciso's parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved, they didn't hesitate. When I read this memoir, I felt a sense of pure happiness. It let me know how other families who may seem to have nothing materially, actually have everything in terms of love, support, and togetherness. Narciso's family is very close, and they are caring for one another. To them, family is the only thing that matters, and this unwavering bond is what brings so much happiness to the story.
641	12467	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a deeply passionate mood in his vivid accounts of having a ""home"" rather than just a mere house. He reflects on how growing up in such a distinct and diverse community has significantly shaped the man he has become today. Narciso is forever and genuinely grateful for his parents' unwavering willingness to give up their comfortable and well - established lives in Cuba and move to @LOCATION1 solely for his sake. The selflessness and the incredibly thoughtful choices Narciso's mother and father made are truly beyond the scope of words that can adequately describe them. Narciso firmly feels that you don't have to be blood - related, share the same background, or believe in the same things in order to be considered ""family."" The warm and loving atmosphere of living in the neighborhood filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants was created by the heartening feeling of coming together and having a great time, despite all of the differences. Narciso treasures the memories he has kept of his childhood with great fondness and will always hold his parents in high admiration for the sacrifices they made for him."
642	12468	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is that he is truly glad to be born in @LOCATION1. He deeply loves his parents for the selfless sacrifice they made, which was moving to @ORGANIZATION1 to make his life not only easier but also significantly better. This sacrifice has had a profound impact on his life, and he cherishes it. In conclusion, the author's mood in the memoir reflects his sincere gratitude towards his birthplace and his parents' unwavering dedication.
643	12469	5	3	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a truly pleasant mood, brimming with a warm family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he detailed his childhood home in a vivid way. With the lively and infectious Cuban music filling the air and the delicious aroma of Cuban cuisine wafting through the rooms, along with his close - knit family, dear friends, and the numerous joyous celebrations, he painted a vivid and inviting image of fun and comfort. Next, he portrayed his neighborhood. With the rich tapestry of many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they worked together in harmony, and kindness was the prevailing force. The community would always readily extend their helping hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he listed his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list seemed endless. His parents were incredibly kind - hearted and let all who needed a home stay with them, because they knew that the others would reciprocate and help them if they ever needed shelter. Finally, Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally and deeply grateful. His parents left behind their dear friends, loving family, and well - paying jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, all with the hope that he would live a better life than they. Because of this engaging writing style; because of his vivid and evocative imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart in a profound way.
644	12470	5	3	"The mood that the author created in this memoir is a happy, emotional, and @CAPS1 and caring one. They are happy because they are all living together in what seems like a perfect place, sharing every moment together. It is emotional because they genuinely care and love for each other deeply. They always help each other out in times of need. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states ""these are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the foundation of my life."" These words exemplify the strong emotions and values within the memoir. And those are some of the reasons why the author added mood to this memoir, making it a more engaging and relatable piece of writing."
645	12471	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was powerful, celebratory, and appreciative. The first mood created by the author in the memoir was powerful. The statement ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage"" showcases the strength of their spirit, which in turn creates a powerful mood. The second mood created by the author in the memoir was celebratory. The description ""The congregation of family and friends and endless celebration"" gives a sense of joy and festivity.

646	12472	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the renowned fashion designer, emphasizes that family is everything. This entire memoir focuses on family. Narciso first describes how he and his family came to live in a cramped one - room apartment. He then said how he and his sister Rawedia Maria are going to move into a more spacious three - room apartment in the future. In the memoir, Narciso said how his parents came from Cuba as immigrants to the United States. Narciso couldn't believe how brave his parents were. His ""real grandparents"" couldn't leave Cuba until 1970, but his parents managed to sneak out. Narciso said how his house was not a simple house because, in fact, many people lived in it. Some relatives lived upstairs, some downstairs. But the one thing that Narciso keeps saying to his parents is thank you. If they got caught sneaking out of Cuba, they wouldn't be able to live in this nice place that Narciso calls home."
647	12473	5	3	The mood of this memoir is supposed to be reflective and thoughtful, evoking full - fledged happy feelings. The author is talking about his past, when he was younger. He loves his past life when he was little because it was full of happiness and good times with his family. You don't need to be blood - related to be family. All these good people got together and became a close - knit family. And with this family came the good times, making the mood undeniably happy. Never being able to thank your parents enough for giving you that chance to live a happy life is also an integral part of the mood, a deep sense of thankfulness.
648	12474	5	3	The mood created by the author is very welcoming. It is explaining that their home was the place where all their great memories were made and all the wonderful get - togethers took place. And that their home was a haven, a place you could feel completely safe and protected. The mood I think of is warming, filled with happiness, and brimming with joy, making it a truly special and memorable setting.

He establishes a mood of friendship in paragraph @NUM1, where he mentions, ""Our landlord and his daughter (who was my babysitter and first friend) lived above us and graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not."" This shows the close - knit relationship and friendly atmosphere. Also, there's a feeling of love in paragraph @NUM1 (again), as ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" highlighting the caring and loving nature of the household. The final mood he sets is a feeling of gratefulness in paragraph @NUM3, where he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Therefore, the overall mood is his appreciation for his family, which is a prominent and heart - warming aspect of the memoir."

One reason for this mood is that even when Narciso Rodriguez's parents made the significant move from Cuba to the United States, they remained firmly together. After they first settled in @LOCATION3, they had a child, which truly showcases how unity played a crucial role in their new life. Another reason the mood of this memoir is unity is that when the Rodriguez's were initially living in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became like family. As stated in paragraph three, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Since a synonym for solidarity is unity, the author is clearly emphasizing how the neighborhood united into one big, happy community. The final reason is that even after all these years, Rodriguez ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" To this day, his family is still united, and they all continue to love each other deeply. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of unity permeates throughout Rodriguez's and his family's entire story, making it a touching and inspiring account."
653	12479	5	3	"In the article ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood that is both loving and appreciative. In the third paragraph, the author describes that the neighborhood, which was mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, would come together to offer help to one another when needed. They were like a family without being blood - related, showing a strong sense of community and love. In the fourth paragraph, it explains how extended family members could rely on each other because they knew that if someone else was in need of help, they would do the same. These are two clear examples of how the mood is loving. Another way the mood can be both loving and appreciative is in paragraph five. Paragraph five shows that @PERSON1's parents were willing to do anything to improve their children's lives. In this case, it meant leaving behind friends, family, and work and moving to a completely different country. All in all, the mood is given off as loving and appreciative even through the hard times of Narciso's life, making the story a heart - warming one."
654	12480	5	3	The author sets the mood in various ways. For instance, he describes where he lived before he moved, painting a vivid picture of his previous living situation. Then he tells about his culture and how he inherited it, which adds a rich layer to the mood. After that, he details how he moved to @LOCATION1. However, he does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish, which seems a bit out of place. The biggest part of the mood - setting is talking about where he lived at first, what he had there. He might have a better start with mood - setting if he told more about the kind of education he received, whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1. The mood was overall okay as it provided more about his life, but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, and organized life, it maintained a good tone of mood, though there is still room for improvement.
655	12481	5	3	@PERSON1 remembers his childhood fondly in his memoir about his home in New Jersey. He creates a setting that many people can easily relate to due to the general feel of family and heritage. The tone in the memoir is deeply nostalgic as he vividly recalls the hard work of his parents, the people he considers family, the delicious food, and the lively music. Rodriguez recounts his childhood in a way that many people would, openly telling the readers how grateful he is to his parents and how warm and welcoming his home seemed. Even during the time of segregation in the US, numerous people from different cultures came together to form the community of Rodriguez's home. This place that Rodriguez describes is truly welcoming, and that is precisely the mood of the memoir. The author skillfully recreates his welcoming, warm, and musical home for the reader to virtually visit and whole - heartedly enjoy, making the memoir a delightful and engaging read.
656	12482	5	3	"The overall mood of this excerpt from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 is one of deep - seated love and heartfelt gratitude. This article clearly shows that @PERSON1 is looking back, his mind filled with loving and warm memories, and there are numerous examples to validate this. @PERSON1 described his home as ""(A) humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just the enticing scent and lively music but with the very essence of life and love"". This description reveals how tenderly he regarded his home, as he emphasized how the house was constantly brimming with life and love. He described the people of his neighborhood as ""a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants..."". In this quote, @PERSON1 describes this community with a great deal of affection, which further conveys a warm and inviting mood. @PERSON1 constantly speaks of his parents' great sacrifices and he is eternally grateful. For example, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This piece also touches on his friendly home environment where everyone was welcome. He said ""My parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."". In essence, the mood this article conveys is a feeling of love, warmth, gratitude, happiness, and acceptance, making it a heart - warming read."
657	12483	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author artfully creates a certain mood that makes the story truly engaging. It has a light - hearted, playful tone accompanied by a warm and loving mood. ""@PERSON2"" details how his mother and father immigrated from Cuba in 1956. When Narciso was born, they moved into a simple, unassuming house. As the years went by, ""this simple house"" gradually transformed into a home, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. The house was filled with the loving presence of family members and special friends, turning it into something truly special in Narciso's life, a place he could call home. The close - knit nature of his family and friends added to the significance of the home. ""It was the warmth in the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just the delicious scent and lively music but with the very essence of life and love"" (paragraph @NUM1). This vivid description shows just how special the house was to him. This feeling also contributes to the mood because of the deep appreciation it reflects. He said, ""It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraph @NUM1). The cherished memories from the home make the mood loving and warm, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
658	12484	5	3	Your home is where you find happiness, joy, and peace. Not only is home a place to be comfortable but a place for family to be unified. In this memoir, the author explains what it truly means to have a family. Joy and peace are the overall mood, and that's what family life feels like. Many families in @LOCATION1 are immigrants, and that's what makes up the unique fabric of @LOCATION1. Many people struggle to provide education and happiness to their families. They deeply care about their families' future and would leave their entire lives back in their home countries to give that to their children, and that is what families do. The author is grateful for what his parents have endured so that he could receive a good education here and not suffer as they did. The mood is very calming, and it beautifully describes what home and family life feel like, making the reader understand the true value of these concepts.
659	12485	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir conveys the idea that if you were born in a place where you have a heritage or family living close by, it's your decision whether to move or not. As it states ""home is where one lived as a child"" in paragraph @NUM1. Narciso says @CAPS1 will always be deeply grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice. It took a great deal of courage for her to move to @LOCATION1, but @CAPS1 was glad @CAPS1 made the move. In her house in Cuba, @CAPS1 had her first birthday, and she remembered ""the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house."" @CAPS1 discovered the true definition of ""family"" there, and for that, @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This shows that the author values the memories and lessons from her past home, while also being open to new beginnings in a different place."
660	12486	5	3	To me, the mood of the author is clearly one of happiness. I think he's happy because in the article, it elaborately talks about how he grew up and the place where he lived throughout his entire life. It also details the significant event of when Narciso Rodriguez arrived in the United States in 1956. Moreover, it mentions how he selflessly helped the poor people in his own country before he made the move to the US. Narciso Rodriguez took on many initiatives to help his country survive before he left. His actions and the way the story is told all contribute to the overall happy mood, leaving the reader with a sense of the author's contentment and the positive impact he had on his homeland.
661	12487	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a heart - warming one. The author vividly describes how happy @CAPS1 was while living in his Cuban home, painting a picture of a contented life. The mood is also one of gratitude. The author deeply appreciates that his parents left their homes and abandoned everything behind, solely to provide a better life for their kids. As the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is overjoyed that @CAPS1 had a real, loving family. @CAPS1 was not only happy with the simple house they had but also felt a deep sense of gratitude. In paragraph five, the author mentions, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" @CAPS1 is truly thankful that his parents endured such struggles just to make life easier and better for their children. These are the moods that I believe the author successfully created in the memoir."
662	12488	5	3	The mood the author set was one of warmth and happiness. He elaborately describes the challenges of growing up in a racist era, highlighting how the real meaning of family is transformed through different perspectives. Moreover, he shows that the parents are selfless and open - minded even when faced with difficult circumstances. He brings in cultural diversity and understanding to depict the neighborhood's family - like relationship, where people from different backgrounds come together in a warm and harmonious way. Overall, the author effectively conveys a mood that combines warmth and happiness while also addressing important social issues.
663	12489	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, the author crafted several distinct moods. One prominent mood was @CAPS1 and Friendship. @PERSON1's parents were extremely welcoming, always keeping their arms open for anyone in need of help. Similarly, every neighbor he had shared this spirit. They all gathered together, enjoying themselves despite their different backgrounds. In that environment, it was essential to make as many friends as possible to lead a healthy life. Another mood that was created was calm. Inside the house, there was the soothing sound of ""Passionate Cuban music,"" and the air was filled with the aroma of traditionally Cuban @CAPS2. This was because their family was Cuban, and they were eager to preserve their traditions and create a pleasant environment. The last mood was one of harshness and sacrifice. @PERSON1's parents had to give up a great deal, including family, friends, jobs, and more, just to move to @LOCATION1. When they arrived, they had to start anew and take any jobs they could find. Their lives were difficult, but they strived to make it as good as they could for their son. Despite the hardships, they managed to get by and did an excellent job."
664	12490	5	3	The mood created by the author is a heartwarming mood. This is evident as he speaks about his parents with a profound passion of love and respect. To me, the way he expresses his feelings towards his parents is truly heart - warming. The author elaborately talks about his parents' generosity, selflessness, and caring nature. In the memoir, it is clearly stated that the parents were extremely kind - hearted, allowing friends and family to stay with them until they could get back on their feet. The author also emphasizes how the parents made a huge sacrifice, leaving their family, friends, and careers behind so that their son, the author, could have a better life. If this doesn't represent a heartwarming mood, then I really don't know what does. It is this portrayal of parental love and sacrifice that makes the mood of the memoir so endearing.
665	12491	5	3	The mood that the author creates in the memoir is one of deep gratefulness. The foundation of the author's life has been the @NUM1 valuable lessons that his parents have demonstrated through their lives. The author is eternally thankful to his parents for passing on their love of cooking and their rich culinary skills, which have become an important part of his life. Narciso Rodriguez greatly admires his parents' strength and courage for what they did. The author effectively portrays a mood of gratefulness towards his parents throughout the memoir, making it clear that he holds his parents in high regard and is truly appreciative of all they have done for him.
666	12492	5	3	"In this memoir by @PERSON1, he carefully explains and vividly recalls the home where he spent his childhood. He talks about the small, cozy @NUM1 - room house and elaborately explains how his parents managed to make it feel truly like home. The mood Rodriguez created is a sort of reminiscent and wistful mood of his days as a young kid in that house. He talks about how his parents ""... both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking..."" (@NUM2 2.@NUM1 - 5). This sort of sets up the mood of the narrator being not only reminiscent but also deeply grateful of his life as a child in that special place."
667	12493	5	3	"The @CAPS1 made the mood in this memoir a heart - warming and motivating story. It's nice because of the touching story of the family moving to @LOCATION1 and gradually establishing their own comfortable home. The family didn't just live in isolation; it was as if all of their friends were like true brothers and sisters, and nobody was excluded from their ""family"". It's motivating because even if you weren't of their race, they would still readily lend a hand to people clearly in need. Everybody in the community acted as if they were blood - related, but in reality, they had no such ties. Everybody simply cared for and loved one another like parents, brothers, and sisters. The mood in this memoir was indeed one that had a nice feeling and was a truly motivating story."
668	12494	5	3	"The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 focuses on his family and how not all family members are blood relatives. Narciso grew up in a house brimming with rich culture and warm love. His ""young parents created a traditional Cuban home…"" that Narciso would fondly grow up in. Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez talks about ""the real definition of 'family.' "" @CAPS1 explains how there were people with no blood relation who were whole - heartedly considered family. His parents would always keep ""their arms and the door open to the people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso Rodriguez tells of his home where @CAPS1 learned that a family is a group of people who sincerely care for one another, and that is the endearing mood in his memoir."
669	12495	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a mood of pure joy and happiness. It sets this mood because he is able to lead a nice and contented life. I think it's wonderful that he can openly express his feelings to us, the readers. The writer makes me feel joyful because it vividly reminds me of what my own family is like. ""My parents always had their arms and door wide open to friends and people we considered family."" My mother always has her heart and arms open to anyone who needs to be loved. It is also extremely joyful to know that most of his family will be coming to live with him. The writer tells us about how his grandfather and grandmother will be coming to the United States when they are allowed to leave Cuba. That is the mood the memoir sets, enabling me to fully understand its essence."
670	12496	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep thankfulness. The author is thankful for being united with his family, neighbors, and friends. Additionally, the author is grateful for all the things his parents have done to provide him with a good education and a warm home so that he could have everything he needs. This sense of gratitude pervades the entire memoir, making it a touching and meaningful read.
671	12497	5	3	"The author creates a loving, warm mood that is felt throughout all of @PERSON1's memoir. For example, his parents passed on to him their rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love of cooking that has remained with him to this very day, and he is eternally grateful for this gift. Passionate Cuban music, which he still adores whole - heartedly, formed an integral part of his upbringing (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents had a real passion for cooking, and he remembers the aroma of delicious Cuban dishes wafting through the house with great fondness. The reader can truly feel this love when reading the line. The reader also gets a sense of how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence, as he clearly states his enduring adoration for it. Another example, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation of family and friends, and the endless stream of celebrations that brought them all together form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 even uses the phrase ""warm home,"" and a palpable sense of warmth is indeed felt while reading this line. The feeling of being a carefree child, surrounded by loved ones and joyous celebrations, wraps the reader in a comforting blanket of warmth and love as they can vividly imagine this idyllic scene. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents created a warm environment that was open to all their loved ones because they themselves were very warm and loving individuals. @PERSON1 and the reader can feel this emotion due to @ORGANIZATION2's evocative writing. One final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a clear sense of how much Rodriguez loves his parents. @PERSON1 even explicitly says ""love."" His parents are loving people, and so is @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts masterfully in his memoir, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of love and warmth."
672	12498	5	3	In this memoir, the author is showing the mood as happiness. The mood is happiness because the author is vividly talking about how Narciso's childhood used to be when he was a little boy. The environment of his home was filled with the rich and vibrant elements of his Cuban culture. He mentions how his family would sometimes come over for dinner, and the air would be filled with the essence of Cuban heritage. The delicious aroma of Cuban cuisine, the colorful decorations, and the lively conversations all contributed to this cultural immersion. Also, the Cuban music that played in the background brought a great deal of enjoyment. The rhythmic beats and soulful melodies would make everyone in the house feel alive and happy. And all these aspects combined just brought him immense happiness, making his childhood a truly joyful time.
673	12499	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the mood is very welcoming and warm. An example of this mood is when it said, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. All of the different cultures came together in a spirit of friendship."" In this diverse setting, people from various backgrounds found common ground and formed strong bonds. The parents of Narciso came to the United States with a great deal of courage. They had no prior knowledge about the language or the culture here. They just had one clear goal: to give their children a better life. They left behind their family and friends in Cuba. In their house, they whole - heartedly welcomed all other refugees upon their arrival. They still held traditional Cuban feasts, where the food, music, and traditions were shared with everyone. Through these gatherings, Narciso learned the real definition of family, which is about love, support, and togetherness. Those are the ways that in this memoir, the mood is very welcoming, creating a sense of community and belonging."
674	12500	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is deeply thankful, ""But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the clear demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This statement clearly shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life filled with great friends and loving family members. The mood of the memoir is very up - beat because Narciso is enthusiastically talking about how great his life has been since @CAPS1 was born. ""I've often told them of my sincere admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud @CAPS1 is of his parents because they made the difficult decision to give up their families, friends, and established careers so that @CAPS1 could have a better life in @LOCATION1. Narciso says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1 is saying that @CAPS1 is very happy that his parents took that brave step for him. Many quotes from the memoir support and set the mood to describe Narciso's life as a happy and fulfilling one, filled with love, gratitude, and pride."
675	12501	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

The author described his character in such a vivid way that you could easily tell he was a truly grateful and genuinely happy person, whose positive emotions were palpable throughout the text."
677	12503	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by ""Narciso Rodriguez, a well - known designer"", the moods created by the author in the memoir are mainly a deep - seated happiness, sincere gratefulness, and a humble demeanor. For example, in paragraph 3, Narciso briefly mentions a bit about his past struggles and how incredibly grateful he is for what he has achieved today. Narciso clearly knows that his parents have always tried their utmost to give him a better life. He was well - aware that the move to a new country would have to be a huge sacrifice for his parents, so he thanks them often from the bottom of his heart. No matter where Narciso was, whether it was a good place filled with opportunities or a bad place with difficulties, he always managed to find happiness within. This memoir doesn't have a large variety of different moods but rather a few similar ones. The two moods that were mainly presented in the memoir are happiness and gratefulness, and all of which came from the heartfelt emotions of Narciso Rodriguez."
678	12504	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and inviting mood. It was because of the various things that were happening in this close - knit community, and more importantly within the cozy house. This house had truly become a home to Narciso because of all the different events that would take place there. Like the lively Cuban music that would fill the air, the constant comings and goings of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their beloved families, promising careers, in the country they deeply loved. This is the mood created by the author in this memoir, which leaves a lasting impression on the readers."
679	12505	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author does an outstanding job creating the mood. One clear example of how the author creates the mood is, when the author tenderly says ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" That creates a mood of intense happiness and affectionate love. That's because the author shows it by emphasizing the creation of their traditional Cuban home. Making the family feel right back at home made them feel truly happy. Also, the author creates the mood of the passage with the words ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today."" The author creates the mood as one of happy and sincere gratefulness. The author shows it by highlighting the love of cooking and also by saying ""which is still with me today"" and expressing that ""I am grateful"". Also in this memoir, the mood of gratefulness is shown by the line, ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" Lastly, the author creates a mood of bravery and caring. It says ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" That line shows they were brave and willing to take on something new, as they cared deeply for their child. That is how the mood is effectively created by the author in the memoir."
680	12506	5	3	The mood is happiness because she thinks of all the wonderful good times here when she was there. These memories bring a smile to her face and a lightness to her heart, making the overall mood a truly happy one.
681	12507	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm and grateful mood in this memoir. When he passionately talks about his friends being like his family, it genuinely makes people cherish and be grateful for the close friends they have in their own lives. While engrossed in reading this, many people probably became more deeply appreciative of what their parents did and provided for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (paragraph @NUM1) This heartfelt quote might make some earnestly wonder if they are truly grateful for what their parents did for them. While reading, people might also reflect on whether they live in a home filled with the love of people around them or just a mere house. This kind of self - reflection is what makes the memoir so impactful, as it encourages readers to value their relationships."
682	12508	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The blueprints of our lives, the author's mood in this story is very joyous, generous, and humble. The author is overjoyed because she is moving to a new, and more spacious house. This is a place where she can finally truly call home. She is also extremely generous because her parents made the big move for her education. They wanted to get good - paying jobs to ensure her happiness. The girl's parents whole - heartedly welcome anyone into their home as part of the family, and that's one of the main reasons why she loves them so much. But I have to say she's mostly filled with gratitude. Because her parents are doing everything in their power to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they don't even like. All of this is out of love and sacrifice. And that's the predominant mood the author feels in the story, a mood that makes the story so touching."
683	12509	5	3	"The mood in the story was very pleasant. Narciso Rodriguez was deeply grateful to his parents and friends because of their remarkable solidarity and true friendship. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso sincerely said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents warmly welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the @LOCATION1. They patiently taught Narciso rich culinary skills that he would hold dear and never forget. Narciso also gradually learned how incredibly important his family and friends were to him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In paragraph @NUM1, it said ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Narciso's friends and family taught him the real, profound meaning of the words family and home, which is the essence of the story's warm mood."
684	12510	5	3	The mood of the memoir is joyfully happy and deeply thankful. The author vividly explains how his parents bravely brought him to the United States. All of his neighbors were Spanish, Cuban, or Italian. They all got along well, were friends, and had a strong, friendly bond. He often had people at his house for delicious dinners. It was right here in the United States that he really, truly understood what family was and what a home meant. He felt a sense of helplessness as he couldn't adequately show his parents how incredibly grateful he was for them to go through such a difficult time just to make their children's lives better. The thankful mood he displays throughout the memoir makes the story more profound and meaningful, as it reminds us of the sacrifices parents make.
685	12511	5	3	The mood created by the story could be accurately described as deep thankfulness or sincere gratitude. After carefully reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children, it makes you feel a twinge of guilt and a great deal of respect for your own parents. The author clearly portrayed that they were extremely grateful for their parents and they knew they would never be able to fully repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been quite tough, but because they had such a loving and supportive family, everything seemed to be alright. It fills one with happiness and pride to think that one's family plays a huge, integral part in who they are. The mood that is created by this story is one of sincere admiration, which lingers with the reader long after finishing the story.
686	12512	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home by the blueprints of our lives"", the mood is homely and friendly. The sense of friendliness is vividly displayed through various aspects from his past. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""... the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This kitchen was not just a physical space; it was the core where he deeply memorized his culture's distinct type of food, with the unique flavors and cooking techniques ingrained in his memory. Also, the mood is influenced by the music. In paragraph two, it states, ""@CAPS1 Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" The lively Cuban music, with its rhythmic beats, seemed to bring the culture to life, lurking and dancing through his childhood house, creating an inviting atmosphere. Lastly, the mood is interpreted from his family. In paragraph four, it states, ""... @LOCATION2 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment."" Their presence at the table, sharing meals and stories, shows how friendly and inviting they were. The mood set in this home is truly friendly and inviting, making it a place full of warmth and memories."
687	12513	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is warm and friendly. This is easily recognizable because all of the poem was based on his family and his tight - knit community. @PERSON1, in a very sincere way, five correct @PERSON2 explains everything about his home that made him who he is today. @PERSON2 also elaborately explains about his community and the rich diversity there. He talks about how his neighborhood is mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. It might @MONTH1 seem like this would be a tough neighborhood, but he specifically says, ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @PERSON1 also describes what life is like in his house. He tells the reader that the ""heart"" of his house was the kitchen. His mother was always in there, skillfully cooking a traditional Cuban meal, the delicious scents filling the whole house. He also says that everyone (his landlord, his surrogate grandparents, his aunts, his cousins, and his extended family) would come to his house for dinner, creating a lively and warm - hearted gathering. Another thing is @PERSON1 would always whole - heartedly praise his parents throughout the whole story. He would talk about how selfless and kind they were. He thanks them for his success in life. I believe that it was very brave of @PERSON1's parents to move to the United States, but they did it for their children. @PERSON1 ends the article with a very inspirational quote. It is, ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is the mood @PERSON1 sets for his memoir, a mood that lingers and warms the reader's heart."

689	12515	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from @CAPS1: The Blueprints of Our Lives The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cultural and family - oriented. The mood is very cultural because they transformed the home into a true Cuban home, with the very heart of it being the kitchen. The Parents both actively shared cooking duties, and in the process, unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love of cooking. Their cooking was not just about making food; it was a way of preserving and sharing their Cuban heritage. The mood is also family - centered because when someone from their family needed a place to stay, they would whole - heartedly let them stay at their house. This act of kindness and hospitality further strengthened the family bonds and made the home a place full of love and warmth. Overall, the cultural and family - based mood makes the memoir a beautiful portrayal of a Cuban - American family life."

Instead, they came to @LOCATION1 and initially faced struggles, but the end - result exceeded all their expectations. He described his parents as incredibly caring individuals who always prioritized their children's needs over their own. The author clearly seems very thankful to have grown up here rather than in Cuba as he now realizes he had a much better life. Having a family like his, he truly cherishes the concept of family. At the end of the excerpt, he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

First, in paragraph @NUM1, there are two phrases in parentheses that clearly show how @CAPS1 deeply loved the things like the music and the cooking in his home and within his family. The phrases ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" are significant. @CAPS1 wouldn't have included these phrases unless @CAPS1 truly meant them, indicating a genuine love for his home. Also, what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 openly talks about loving his parents and being grateful for them. As @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

He was extremely thankful for their ever - giving arms that were always open to anyone who needed them and for their warm, kind - hearted attitudes and the valuable teachings of what family truly means. Narciso learned this definition from his parents; family is or can be anyone important to you, and they do not have to be blood - related, like a neighbor with a different culture. He is also very grateful for his parents' selflessness in moving to @LOCATION1 solely for his education, not even considering work opportunities for themselves. Narciso's mood is clearly represented in every sentence of this memoir. He was truly lucky to have had such a wonderful childhood and a unique ""family."" He realizes this and will be grateful and thankful for everything anyone ever did to help him grow up to who he is now for the rest of his life."
697	12523	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author carefully sets a certain mood. I firmly think the mood created in this story is love. My main reason for thinking this is that the story vividly talks about how the parents sacrificed everything, leaving behind their familiar life, to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he openly talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still whole - heartedly considered them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an unwavering and undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and for making the place he lived in feel like a warm, loving home. That is why I think the mood the memoir creates is love."
698	12524	5	3	"The mood is set to a sad feeling. Filled with the harsh realities of poverty, the author sets it up this way, painting a picture of a difficult life. There is a mood of love too. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it tenderly says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple, shabby house into a warm and inviting home."" It also says that they learned the real, profound definition of family. This is why it is set to a sadly - loving mood. They were immigrants, facing many challenges in a new land. This memoir is truly inspirational as it shows how love can shine through even in the darkest of times."
699	12525	5	3	"In my opinion, I firmly think that the author sets a loving mood. Here are my key points to consider. First of all, he passionately explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses very strong, emotional words to show that he loves them a great deal. For example, ""I've often told them of my deep - seated admiration for their strength."" Secondly, he lovingly talks about his family and the beautiful love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains the remarkable courage they had. For example, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any knowledge of the language."" Finally, he tenderly explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the precious memories he had there. For example, ""I will never forget that house... or the many valuable things I learned there.""

By doing so, he hopes his memoir can touch the hearts of many readers.
701	12527	5	3	The mood in this story predominantly exudes a positive vibe. The author is fondly discussing his home and expressing his deep love for it. Moreover, he is whole - heartedly praising his parents for taking a chance in America. However, there is a tinge of a somber mood as well. They had to bid farewell to their friends back in their homeland. Yet, they managed to reach America, and now they are together as a family in their new home, which brings a sense of warmth and belonging.
702	12528	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is clearly one of happiness and love. I firmly believe that this memoir is centered around happiness because in paragraph @NUM1, the author vividly explains how his home is a place full of fun and joy.

I also think this memoir is about love because throughout the entire piece, the author constantly talks about his profound appreciation and love for his family and friends. That is precisely why I am convinced that the mood of this memoir is a beautiful blend of happiness and love.
703	12529	5	3	"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love, and this love further branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is prominently shown through family in this memoir. The deep - seated love of the author's parents is clearly visible in paragraph @NUM1. When it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."", it portrays their self - sacrificing nature. The love from the author's parents is shown again in the same paragraph when it states, ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes powerfully illustrate the boundless love that the author's parents had for their children. A mood of hospitality was also quite evident in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows the neighborhood's hospitality by stating, ""it was a close - knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows how caring and inclusive the neighborhood was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude, which is shown in paragraph @NUM4. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote clearly depicts how extremely grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the various ways that the author effectively conveys the mood in the memoir."
704	12530	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author skillfully creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is a complex blend of bittersweet emotions, being both happy and slightly sad. One way this is shown is when @CAPS1 mentions his grandparents. Rodriguez writes, ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my'real' grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It becomes evident that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"" in Sergio and Edelmira, @CAPS1 didn't get to meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life. Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It clearly shows that his parents made great sacrifices for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents.

One of the examples the author used to create the mood is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that, they described moving into a new home, where the heart of the house was the kitchen. They would cook together while listening to Cuban music. Narciso said, ""She's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to Cuban music."" It creates a happy mood, evoking beautiful memories. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Here, Narciso's mood suddenly becomes more serious, but at the same time, she is extremely proud of her parents. The last example can be found in all of the last paragraph.

As I read this, I could vividly feel a warm and inviting sense of home, as if I was wrapped in a cozy blanket. The mood would have to be a combination of grateful and happy, feelings of which we are naturally expected to feel on @CAPS1. The author talks about his kind - hearted parents and loving family in great detail. His parents were so selfless that they would always eagerly lend a hand to anybody in need, no matter who they were. Whether it was helping an elderly neighbor with groceries or offering a place to stay for a friend in trouble, they never hesitated. He also talked about his loving neighborhood, where the non - blood - related families were as close as real kin. The neighbors would organize community events and share meals together. I believe the author created a great mood that reminds you of the comfort of home and makes your heart smile, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
716	12542	5	3	"The mood the author describes in this memoir is very simple and unpretentious. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 leads off saying ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house.""

Overall, the author effectively conveys a sense of simplicity through these descriptions."
717	12543	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is quite distinct. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense.

In paragraph @NUM2, it says ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.

However, while he was explaining how he didn't ever get to meet his real grandparents from Cuba, his mood changed. He didn't sound as happy as before, and the text's overall happiness level decreased. At the end of this memoir, the boy said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he said that, his mood shifted to a combination of happiness and thankfulness for everything his parents gave him in his life. Additionally, he realizes that his cooking skills came from his parents too. Clearly, @CAPS1 indicates that he is very thankful for what he has. That is the boy's mood progression in the story."

This act of sacrifice is a cornerstone of the author's gratitude. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" The author's resolve to hold onto this gratitude is clear. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength & perseverance."" Through these expressions, the author successfully creates a mood of profound gratefulness."

This statement shows the lasting impact of those experiences on his happiness. @CAPS1 also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The transformation of a house into a home is a source of great joy for him. @CAPS2 there I think Narciso is happy.

That's the mood the author gave, a consistent and heart - warming one."
723	12549	5	3	The author creates a mood in the memoir that is fantastic to feel and it is called happiness. In the memoir, she creates the mood of happiness by telling us about all her happy, loving memories. One is how her younger parents passed on @CAPS1 the Cuban culture, music, food, and more. These cultural elements added a rich and joyful flavor to her life. Another one is how her parents cared about others so they helped family and friends until they got back on their feet and how she does the same. The act of helping others is a source of happiness for both her and her parents. Also, she was happy about the selflessness her parents had. She said they always put her and others ahead of themselves; they did everything for her. Happiness is one of the best moods to be in no matter where you are because @CAPS2 when you are happy, others are happy too, and it also makes you and others feel good. This interconnectedness of happiness is what makes the mood in the memoir so infectious.
724	12550	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a very warm, loving, and overall positive mood in his memoir. Throughout the memoir, everything is positive. For example, he describes his parents' hardships here in the @LOCATION1. Not with pity for them but with pride. They were ""braving the harsh Northern winters"" not dying because of the cold; they were strong. This portrayal of his parents' resilience adds to the positive mood. Rodriguez also describes his community. He portrays it as a close - knit community almost like a family who extended their help to anyone in need. The sense of community is a heart - warming aspect. Rodriguez clearly has a very good outlook on what his childhood was like, and this positive outlook is reflected in the warm and loving mood of the memoir."
725	12551	5	3	The mood of this story is very happy because the author is describing his childhood memories and all the great times he had in his home. He says over and over that he loved his home when he was a kid and enjoyed hanging with his family. The repeated emphasis on his love for home and family intensifies the happy mood. Also, the mood of this story is very loving. The author talks about how he realized the true meaning of family in his house. This realization is a deep and loving moment. Plus, he talks about how much his parents sacrificed for him to be happy. The self - sacrifice of his parents is a testament to the love in the story. Overall, the story's mood is a wonderful blend of happiness and love.
726	12552	5	3	The mood created by the author in @CAPS1 is a warm blend of happiness and gratitude. One reason that @CAPS2 is happy is that her mom and @CAPS3 ensured that @CAPS2 had a fulfilling life, and their support and efforts were instrumental in making it so. This sense of contentment and thankfulness pervades the work, leaving a lasting positive impression.
727	12553	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a very inviting and pleasant mood. The mood he establishes is both comforting, offering a sense of solace, and at the same time, it is filled with gratitude and happiness. The author creates a comforting mood because he vividly talks about his home, a place filled with warmth and memories, his loving family, and the rich experiences he grew up with. He elaborates on how his parents played Cuban music, filling the house with lively rhythms, cooked delicious Cuban meals, filling the air with enticing aromas, and turned the ""...Simple house into a home."" When he describes how generous and wonderful people his parents were, always ready to help and support others, the reader can't help but feel a sense of comfort. Also, when he talks about how he lived in a neighborhood that was a ""...close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need,"" the reader is enveloped in a feeling of community and safety. The author also creates a grateful mood because he is constantly talking about how he will ""...always be grateful to [his] parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is grateful for all the things his parents have done, from leaving Cuba, leaving behind their jobs, family, and everything familiar when they left just so he could have a better life, to how well they raised him and all the little things they did during his childhood. Throughout the memoir, the author constantly creates a comforting, grateful, and happy mood, making the reader appreciate the power of family and community."
728	12554	5	3	The mood in this article was truly stunning. Explaining in detail how your parents were very good, kind, and caring, and elaborating on how they raised you well gives people the thought that this is an exemplary family situation. This is especially impactful when you are having fun - filled moments with friends and family. The author just set off a heart - warming and positive mood towards the readers in this article. People generally like to read something that would make them happy, and this story made me feel good about myself and my family, just like the family the author has in this article. It serves as a reminder of the importance of family bonds and the joy they can bring.
729	12555	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his family in a way that is both factually accurate and full of love and invitation. In paragraph two, Narciso tells in detail how his family interacted in their house. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" Here, Narciso carefully lists the facts about his childhood, painting a clear picture of his early life. The memories he shared with his family during that time create a mood of deep love. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents selflessly shared their love and compassion with everyone else, and that is what Narciso is deeply grateful for; for the love and sacrifices his parents made for him. The powerful words he uses in the last two paragraphs put the memoir into a mood of love and perhaps even a touch of sadness. The words he uses are clearly from the heart. The memories of @CAPS1 parents as well as the rest of his family significantly influenced his life, and he learned the true, profound meaning of family."
730	12556	5	3	The author created many diverse types of moods in this @CAPS10. At one point in the @CAPS1, he creates a sweet and endearing type of @CAPS6 by carefully describing his home, a place full of warmth and character, him @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and emphasizing how the kitchen was the heart of his house, a place where family and friends gathered. At another point in the @CAPS1, the author created a @CAPS5 @CAPS6. He creates this @CAPS6 by vividly telling the @CAPS7 about how his family took everybody in with open arms. His family always went out of their way to help their friends, and when family visited, they always had a comfortable place to @CAPS8. He also created a sad tone by talking about how he'll never be able to fully express his gratitude towards his parents, a feeling that tugs at the heartstrings. Finally, at the end of the @CAPS1, the author creates a sincere @CAPS6. He creates these sincere @CAPS6 by whole - heartedly expressing his gratitude towards his parents for being so selfless. These are the ways the @CAPS6 changes during his @CAPS10, adding depth and richness to the overall work.
731	12557	5	3	In the memoir of @PERSON1, the author vividly shows a lot of mood throughout the engaging story. Happy and grateful stand out as the two most prominent and important moods. @PERSON1 is deeply grateful throughout the memoir. He is extremely grateful for his friends and family, especially his caring and self - less parents. He appreciates all of the hard work they do and what they gave up back in Cuba in order to come to @LOCATION1. His dad worked diligently in the laboratory and his mom studied chemical engineering with great dedication. Lastly, he is truly grateful to have grown up in a really warm and loving home. Another mood is happiness. In the first paragraph, the parenthesis clearly indicates that he really enjoys cooking and Cuban music. He is also very proud about his Cuban heritage and how his extended family stays closely with him. This memoir has a rich array of mood in it and it makes the reading experience a lot better.
732	12558	5	3	The mood from the author in her Life was very good as she lived @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in a simple yet cozy house in Cuba. @CAPS1 used to do a lot of fun things with her family. She is grateful for her parents' love and sacrifice. She has often @CAPS1 told them that what they did was so very courageous. Her parents, in turn, told her at an early age that they demonstrated how important family and friends are. This upbringing in such an environment filled with love and values contributed to the positive mood of her life story.
733	12559	5	3	Narciso's mood in the @CAPS1 is centered around him growing up in Cuba and then moving to the US. When he is in the @CAPS2.S, he carefully finds a house. Later in the @CAPS1, he and his family lovingly make the house into a warm and inviting home. The @CAPS1 is also about explaining what his life is like, such as what he does like cooking delicious meals for his family and what he does in his free time, which gives a comprehensive view of his experiences.
734	12560	5	3	@PERSON1 is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the reading, Narciso created a very grateful and excited mood. One clear example of this was when he sincerely said that he was forever grateful for his family's Cuban cooking, which was full of love and tradition. Another example of this mood was when he was getting really excited over the fact that his whole immigrant neighborhood was lending out a helping hand even if you had a different @NUM1. He also portrayed greatfulness by how, even though he hasn't met his real grandparents, someone in the neighborhood supplanted them and treated @PERSON1 like a beloved grand - child. That is the warm and endearing mood that @PERSON1 showed in his memoir of his family.
735	12561	5	3	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The character is always sincerely complimenting his parents and is always telling them he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" A significant part of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and the culture. Narciso strongly adores his family, and this adoration is evident throughout the memoir, creating a heart - warming and positive mood that makes the story truly engaging."
736	12562	5	3	In the short story, @PERSON1, the author artfully shows a deep - seated mood of gratitude and appreciation for everything her parents have done throughout their long lives. Her parents have endured numerous tough moments, like financial hardships and health scares, yet they doggedly kept moving on. Their perseverance was aimed at making their own lives and their child's life not just easy but truly good. This unwavering effort from the parents is what the author is so grateful for.
737	12563	5	3	The author's mood is one of pure happiness. The author is genuinely overjoyed to undertake this @CAPS1 about a family that is deeply grateful for living in their country. This family loves their country with all their hearts, cherishing its culture, traditions, and the sense of community it provides. They will never forget their country, as it is the very foundation of their identity and the source of so many precious memories.
738	12564	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is, in my sincere opinion, pure happiness and love. Narciso Rodriguez poignantly says that ""Growing up in this warm - hearted environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This remarkable family showcases this idea many times in the memoir. They were always hospitable, frequently having people over. For instance, the landlord's daughter, Alegria, who was Narciso's first friend and a kind babysitter, went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also states that ""also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my'real' grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba.)"" @CAPS1 also regularly had many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went."" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family,"" which clearly explains why the house was brimming with happiness. However, I firmly think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" This loving atmosphere is what makes the memoir so special."
739	12565	5	3	I think the author's mood is a beautiful blend of being honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I believe the author's mood is partly one of honor because, in paragraph @NUM1, he vividly expressed how he deeply feels about his parents. His parents are so loving that they not only make their family members feel loved but also make everyone around them feel welcomed. I also think he was proud because, in paragraph @NUM2, he elaborately explains how much he appreciates his family and his parents. His parents have open arms and are always ready to help those in need. He is at a loss for words to express the commitment and kindness his parents show to everyone. Throughout the story, the author always mentions how loving his parents are, and one can clearly see in the passage that he has picked up that wonderful trait. The words and expressions he uses in the story to describe his parents' love for their family and their @CAPS1 are a testament to his own loving nature. These are the reasons I believe are behind his various moods.
740	12566	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is not just nice but also calming. It describes how the family whole - heartedly lets people into their house with open arms and an open door. This act of generosity makes me, and maybe other readers, perceive the mood as extremely nice. The mood is calm because the memoir talks about this family doing kind and gentle things. There is no yelling, no fighting; instead, there are acts of kindness, shared meals, and warm conversations. I find this peaceful and inclusive atmosphere to be both nice and calming, creating a heart - warming reading experience.
741	12567	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home, his mood undergoes a distinct change. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, he mentions rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that has persisted with him to this day (and for which he remains eternally grateful). He also talks about passionate Cuban music (which he still adores to this day). Whenever there are parentheses, it indicates that the mood of the story shifts when he discusses his life in Cuba and his new life here in America. He is truly grateful that he is in America and that his parents left Cuba, where they once had a seemingly better life. This gratitude is palpable throughout the memoir, showing how his experiences have shaped his outlook.
742	12568	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez has a warm, loving, and caring feel to it. Since he is talking about his family, it is only natural that he comes across as loving. For example, he says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends"". This clearly shows that he deeply misses those times. And because he misses them so much, it is evident that he cared a great deal about those moments. So, the mood created in the excerpt is a tender blend of love and care, which makes the reader feel connected to his emotions."
743	12569	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true to life. Throughout the memoir, the author repeatedly expresses how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir, Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents had to endure a great deal of hardship. They had to leave their native country, bid farewell to their friends and family, and essentially start their lives afresh. But despite these difficulties, his parents remained strong during those tough times. They cared for Narciso and taught him many important life lessons. The mood the author sets is one of deep - seated love. The author had truly incredible parents, and his gratitude for them is a central theme that makes the memoir heart - warming."
744	12570	5	3	"The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader about how deeply grateful @CAPS1 is for living in @LOCATION1. Even though @CAPS1 didn't reside in a big, luxurious house, it is her family that makes her cherish her house. @CAPS1 wholeheartedly loves and appreciates what her family has done for her. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 will never forget the house because it is where @CAPS1 discovered the real meaning of family. ""It is where I learned the real definition of 'family.'"" And for this reason, @CAPS1 will never forget that house, its kind - hearted neighborhood, or the numerous things learned there about how to love. This sense of gratitude and love permeates the memoir, making it a touching read."
745	12571	5	3	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just briefly describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He provides an in - depth and heart - warming description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the meaningful relationships he forged. He also spends some time elaborating on the selflessness of his parents and the efforts they made to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this unfamiliar place. The author sets a mood that makes people want to read this memoir if they are feeling down and simply desire to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this memoir gives off a sense of selflessness, but also of coming together when everyone is segregated and forming unity. When you transform segregation into unity, positive things are bound to occur. The author says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story truly shows that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place. If we follow their example, we can all live in harmony and unity."
746	12572	5	3	In the memoir, the young boy vividly talks about how his parents unreservedly gave up everything for him. They were incredibly self - less, even going so far as to invite refugees into their home. Despite there not being much room in their modest abode, they opened their doors, showing a remarkable spirit of kindness and generosity. This selflessness left a deep and lasting impression on the boy, which he has captured in his memoir.
747	12573	5	3	In this memoir, the author skillfully created a mood that truly depicts what it was like in his childhood home. Based on paragraph @NUM1, cooking was indeed a significant and integral part of the author's childhood life. The author describes a home that was completely filled with the enticing smell of the kitchen and the “passionate @CAPS1 music.” Evoking a warm mood that instantly makes you think of a cozy home, this paragraph serves as the foundation of the author's childhood memories. The author lived in a neighborhood predominantly populated by immigrants, who were friendly and always ready to help one another out. In paragraph @NUM2, the author describes a mood brimming with family, friendship, and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same in terms of background or culture, they accepted one another as equals during a time rife with racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremely difficult. It's hard to secure good jobs when you've just immigrated and perhaps don't have a large amount of money. It's also challenging to get used to the climate change and learn another language. This creates a mood of hardship and tough times. Throughout this memoir, the author effectively creates various moods, whether good or bad, that bring back the memories of his childhood.
748	12574	5	3	The mood created by the author is a truly happy one. It brings a strong sense of security with friends, families, and neighbors. His parents made great sacrifices; they sacrificed their careers and left behind friends and family, essentially starting their life over entirely for the benefit of their children. Where Narciso lived was a nice two - family blond brick building. There, she learned Cuban culture, such as the art of cooking and the lively music that filled the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of “families.” Not necessarily blood - related, their neighbors were mostly immigrants, and when all those different cultures came together, there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a close - knit community where a helping hand was always there if needed. Her parents always kept their arms and their door open, welcoming others in. Alegria, their landlord's daughter, came down to their kitchen more often than not. Also, her aunts Bertha and Juanita, along with her cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary, were frequent visitors. Often, someone would stay with them temporarily. Even in hard times, her parents would sacrifice anything for her. And for that, Narciso is truly grateful. She is grateful to her parents for transforming a simple house into a loving home.
749	12575	5	3	The mood created in this article is a truly joyful one. He says, “My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and for which I am eternally grateful.” This clearly shows that he is deeply grateful for what he received, and the mood is very much joyful. Also, he says, “Passionate Cuban music, which I adored this day, filled the air, mixing with the aroma of the kitchen.” Here, the innocence of childhood, the gathering of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in their warm home. It means that the mood is lightened up a little when he says all of this stuff, making the reader feel the happiness and contentment he experienced.
750	12576	5	3	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author masterfully created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly and enthusiastically tells us how much he still loves it today. “Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air...” (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of simply telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parentheses to remind us that he still holds a deep love for the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home, as it has become a cherished part of his life. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. “I've thanked them repeatedly.” (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and firmly proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful “will never forget...” something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfulness that resonates with the reader.
751	12577	5	3	The memoir is that @ORGANIZATION2 lived in Cuba and they eventually arrived at the @ORGANIZATION3. After some time, they finally could afford a @NUM1 - bedroom apartment where they had a baby in 1961, that's when Narciso Rodriguez was born. In @LOCATION1, in a blond - brick building with its thin walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. The very heart of this home was my kitchen. Both of my parents were excellent cooks. They truly love to cook with passion. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, gently mixing with the wonderful aromas of the kitchen, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.
752	12578	5	3	The mood of the @CAPS1 was quite good. He was talking about his family a great deal. One reason was that he deeply @CAPS2 his family, and second, their motivation was always to keep moving around the city, state, or wherever he might go. The @CAPS1 was never @CAPS4; instead, he was mostly happy, and his story was full of positive vibes. In the end, his positive attitude towards his family and their adventures made his tale quite engaging.
753	12579	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and gratefulness. Here are my three reasons why I think that. First of all, Narciso is extremely proud of the way @CAPS2 lives and who @CAPS2 is. It all began with his parents, who are immigrants. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house."" Above all, @CAPS2 cherished every single moment @CAPS2 lived. @CAPS2 is truly grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else. ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family"". Finally, His parents migrated from Cuba. They are known as immigrants because they were not born in America, and Narciso is genuinely proud and honestly happy for them. That's why I firmly believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and gratefulness."
754	12580	5	3	"In the memoir, there were actually two main moods. The first mood and the most prominent mood was joy and happiness. Throughout the memoir, the reader learns about the writer's family and how extremely grateful the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir. Even though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. It was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefore, sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyous mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a full sense of where the writer is coming from, the reader must consider both these moods carefully."
755	12581	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and grateful mood throughout the memoir. He did this by never promoting himself, but always sincerely thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped each other. For example, in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the great sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" By writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows deep appreciation towards them, which then gives the reader a strong sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a close - knit family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In this neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This description gave me a clear sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez successfully produced a mood of caringness and gratefulness throughout his memoir."
756	12582	5	3	"There are many moods that the author creates in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. Some moods it creates are sad, brave, and thankful. The author creates a sad mood in many ways. One way he creates a sad mood in the article is in paragraph @NUM1, where he poignantly talks about how immigrants leave their families, friends, and careers, just to come to @LOCATION1 to do good and to lead their children to a better place. In paragraph @NUM2, he also sincerely says he will always be grateful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your friends and families behind is indeed a brave action. He also creates a sad mood when he emphasizes that all immigrants selflessly come to this country to give their children a better life. The author is clearly showing that he understands how immigrants come to @LOCATION1. He further creates a sad mood by solely focusing on the sacrifices and never talking about the good things. Overall, these elements contribute to the multi - faceted mood in the story."
757	12583	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, the @CAPS3 carefully explains the definition of family as not just blood relatives but as people who leave a lasting imprint in your life because of the large impact they have on you and the significant role they play in your life, portraying a certain figure in your eyes. As the @CAPS3 descriptively goes through this, throughout the time @CAPS5 is talking about family and its definition, they are not portrayed as people related by blood but basically as those who are there for you, the ones who offer a shoulder to cry on. In the memoir, the landlord and his daughter often put food on the table for the @CAPS6. Moreover, the whole community had become a family because they acted as one, reaching out to lend a hand even though they came from very different backgrounds, some more different from each other. They stood unified, resulting in something more profound; they were truly a family. This shows that family can be formed in unique and meaningful ways.
758	12584	5	3	In Narciso Rodriguez from Home, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, the mood that was created by the author in the memoir is @CAPS3 but also sad because, as stated in @CAPS4 one, the boy's father and mother were living in a one - room apartment, which depicts a rather difficult living situation. However, it is @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 because his parents had him and they made the house feel like a warm home to him. They taught him how to cook and introduced him to different music from his culture, and he still adores that music today. This information was found in @CAPS4 @NUM1. The last thing that made this @CAPS7 @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 was that the neighbors lived together harmoniously and were there for each other when needed. Plus, they had different religions like Italian, Spanish, and Cuban. I got this statement from @CAPS4 @NUM2. That is why this @CAPS7 is @CAPS3 but also at the same time sad, presenting a complex and multi - toned mood.
759	12585	5	3	"The mood in this selection is proud and happy. I know this from some clear clues in the text. The first and most prominent clue is when the author states some heartfelt facts like ""and for which I am eternally 'grateful'"" and ""which I adore to this day"". These words clearly convey a sense of deep appreciation. Also, when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"", it vividly shows how proud she is of her parents' efforts. All these elements in the text contribute to the overall proud and happy mood."
760	12586	5	3	"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of deep gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is directed towards his parents for their cultural influence and selflessness in leaving their family and friends so that their kids could have a better life. One line that really powerfully showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). This line clearly shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He has a deep - seated love for his Cuban family with all their rich traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez consistently and effectively creates a mood of gratitude and love throughout his memoir, making the readers feel the warmth of his emotions."
761	12587	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of heartfelt happiness. Rodriguez sincerely explains how appreciative he is of his parents and every single thing they have done for him. They worked hard to transform his house into a warm and inviting home and were always there for him through thick and thin. He talks about friendships and families, emphasizing that family can also be the relationships between friends, even if they aren't blood relatives. Overall, he deeply thanked his parents and said, ""In reality, there is no way to express my profound gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the clear demonstration of how important family and friends truly are."" This shows the strong bond and the positive influence his family has had on his life."
762	12588	5	3	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez carefully creates a reflective and relaxed mood as he delves into his memories. For example, his strategic use of parentheses effectively creates a unique voice for him, through which the reader can more clearly understand what he is trying to convey. Also, by positively reflecting on old times, it vividly feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a truly pleasant and engaging conversation. For instance, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter at @LOCATION1, he fondly mentions how she would often grace his table with her charming presence. Furthermore, by meticulously describing the environment of his apartment, it strongly feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a comfortable wood - backed chair, listening to the sweet serenade of an unnamed Cuban singer. The rich smell of spices lingers gently in the air. The light smoke from a stove slightly waters the eyes as it drifts lazily out the window. The distinct sound of engines and the sharp beep of horns, created by the low roar of a bus, plays in the background. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture pleasantly catch the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is extremely important for the author to effectively get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez indeed does it remarkably well.
763	12589	5	3	The mood that the author has created in this memoir is a genuinely happy feeling because he is deeply proud of his culture. He whole - heartedly loves his parents and adores the house that they transformed into a warm and loving home. The author explains in detail how his life began in New Jersey and how incredibly proud of his parents he was. He looks up to them with great admiration and plans on sincerely carrying out the culture and traditions that his family had. That's exactly what makes me think that the mood that the author sets is one of happiness and a fullness of this family's life. As I read this passage, I was truly glad and happy for him that he so deeply admires his family and that his life was filled with such joy. This kind of family - centered happiness is truly heartwarming.
764	12590	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir could be a beautiful blend of happiness, profound gratefulness, and deep - seated love. The author vividly describes in the memoir how his parents bravely left their beloved country, Cuba, to give their children a better life. Even though it meant leaving behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and promising careers in the country they held so dear (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The author expresses his gratefulness clearly by stating that he is extremely grateful for his rich culture and the huge sacrifice his parents made (@CAPS1 @NUM2). To conclude, the author also openly expresses his feelings about the house he used to live in. Through his words, you learn the real and touching definition of ""family"". He is really overjoyed about the warm welcomes his parents used to extend when other refugees arrived in this country. At the end, the author tenderly says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). This shows the lasting impact of his parents' love and kindness."
765	12591	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was deeply sad because he grew up as a poor boy. His family had no money at all. He was living in a small @NUM1 - bedroom apartment in New Jersey. Their living space was centered around a tiny kitchen where his parents both shared the cooking duties. Despite their difficult situation, his parents still remembered the traditional way they acted in Cuba. They were living in a very poor house, which was a refugee place where all refugees lived. After he thought about going to school to help his family, he started his educational journey. He began to learn a lot of things about love and other important aspects of life. He also started learning @CAPS1 because he didn't know how to speak it before. He lived in a house where he celebrated his birthday, but it was extremely small, about the size of the kitchen. He said he will always be deeply grateful to his family for doing so many great things for him. This was when he was very young, and he was very proud of his parents. He told his parents that he admired them for their remarkable strength, courage, and perseverance. So, it was a very sad life for him and his parents, filled with hardships but also with the warmth of family love.
766	12592	5	3	I think that the mood of this excerpt is deeply caring. The parents wouldn't have, quite literally, given their lives away to start anew and give their children a better place to live. They had a perfectly comfortable and well - established life back at home, with all the familiarity and security it entailed, yet they selflessly gave it all away for their children. That is precisely why the mood of this excerpt is caring.
767	12593	5	3	The parents of Narciso are immigrants. They originally lived in Cuba. The parents managed to create a traditional Cuban home in a new place. It was extremely hard for the parents to leave Cuba. This is a great family that provides support. In this country, immigrants often have to adapt to living in a new place. But immigrants carry their own culture with them. If you are Cuban, you have your unique and rich culture, which helps maintain a sense of identity in a foreign land.
768	12594	5	3	"The mood of the poem is very warm and loving. The vivid and warm memories of his home, filled with the lively and passionate Cuban music that could make one's heart dance and the deep - seated love for culinary arts, leave the reader with a palpable sense of the warmth and love that permeated the house. The words he uses, like ""adore,"" ""warm home,""  ""innocence of childhood,"" ""passionate,"" ""congregation,"" ""love of cooking"" and ""celebrations"" allow the reader to be immersed in an excerpt full of loving and heartfelt mood. His discussion of the real definitions of family, which aren't only limited to blood relatives, leaves the reader feeling warm as the paragraph talks about his extended family like Alegria, Sergio and [name of another person]; and his real relatives like aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins. The statement ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" is so full of love that the mood is struck in a strong, final chord of warmth, which leaves the reader thoroughly satisfied. The mood of [PERSON1] is undoubtedly loving."
769	12595	5	3	The mood in this article is clearly happy and grateful. I think it's happy because Narciso vividly tells you about the great deal of fun he has with his parents and close family. He describes the enjoyable moments they share, which makes it evident that he relishes every bit of it. Also, Narciso expresses how much he likes living where he lives, with all the unique experiences and people around. I think it's grateful because Narciso was fortunate enough to get the education that he had always wanted. Everyone around him, be it family or friends, was so proud of his achievements. Overall, I feel like the mood is mostly a blend of happiness and gratitude.
770	12596	5	3	"Living life in a country or place far away can be extremely difficult, as I've learned from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation, making daily life a struggle, and there is also the occasional sting of racism and discrimination. Nonetheless, this well - told memoir tells of the contentment and the positive side of it all. It portrays the happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In this home, he still got to experience the rich Cuban culture, including the soulful music that could lift one's spirits, the delicious traditional cooking that filled the air with enticing aromas, and best of all, the wonderful ambiance of having family around. The quote ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir. It shows how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life, even though at times they were looked down upon. This memoir serves as a reminder that happiness can be found even in difficult circumstances."
771	12597	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family were bound by an intense, unwavering love that gave them the strength to overcome various struggles. They opened their home to others in need, allowing those who weren't biologically part of their family to become integral members. They genuinely loved and cared for these individuals, perhaps even more than themselves. They made the difficult decision to leave behind everything they had in Cuba and journey to America, driven by the hope of a better future for their children. This profound love transformed their ordinary house into a warm, loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home. It was a haven not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community and the extended ""family"" they created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and it was this love that the author so beautifully captured."
772	12598	5	3	The mood was happy because most of his family successfully immigrated to @LOCATION1. He, along with his parents, had a deep - seated love for cooking. He adored the rich, inviting smell that filled the kitchen whenever they prepared a meal. Their family often got together to cook, and friends would come to visit, enjoying the delicious food. However, the author's past was marred by unhappiness as they had to endure the harsh reality of racism. Despite this, the happy moments with family and cooking provided a counterbalance to those difficult times.
773	12599	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a blend of happiness and gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explicitly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clear expression of gratitude sets a tone of appreciation. In paragraph @NUM2, the author further elaborates on the courage of their parents, saying, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Given these heartfelt statements, it is evident that the author is filled with a deep - seated happiness and gratitude. This mood permeates the memoir, making it a touching tribute to the author's parents."
774	12600	5	3	The mood given by the author in this memoir is one of pure happiness. In the memoir, Narciso expresses his deep - seated gratitude for his parents' selfless act. They left the only place they truly loved, Cuba, with the sole purpose of providing a better life for their children in the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso is in awe of the love and sacrifice his parents have shown. For instance, he mentions that in Cuba, Narciso, SR., had a stable job in the laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering. But in the United States, they had to start from scratch, taking whatever work they could find. Narciso's love for his parents is palpable as he reflects on this sacrifice and the risks they took. This is the very reason he penned this memoir, to celebrate his parents' love and the happiness it has brought him.
775	12601	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood crafted by the author in the memoir is a complex mix of happiness and sadness. The author was meticulous in ensuring that the mood was in perfect harmony with the words in the story. The language used was a reflection of both happy and sad emotions. At the beginning of the story, a somber mood prevailed, perhaps due to the challenges and hardships described. However, as the narrative progressed, the mood gradually shifted to a more positive and happier one. This ebb and flow of mood added depth and authenticity to the memoir, making it a compelling read. Overall, this was the nuanced mood that the author skillfully created in the memoir."
776	12602	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was deeply centered around family. He vividly describes the atmosphere of his upbringing in New Jersey, sharing the daily life and experiences of that time. He talks about ""Sergio and Edelmira"", who were his grandparents. In fact, he did not see his real grandparents until 1970. Even though a lot of the people around him were not his real family by blood, he whole - heartedly considered them to be so because they genuinely cared for and loved him. That's what I firmly think the mood in the memoir is, a warm and family - oriented one."
777	12603	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir written by the author @PERSON1 is that he is an internationally recognized clothing designer, well - known across the globe. In this memoir, he offered his unique and heartfelt definition of ""family"". It is a truly heart - warming story that delves into his life and what he affectionately calls his one and only ""family"", showing the special bond and emotions within it."
778	12604	5	3	I think the mood created by the author was to clearly show everyone that Narciso is extremely grateful to live where he does. He has a deep love for his home, and his parents are an important part of this warm environment. Everyone in his family gets along harmoniously. Even though he is an immigrant, he has a strong desire to succeed and build good relationships with everyone around him. This positive attitude and sense of belonging truly define the mood of the story.
779	12605	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1, not much action takes place, so there isn't a distinct emotional feeling. About half - way through the @NUM2 paragraph, the memoir really starts to become very @CAPS1. It is truly @CAPS1 because you come to realize that he has the remarkable ability to transform a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It is stated in paragraph @NUM3 that their neighborhood was composed of ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those different cultures could coexist in a friendly neighborhood during those difficult times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1, when Narciso Rodriguez starts to sincerely thank his parents, it gives you the feeling as if you were inside that house, sharing a warm dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three - room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout its entirety, leaving a lasting impression."
780	12606	5	3	The mood of the author of the story is a complex blend of happiness and sadness. He is happy because he is incredibly grateful to have had parents like he did. Their love and support have been a constant source of comfort. At the same time, he is sad because not all of his childhood was filled with great moments. However, having a loving family made those difficult times bearable. It made his home a place full of warmth and where his family truly belonged, creating a bittersweet yet endearing mood in the story.
781	12607	5	3	"When I read ""Narciso Rodriguez"", I immediately thought the overall mood was warm and filled with deep - seated thought. The statement ""family had nothing to do with being blood related"" struck me as incredibly welcoming. It clearly showed that his parents had an open - hearted and inclusive attitude. They didn't care about your background, who you were, or what culture you adhered to. He was always full of gratitude towards his parents. They had made the difficult decision to leave Cuba so that their children could have access to a better life. His parents held the belief that if they endured the tough times, they would surely enjoy the good times that were yet to come. For this unwavering determination and selfless sacrifice, he always expressed his heartfelt thanks. In essence, his parents' actions and values were the foundation of the warm and thoughtful mood that permeated through the text."
782	12608	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very clearly one of happiness and deep appreciation for what he once had. I can easily tell this because every time the author speaks in the memoir, his tone is always upbeat and positive. Throughout the entire story, I noticed that not a single negative thing was mentioned. An excellent example of his appreciation for his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" One can clearly tell he was happy because he'll always cherish how kind and giving his parents were. Another instance highlighting the happy mood is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement shows just how happy he was due to the immense love his parents showered on him. My third example from the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This reveals that the writer highly values how much his parents cared for others, and how reciprocal the care was. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4, where it states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement powerfully shows how happy and appreciative the author is, as his parents made such a huge sacrifice to give their kids a great life. In conclusion, these four specific examples vividly illustrate how the mood created by the author was one of great happiness and appreciation in the memoir."
783	12609	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez From, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by the author is entirely centered around love and happiness. The memoir mainly delves into family and childhood memories. It effectively expresses the author's feelings of love, and as a result, the reader can truly feel it too. The author didn't possess many material possessions growing up, nor did they live in a big house. However, there were an abundance of wonderful memories filled with love and warmth. The numerous different memories in this memoir collectively give rise to a mood of love and happiness. First of all, it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author lived in a neighborhood teeming with many different cultures. Despite their diverse backgrounds, they were able to set aside their differences and form great friendships. Also, the memoir mentions in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This clearly shows that their family was extremely inviting. They were constantly having guests over, and they loved a large number of people and regarded them as family. The author also states in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Evidently, the author didn't have a large home, but it's the memories and the warm environment his parents created that he truly holds dear. In conclusion, from reading this memoir, one can genuinely feel the loving mood, from all of the author's amazing childhood memories to his wonderful home environment.

The author has masterfully crafted a mood that conveys to the reader that he has no regrets about his childhood. He is deeply grateful for his wonderful and caring parents, who have been a constant source of love and support. The author also creates a mood that makes it clear he is proud of his Cuban heritage. He values everything and everyone that he has grown up around, seeing them as integral parts of his identity. Narciso has also managed to instill a mood of strong emotions towards his beloved parents, friends, and family. The relationships he shares with them are clearly of great importance to him. The mood of this memoir is not just positive; it can be described with rich and profound meaning, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
785	12611	5	3	"The author's mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, can be accurately described as calm and tinged with a bit of sadness. The author is constantly reminiscing about what her home was like during her childhood. She vividly recalls the familiar sights, sounds, and feelings associated with that place. However, now she is on the verge of moving away from her beloved home. This impending departure makes her heart heavy with sadness. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This statement adds to the sense of sadness. It's possible that her parents have passed away, and these are the precious memories she holds dear about them. As you can see, the author's tone in this memoir remains calm, yet it is deeply infused with a melancholy sadness, making the reader empathize with her emotional state."
786	12612	5	3	"In the memoir written by @PERSON1, the author artfully created a mood that beautifully shines throughout the entire story. This mood vividly represents the happiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in that cozy three - room apartment in Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author details how his parents, with pride in their Cuban heritage, brought the essence of Cuba to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always truly grateful that his whole house revolved around the kitchen. There was always the lively Cuban music playing and the enticing smell of a Cuban fiesta filling the air. @PERSON1 was constantly happy because he was always an integral part of a loving family. Throughout the tough times that @PERSON1's parents endured, there was never a shortage of love or the warm feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When the author utters this, it creates a heart - warming happy mood that flows seamlessly throughout the memoir. Also in paragraph seven, he states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir clearly shows that the importance of family and friends creates a positive and lasting feeling in anyone's life, making it a cherished experience."
787	12613	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a profound sense of happiness and love for family. He writes about how his parents and other immigrants made the brave decision to move to @CAPS1.S.A solely for the purpose of providing a better life for their children. He conveys this in a way that makes the reader feel as if he is overflowing with extreme happiness. He also elaborates on how his parents patiently taught him to cook and engagingly talked to him about Cuban culture. He was extremely proud and deeply grateful to his parents for imparting all these valuable lessons. The author describes how this small, simple home was an incredibly special place to him and explains in detail what it truly meant to him. This house became so special to him not only because he spent his childhood there but also because he received unconditional love from his parents within its walls. This was the very house where he was able to truly understand what the word ""family"" really signified and how it filled him with such happiness that he knew he would never in his life be able to forget his family. These feelings of love and happiness were the dominant moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
788	12614	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood the author sets is a thankful and soft one. The author is thanking his parents in a genuinely good way, in a kind, gentle, and highly appreciative manner. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) that always fills the air with not just a wonderful scent and lively music but also life and love (pg. @NUM1). All you need in life is a little bit of imagination and a great deal of help and love. This person in the memoir received a lot of help and love, and he describes it in a nice, calm way, sincerely thanking his parents for all that they have selflessly done for him. This thankful mood pervades the entire memoir, making it a touching tribute to his parents."
789	12615	5	3	"The mood that is created by the author is a pure sense of joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parents are hard - working immigrants. They could have easily stayed in their own country, enjoying the familiarity and comfort of their homeland. However, they selflessly chose to leave everything behind and move to a new place because they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso finally realized the magnitude of his parents' sacrifice, he felt an overwhelming sense of happiness and was filled with pure joy. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're truly grateful, you naturally feel a deep sense of happiness. This is the mood that I firmly believe this author successfully created in the memoir, leaving the reader with a warm and happy feeling."
790	12616	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a deep - seated love and unbridled happiness. In the memoir, the reader can clearly sense the author's profound love and sincere gratitude towards his parents. Not only did his parents love him unconditionally, but they also made the huge sacrifice of quitting their jobs and moving across the world. They did this just so they could offer their son a much better life. The author's parents risked so much for their son, showing their unwavering commitment and selflessness. The author clearly states that he is extremely grateful for his parents and emphasizes that there is no possible way to fully express the love he feels for them. This memoir powerfully expresses the love and gratitude within one's family, demonstrating how a little bit of genuine caring can have a far - reaching and long - lasting impact. It serves as a beautiful reminder of the importance of family love and sacrifice.
791	12617	5	3	The mood of this story is quite peculiar and very weird. This story beautifully depicts different cultures coming together as one harmonious entity. Narciso's parents are extremely nice and incredibly generous. They are always on the lookout for those who need a home, taking them in and treating them just like family members. Narciso still has some of his family remaining in Cuba, and he might be able to meet them at a later time in his life. Anyways, the mood of this story is truly heart - warming. Narciso was also very thankful for everything he has. Narciso's parents have a large number of people to feed since there is more than one family living in their home, so it is quite hard for them. Well, I firmly think the mood of the story is great, as it showcases the power of kindness and unity.
792	12618	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is a palpable sense of happiness. First, Narciso's parents endured the arduous struggle of coming to the United States and starting their lives over from scratch. Narciso narrates, ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" His parents made the long - journey from Cuba to the United States with the hope of having a happier and more prosperous future. Narciso's family is extremely kind to everyone, and in return, everyone in their neighborhood is equally nice to them. He explains his parents' doings. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents are genuinely happy to let anyone into their home and offer them a place of comfort. Finally, Narciso is deeply grateful towards his parents. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is very happy about what his parents did for him, and this happiness permeates the entire memoir. The mood of this memoir is indeed one of pure happiness."
793	12619	5	3	"One of the prominent moods in the memoir was a profound sense of gratefulness. Narciso is extremely grateful to have parents who gave up so many things to build a good life for him. Also, he is grateful because his parents showed him how incredibly important family and friends are. This means that he was truly thankful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for the people they loved. Another mood is a peaceful one because Narciso adored the Cuban music they listened to. Narciso had people over at his place all the time, and the kitchen was constantly being used. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" I mean his house was a peaceful and a safe haven. Everyone was always at his house. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" The last mood I thought was one of happiness. Narciso was always happy because his family helped so many people. Also, he loved that his parents taught them so many valuable things. I mean that he always had something meaningful to do. He was always overjoyed to be around family and friends, and this happiness is clearly felt throughout the memoir."
794	12620	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a beautiful blend of happiness and gratitude. The mood was crafted from the carefully chosen words and the way the author described his home and his deep appreciation of what his parents did for him. Narciso was born into a simple house in a blonde - brick building situated in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. The author said, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" Narciso explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" The author also explained how everyone in the community helped each other and treated each other like family. Even though his parents had no prior knowledge of the language or culture, they immigrated to make a better life for their children. They left everything behind them, struggling both financially and personally. Narciso was eternally grateful for what they did. In conclusion, the mood created by the author was one of the happiness of love and gratitude. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love,"" and these words perfectly encapsulate the overall mood of the memoir."
795	12621	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the protagonist in the memoir would be a little bit sad. The sadness stems from the fact that Narciso is talking about her life and how she grew up in a simple one - room house in 1961. Her mother didn't want her to live anywhere else. Narciso was an only child, and this memoir tells you mostly about her life experiences, challenges, and joys. That is the essence of the story in the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez.
796	12622	5	3	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a genuinely happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir, the author didn't mention even one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1, the author vividly talks about how his parents patiently taught him how to cook delicious Cuban dishes and how they instilled in him a deep - seated love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2, the author describes the strong unity and warm friendship that prevailed throughout his neighborhood, despite the obvious racial differences. The author fondly talks about all his friends and family members who often graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love unconditionally in paragraph @NUM4. As you can clearly see, there are no sad memories in this memoir, and I firmly believe that is what gives it such a heart - warming happy mood.
797	12623	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir was very grateful because of @PERSON1's family, who made great sacrifices as they nearly gave up everything in their homeland to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was truly grateful for the valuable talents his parents passed on to him, such as the art of cooking mouth - watering meals, and he deeply loved the rich heritage they had, like their intense interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been extremely grateful to be constantly surrounded by so many loving people. He mentions ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"", which shows the close - knit and loving community he was a part of. All these elements combined make it evident that gratitude permeates the memoir."
798	12624	5	3	"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happiness and @CAPS1. When the author restates when the girl sincerely says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", it clearly shows how much @CAPS2 deeply cares about her mother and father and how respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Another example that shows her mother and father's @CAPS3 and their deep care is when her mother and father had the immense courage to come to this country, without any prior knowledge of the language or the culture. They did this all for their daughter, and that line powerfully proves how much the mom and dad care about their daughter. Overall, the mood of the excerpt is a blend of happiness and @CAPS1 due to the strong family bond."
799	12625	5	3	The mood created by the author was very interesting. At some points, the author was extremely serious. He would in - depthly tell about the hard times his family had faced and what difficult situations they went through, like financial struggles and cultural adjustments. Then, he would suddenly switch to a joyous tone. He would vividly explain what his house would be like, filled with laughter and warmth. He would tell how joyous his house was and how he deeply loves his parents so much. He would passionately explain what loving and kind - hearted parents he had. He also showed how his family wasn't blood - related at all. His family was a beautiful combination of different cultures all coming together to make one happy and harmonious family. This unique blend of serious and joyous moments creates an interesting mood.
800	12626	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a profound sense of gratitude and pure happiness. Narciso repeatedly and emphatically states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it truly means to be a family, with values of selflessness and caring. He says, ""In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" When he is recollecting memories from his childhood, he paints a vivid picture of the happiness that filled their home. He says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" With his memoir, Narciso masterfully creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a strong sense of a cherished childhood, leaving the readers with a heart full of positive emotions."
801	12627	5	3	"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly centered around how the strong bonds between him and his parents, as well as everyone around them, enabled them to endure tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, he vividly states that in their neighborhood, ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" He further elaborates on how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author emphasizes that in his community, many different cultures united and supported each other through racism and other difficult situations. He firmly believes that ""family"" isn't just those related by blood, but those who hold a special place close to your heart, and these relationships provided a source of strength and comfort."
802	12628	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of pure happiness. Narciso fondly remembers all the wonderful times he had in his house. His parents are extremely friendly and welcoming, treating everyone they meet like family. In paragraph @NUM1, it poignantly says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This act of bravery and the sense of community they built is what true happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a positive and warm - hearted attitude, and they genuinely just want to be friends with everyone, spreading joy wherever they go."
803	12629	5	3	The mood of the story varies throughout the memoir. During the parts where he talks about the arduous struggles to get from Cuba to @LOCATION1, the mood is extremely sad and depressing. One can almost feel the despair and hardship they faced during that journey. However, the mood completely changes when he describes how his family sometimes gets together for dinner or when they throw a Cuban party for the relatives who arrived in @LOCATION1 from Cuba. These moments are filled with joy, celebration, and a sense of togetherness, highlighting the contrast in the overall mood of the memoir.
804	12630	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives,"" I believe the author Narciso Rodriguez articulately demonstrated the mood of being laid - back. This memoir doesn't sound very formal, primarily because Narciso adds little personal touches. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he inserts parentheses with additional statements. He also talks about his friends and family so openly, as if having a casual conversation. That's why I think @PERSON1's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives"" effectively conveys the mood of being laid back, making it an engaging and relatable read."
805	12631	5	3	There are numerous instances in the memoir when the author creates a distinct mood. One such time is when he meticulously describes a traditional Cuban home. In this description, he highlights that the kitchen is the heart of the home, and the combination of Cuban music and the enticing aromas wafting from the kitchen gives off a mood of intense hunger for great food. Another occasion when the author creates a mood is when he portrays how he lived in a close - knit community. This portrayal shows how he grew up in an environment where helping others was the norm, and in return, he was also helped. This gives the mood of a strong desire to help someone in need. A third time the author creates a mood is when he depicts his parents as caring individuals. His family always went out of their way to assist those considered family to them. This creates a mood of hope because his family knew that other people would reciprocate the kindness. Clearly, there are many times when the author effectively creates a mood for the reader, enhancing the overall reading experience.
806	12632	5	3	"In this memoir, the mood crafted by the author was genuinely heartwarming and filled with appreciation. There were numerous parts of this story that evoked such a warm feeling in me, making me instinctively want to say ""aw"". For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not necessarily of their own kind, who were clearly in need"". This line vividly showed me the abundance of love that must have existed within that community. It also highlighted how everyone truly cared about one another. When the author describes how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can clearly sense the depth of her gratitude. This is extremely evident in paragraph @NUM2, where it states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This story made me realize that we should always appreciate what others do for us. The author's profound gratitude for her parents shines through very clearly in this memoir, reminding us all of the importance of cherishing the sacrifices of our loved ones."
807	12633	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is extremely gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the huge risk his parents took when they left everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so that he could have a better life. Narciso vividly recalls how his parents had to take on any job they could find just to make ends meet. He quotes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This past @DATE1, I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, and I had to stay with a particular family. This family was incredibly kind to me; they went out of their way to give me whatever I needed. Their selfless and generous attitudes left a deep impression on me, and I will never forget them. When I read this passage, this family immediately popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels that most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will always hold his parents dear in his heart and will never forget the sacrifice they made for him, as it is a constant reminder of the power of parental love."
808	12634	5	3	The mood in the memoir is that Narciso deeply appreciates what his parents have done for him. They made the difficult decision to leave their homeland so that he could have a better life. He also appreciates that they transformed their simple house into a warm and loving home. He believes that what they did was incredibly courageous. Narciso is sincerely thanking his parents for sacrificing their life in Cuba to improve his. Their selfless act has had a profound impact on his life, and he will always be in debt to them for the opportunities and love they have provided.
809	12635	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez From Home: ""The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the little girl lives in a cramped one - bedroom apartment. She doesn't consider it a true home until she moves into a three - bedroom apartment. Only then, perhaps, will she call it home. Initially, she doesn't really understand love and how to care about people. But as the story progresses, at the end, she has a new understanding of love. She says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This transformation from not knowing about love to truly appreciating it shows the power of a loving family environment and how it can shape one's perception of home and love."
810	12636	5	3	When reading this memoir, it evokes a distinct feeling within you. The feeling is a sort of deep - seated sorrow. When this sorrow washes over you, it makes you wonder why the people in the story had to live such a difficult life. It also makes you realize that you should care for those who deal with such a challenging lifestyle. @CAPS1, for goodness sake, be kind to people. Don't be nasty because what you do can have a boomerang effect and affect you too. Treating others with kindness and empathy can make the world a better place, and this memoir serves as a poignant reminder of that.
811	12637	5	3	"The mood given by the author in the memoir is sweet, loving, and grateful. The author uses many kind, warm - hearted, and gracious words to vividly describe his family and carefully selects things from what we commonly picture as an ideal family to create an even more colorful and detailed image for us to visualize. He skillfully employs imagery and rich sensory language; this helps us truly feel a cozy, homey atmosphere when we read. In the neighborhood he lived in, ""... all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship,"" and this clearly shows how close everyone was to one another and how the diverse and rich cultures had seamlessly come together. In paragraph @NUM3, the author sincerely explains how grateful he is to his parents, who taught him valuable lessons that became the very root of his life. As most children experience through their lives, they are greatly influenced by their parents. To have his parents' teachings be the basis of his life, he must have had a deep - seated and profound connection with them. As he talks about his home and that his... ""parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed..."" them on to him, it shows how observant he is and how caring his parents are to have dedicated the time. These words effectively create a very sweet, loving, and gracious mood throughout the memoir."
812	12638	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyous and grateful. The author is joyous because in stanza two, Narciso vividly states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" This clearly shows that the childhood of this person was full of joy, with the vibrant culture, loving family, dear friends, delicious foods, and pleasant smells all contributing to the happiness. This person is very grateful for all the things his parents did. Such as when the author earnestly states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their deep - seated love and great sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the clear demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This shows that the author is truly and deeply grateful for everything the parents had done for him or her. Thinking back on those times now, the author is really filled with joy, which makes the mood of the memoir both joyous and grateful."
813	12639	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of happiness and being thankful. In the memoir, in paragraph @NUM1, when he is saying ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood - related because it only matters if you have sincere love for one another and you genuinely care about one another."" Narciso is clearly stating that he is proud of what he has become today. He loves and respects his unique culture deeply, and he is happy to have people to love and people who love him back. This overall sentiment effectively creates a mood of happiness and thankfulness in the memoir."
814	12640	5	3	"The @CAPS1 is trying to set a mood. The mood is inviting and shows how a family can overcome difficulties together. ""Parents warmly welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country."" This simple yet powerful act is a clear indication of how open - hearted and caring the family is. It portrays a sense of unity and support, suggesting that in the face of challenges, the family extends a helping hand to those in need. This kind of behavior not only sets an inviting mood but also emphasizes the strength that comes from a family coming together to overcome difficulties."
815	12641	5	3	The mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood. Everything is happy when they talk about his parents warmly welcoming the other immigrants into their home, which shows a spirit of kindness and unity. And how their landlord's daughter was his first friend, bringing a sense of childhood innocence and friendship. And then it talks about how their neighborhood is filled with @CAPS1, Spanish, and Italian immigrants, and how they are in that neighborhood because of racism. This sad reality of racism taints the otherwise happy aspects, creating an unhappy undertone. Overall, the combination of these happy and unhappy elements results in a complex and mixed mood within the memoir.
816	12642	5	3	The mood created by the author was a delightful blend of happiness, thoughtfulness, and extreme politeness. Narciso engaged in a warm conversation, vividly talking about his family and the details of his life. He also passionately expressed how deeply he loved his family and shared what he excelled at, like skillfully cooking delicious meals and playing his beloved Cuban music. This sharing created an inviting and pleasant atmosphere.
817	12643	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is truly joyous. The author vividly tells us how he whole - heartedly loves his Cuban culture. They actively listen to the vibrant music, skillfully cook traditional Cuban food, and it all creates a very cozy and house - warming environment. The author also has a deep love for his family. He never argues with them and they wholeheartedly enjoy every moment they have together. I think the author is overflowing with joy because of all the happiness that continuously surrounds him at his house, making the memoir a celebration of family and culture.
818	12644	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir. The humility clearly shows when he carefully describes how, although the interior of his house was rich and inviting, it was simple and ""modest"" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was snugly crammed into a three - room apartment. The sense of caring was prominently demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez affectionately referred to not just his blood - relatives, but also the friends and neighbors whom he sincerely considered ""family."" Of his parents, he tenderly says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community. Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph. He earnestly states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and strong sense of community. These three themes effectively set the warm and endearing mood of this memoir."
819	12645	5	3	The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a truly pleasant life. When the author explained how extremely grateful he was to have learned all the important things he had from his family, it portrayed a simple yet very enjoyable mood. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was transformed into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was warmly welcomed and treated as if they were close family members. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming, just as the Rodriguez's home was, making it a heart - warming read.
820	12646	5	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he develops a very warm, comforting, and happy mood of where he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents first came to the states and after spending some time living in a small, one - room apartment, they were finally able to move into a three - room apartment where he was born. He vividly speaks of how his home was decorated in the traditional Cuban style, about the lively Cuban music that was always playing in the background, and of how his parents patiently taught him to cook. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighborhood but of how they all came together in perfect unity. Everyone genuinely cared for one another and they readily helped whoever was in need. If someone needed help, they quickly received it and people were even willing to sacrifice for others. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up surrounded by the love of his family, making it a beautiful recollection of a happy childhood.
821	12647	5	3	"The mood created by the author is loving because it vividly depicts how generous and caring his family is. For instance, ""... @LOCATION1 graced our kitchen table for meals..."" This quote clearly gives you a strong idea of how close everybody in the family is. Moreover, the statement ""...family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" shows the inclusive nature of their family concept. In @CAPS1, people around Narciso treat him like family. He truly learned what family really meant by living in this warm - hearted house during his childhood. As he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir, one can clearly see how deeply Narciso loves his family and friends. Overall, the main mood of this memoir is undeniably loving, which makes the readers feel the warmth and kindness within the pages."
822	12648	5	3	The author creates a simple but peaceful and happy mood with the way he meticulously describes things. In paragraph @NUM1, he describes his home growing up in great @CAPS1 detail that makes it feel almost like you are physically there, experiencing the same environment. Also, the words he used to describe the neighborhood, like hard - working and close - knit, effectively help set the mood for the story. These descriptions make you reminisce about your own family and the sense of community you might have. In the end, the author's descriptive style successfully creates a mood that is both relatable and heart - warming.
823	12649	5	3	"Home is where the heart is, and many have said this and truly meant it. In the non - fictional memoir by @PERSON1, the author talks about the profound importance of family. Narciso weaves many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM1) This quote gives a strong sense that for him, home was the safest and happiest place to be, a haven filled with joy and togetherness. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (paragraph @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very caring place, where anyone they loved was whole - heartedly cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraph @NUM3). This sets the mood that he was never really alone; he always had people around him who cared and loved for him as he loved for them. ""My parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraph @NUM3). Through these descriptions, the memoir effectively conveys the deep - seated value of family and the warmth of home."
824	12650	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author is something that not a lot of people have the privilege to experience. In the selection, Narciso shows that he is truly thankful for being Cuban and living in the United States. His parents moved to Newark, New Jersey after living in Cuba with the noble intention of giving their children a better life. Narciso has ""a love of cooking"" because he was raised in an environment where his parents both cooked and had excellent culinary skills. He was also passionate about Cuban music which ""filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"", creating a rich and vibrant atmosphere. To Narciso, growing up in his environment, family had nothing to do with blood relation; it was more about someone you whole - heartedly think of as being like family. For Narciso, there was no way to fully show the gratitude and generosity he received at such an early age. He learned that family and friends are of utmost importance, which is a valuable lesson that enriches the mood of the story."
825	12651	5	3	"The mood created by the author was truly great. He skillfully made it so that Narciso was very happy and proud to have grown up in Cuba. He also crafted a narrative where Narciso was deeply grateful for everything he had. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quote not only shows Narciso's gratitude but also the positive influence his parents had on him. The mood created by the author was a great mood that made the readers feel the happiness and appreciation that Narciso experienced in his life."
826	12652	5	3	The mood is very loving and happy. The way he fondly talks about the neighborhood he grew up in, describing how everyone was so close - neighbors would often gather in the evenings to chat and share stories. Then, how he elaborately talked about how caring and unselfish his parents were, always going out of their way to help others. Just how grateful he is, with a deep - seated appreciation shining through his words, made the memoir very happy. This overall atmosphere of love and gratitude truly makes the memoir a heart - warming read.
827	12653	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. He is deeply grateful that his parents selflessly gave up everything that they had, such as their comfortable homes and familiar surroundings, just to give him a better life. In the memoir it says: ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved."" He is happy because he has been given a precious opportunity to have a better life and that he learned the real definition of family, which is about sacrifice, love, and togetherness. In conclusion, the mood for this memoir is one of pure happiness and heartfelt gratitude, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
828	12654	5	3	"The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the beginning and end, Narciso tenderly talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in that sentence you can clearly see that both Narciso's mother and father would always warmly welcome people into their house, making them feel at home with a kind smile and a cup of hot coffee. This loving attitude of his parents is what infuses the memoir with a strong sense of love."
829	12655	5	3	"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, The atmosphere created by the author in the memoir was a very soft atmosphere because they are all grateful for what has been going on with their lives. Like the author said in paragraph @NUM1 ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (Albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house, the gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home, a place full of memories and affection."
830	12656	5	3	"In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefulness. I know this because in the memoir it says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my deep - seated gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This clear evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was truly grateful, which is the mood of the memoir. His parents taught him how to love his culture, instilling in him a sense of pride and belonging (and for which I am eternally grateful). The way the author carefully puts the words and uses them, with a sincere and appreciative tone, shows the mood of the memoir is one of profound gratitude, making the readers feel the same warmth and thankfulness."
831	12657	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's @CAPS1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a very optimistic mood. Narciso vividly describes how, even though ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"", he and his ""family"" (which included foreign neighbors) still managed to overcome adversity with determination. In addition, he details how even though his neighborhood was filled with people from different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a close - knit family, sharing joys and sorrows. Lastly, he fondly describes all the memories and celebrations, like birthdays and festivals, that helped shape his house from a mere living space into a place of deep - seated love and friendship. It is really easy to tell that Narciso loved his family and friends all the same in a way that profoundly shaped his life, leaving an indelible mark on his character."
832	12658	5	3	I was in this simple house where my parents warmly welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country, and it was also the place where I celebrated my first birthday. I was in the cozy warmth of the kitchen in this humble house, where a Cuban feast always filled the air with a rich scent and an abundance of love. The aroma of spices and freshly cooked food wafted through every corner. It was here where I learned the real, profound definition of family, a bond that goes beyond blood. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there, like how to love unconditionally. I will always cherish the memories of that special place.
833	12659	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a well - known clothing designer who grew up in @LOCATION1 surrounded by all different immigrants. The diverse community was a melting pot of cultures and ideas. The mood of it is that home isn't just a physical space but the relationships we build. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1). He had a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who supported and cared for each other. I think Narciso might not have become the clothing designer he is if he didn't grow up with these people, as they influenced his perspective and creativity."

Also, he deeply admired their strength and perseverance. In the text it says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance..."" @CAPS1, he says that he will never forget how his parents, with their love and hard work, turned a simple house into a warm and loving home. That is the heartfelt mood the author creates in the memoir, a mood that resonates with the power of parental love and sacrifice."
835	12661	5	3	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir was regular because in the story (Narciso Rodriguez) he gently explains his life a little to the reader. He tells how they lived in Cuba and then moved to America. The boy also elaborately explains how he loves his home, the celebrations, and his heritage in America. The boy talks with a calm and steady tone because he's really just sharing his life story, not focusing on the present moment. There's no anger in this story; instead, it's filled with a sense of nostalgia and contentment as he reflects on his journey.
836	12662	5	3	In this article, the author exudes a mood that is both happy and proud. He has a deep - seated love for his place of origin.

It serves as a reminder that being present in a particular place can bring so much happiness and appreciation.
839	12665	5	3	"@PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home. His parents passed on to him their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which he is eternally grateful). Narciso is extremely happy that he learned such great cooking techniques during his childhood. As he mentions, ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). This happy atmosphere made his home in @CAPS1 a truly warm and inviting place. He also states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM2). Narciso managed to sum up his entire article in one sentence, capturing what most people feel when they are at home. At his home, he experiences everything he describes, because it's not about the physical location but about how one lives and the love that fills the space."
840	12666	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is calm and they are genuinely happy. I think this because they mainly talk about the wonderful things in their childhood, like the fun times and the valuable lessons learned. They also express how much they loved their family, which is a crucial aspect of a happy childhood. If a child doesn't have love or a close - knit family, it's difficult to be happy, but they clearly were. My last reason is that they were most grateful for their home and how their parents transformed a simple house into a loving home, filled with warmth and memories. This is why I firmly believe that the author's mood is happy and calm, and it makes the memoir a heart - warming read."
841	12667	5	3	I think the mood is happiness because when she was talking about her cooking skills and how she was listening to Cuban music in parentheses, it said stuff like “which I still love today.” When she said “our house became a home,” I think that meant that they are happily settled in, there's not a lot of stress, and everyone seems comfortable. She kept saying how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house. It just made me think she has to be really happy with her family, her house, and her life. She must be happy with her life here in @LOCATION1, as all these elements contribute to a content and joyful existence.
842	12668	5	3	The mood of this memoir is positive and caring. The reason why this story is caring is because they whole - heartedly take care of all the people staying there and they aid them until those people could move on with their lives. And the reason why this story is positive is because the parents are always having fun cooking cause that's their favorite thing to do, and they're always having fun together. These are the moods that are present in this memoir, creating a heart - warming and uplifting reading experience.
843	12669	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a happy reflective memoir on the family life of the author growing up.

The author talks about her family's love for cooking and the happy mood of the house with the ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". The author also talks about the close - knit community of honest hard - working migrants who lived in the surrounding homes. They were all friends that took care of each other, knowing that anyone would do the same for them as well.

This shows the emotions the author felt growing up, highlighting the deep appreciation and contentment that defined his childhood."
845	12671	5	3	"The mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents. First, the author talks about how his parents give up whatever they had for them. It says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially..."" This means that their parents gave up their family and friends and jobs in their beloved country, Cuba, just for him and his sister. So he appreciates them a lot for doing all of these for them, understanding the great sacrifice they made. Secondly, his parents showed him two lessons about life. The story states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them the admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" This shows that his parents taught him something important without telling him directly, but by showing him through their actions. Third, he learned the real definition of family. It says ""It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" It shows he learned the most important lesson in this house. These are the mood and how it is shown, revealing a deep - seated appreciation that enriches the overall tone of the memoir."
846	12672	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, content mood. This mood is vividly crafted as Narciso fondly talks about the truly great and joy - filled life his parents built for him. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he says “the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.” It just sounds so blissfully happy and full of love to me. He also shares things like “It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.” That’s another prime example of the loving, happy mood in this memoir because he's talking about how people were so genuinely helpful and gracious to anyone in need, and it makes me feel so heartened that people are like that. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about people's love toward each other, which set a very happy, light - hearted mood for me, leaving a warm and lasting impression.
847	12673	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is profound gratitude. First, Narciso deeply loved his parents and was extremely grateful for every single thing they did. Rodriguez sincerely says, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice” (@NUM1). Narciso's parents made the huge decision to come to the US just for him, and he is so appreciatively grateful. Secondly, he says he has tried to thank them so many times but simply doesn't know how. Rodriguez expresses, “There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me” (@NUM1). He is so overwhelmingly thankful that he doesn't even know how to put it into words. Even though they only had a three - room apartment, Narciso knows it was truly special. Narciso states with emotion, “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home” (@NUM3). His parents couldn't give him much because they didn't have much money, but it meant the entire world to him. Clearly, the mood of this passage is a powerful and heartfelt gratitude that resonates throughout.
848	12674	5	3	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart - lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to completely start their lives all over again, taking on any jobs they could find. They simply wouldn't have made it without the glimmer of hope that kept them going. They had unwavering hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1, believing they would have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart - lifting because it's about how their parents made the journey to @LOCATION1 for their kids, and those kids ended up successful in life and became someone significant. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always being ready to welcome more who had fallen down in their lives and needed some comfort shows as much care as a parent has for their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family and friends truly are and taught him to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful to his parents for these important lessons of life. They didn't just tell him; they showed him through their own lives, which makes it much more impactful. Their home always had a vibrant life because of the beautiful music and enticing aromas in the air, and all of the people who came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had immense courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the deep - seated message of the memoir, which is a celebration of hope, love, and courage.
849	12675	5	3	The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always in high spirits in the house, where there was always the inviting smell of delicious food and his parents' loving cooking. There was also always a strong and palpable sense of family in the house. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso said that “growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.” What he is clearly saying is that you don't have to be related by blood to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered a part of the family. He also felt that you should always lend a hand to people in need. That is what his parents did; they always helped people when they were in need and were always willing to share everything they had. This selfless and loving attitude is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love, creating a warm and inclusive atmosphere.
850	12676	5	3	I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it clearly states “I've thanked them repeatedly.” I believe this means that @CAPS2 is truly thankful that her parents provided him/her with a really good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 is that in the story the @CAPS3 says, “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” I think this means that the @CAPS3 is deeply appreciative, and that is the mood I believe the article is centered around, a mood that lingers and makes the reader feel the same sense of gratitude.
851	12677	5	3	The mood given by the @CAPS1 (In my perspective) is happy because even if you had to move to @LOCATION1, far away from his loved ones, he still managed to find happiness with his family in @LOCATION1. This shows that family bonds can overcome the distance and bring about a positive mood.
852	12678	5	3	The mood that was created @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 is a happy, loving mood. The reason I say this is @CAPS3 if you carefully read the passage, you'll clearly see that in his home, it was all about warm love and tender care. So in the end, they have made a Home and a strong @CAPS4 relationship together and with other people. The author's family @CAPS5 in their home people that they considered Family, and this right here is a mood, well, a caring mood that fills the air with affection.
853	12679	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of our lives, the mood of the author in the memoir was that he was deeply thankful for everything he got. So, like, the mood was quiet and loving. I picked quiet because he has grown up and nothing really overly exciting happened in his life. He grew up in @LOCATION1, and his parents were from @CAPS1. His parents were very kind - hearted people and always wanted to give their kid a better life. He's always been truly grateful for his parents as they were the ones who made his life a bit uneventful. Also, I picked loved as a mood because in the article, it says ""always filled the air with not just scent in music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family"", meaning his mood was that he felt genuinely loved by his family. That's why I chose quiet and loving."
854	12680	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gentle and a sense of proudness. The author explains of how he felt about his parents who risked everything in order to give him a better future according to paragraph @NUM1. Throughout the whole memoir, the author feels proud of being from Cuba. He shows his pride of being Cuban by elaborately explaining the things he does and the things that they share in his culture. Last but least, he feels thankfulness according to paragraph @NUM2 because, through his parents and things from his country, he learned what family really means. He says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". Through the whole memoir, the author shows proudness of where he came from, from his parents, his country, and his neighborhood, which all contribute to the overall gentle and proud mood."
855	12681	5	3	The mood the author is creating is sad. Because he is vividly talking about his whole family, his house, and how he had so many wonderful and cherished good memories there, along with his first friend. Recalling these things makes the mood heavy with a tinge of melancholy, and this kind of mood is indeed sad as it brings a sense of longing and loss.
856	12682	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", I think the author was incredibly grateful and overjoyed at that moment. I believe he was happy because he was laughing about how Narciso was consistently in a good mood. She always had a beaming smile and a positive attitude. Also, he loved how she adored cooking in the kitchen with everyone, sharing recipes and having a great time. Moreover, she still cherished her ritual song that she sang with her family, creating a warm and loving atmosphere. This shows that the story was filled with positive emotions and a sense of togetherness."
857	12683	5	3	"The mood that was created by this author was love. It was evident in the way he vividly described his house. ""The passionate Cuban music filled the air, gently mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen. Cooking and music are usually things you associate with love, and love brings happiness. The author also talks about his ""close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a helping hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This also shows that the mood in this memoir is love, the love of cooking, the love of music, and the love of family. Another place where it showed love in the memoir was in this quote. ""My Parents always kept their arms and their door wide open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even though these people aren't blood - related, they still look out for each other and knew they had someone reliable to lean on. The apparent mood in this story was love, and the family had an abundance of it, making the memoir a heart - warming read."
858	12684	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is Love. In paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the joyful congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the idyllic backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that there will always be a deep well of love and a sense of pure happiness in your home if you just respect your friends and your loved ones. When you show respect, you build strong bonds, and these bonds create a loving environment. Life would be good as you are surrounded by people who care about you and share in your joys."
859	12685	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two, the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These carefully chosen words set the warm and inviting tone for the rest of the memoir in which love and helping the community are key themes. It gives me the distinct feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open, friendly arms even as a complete stranger. The home seems to radiate a sense of acceptance and kindness. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends by speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love. This shows that the love and community spirit were not just limited to the home but extended to the whole neighborhood.
860	12686	5	3	"The mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness. Reading this made me feel very thankful. The author thanks his parents several times. He talks about how he learned how to cook from his parents with patience and care and says ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" in paragraph @NUM1, and in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I think those specific quotes from the memoirs clearly show how deeply grateful the author is feeling. Reading this made me feel grateful for what I have, and it made me think of all the things my parents did for me and the sacrifices they made. I also think the mood is happy because the author is looking back at his life and states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and loving home."" This made my mood become happy as it reminds us of the power of family love. Overall, the memoir effectively conveys the author's emotions of happiness and gratitude."
861	12687	5	3	The mood is a warm, genuinely happy feeling. In this setting, the home is a haven of safety and one of those idyllic, perfect homes where nothing goes awry. It is a caring abode filled with numerous friends and family who have been part of the household for a long time, creating a sense of enduring comfort and joy.
862	12688	5	3	"The mood that the author creates is a kind of contented happiness for what he has. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of their cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This quote clearly shows how the author views the different cultures uniting together, highlighting the positive and inclusive atmosphere in the neighborhood."
863	12689	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author's narrative is truly shocking. First, on page 23 paragraph 4, Rodriguez wrote, ""I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba."" Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never met her real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important because early in the memoir she said her surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came to eat dinner. In conclusion, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the story is shocking as her real grandparents came to the United States in 1970. She wanted to write this because she wanted to teach the reader to know the real definition of family, which goes beyond blood relations."
864	12690	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a loving and caring mood. In the second paragraph, he vividly describes the house as filled with the rich, flavorful culinary cooking of his parents. The passionate Cuban music fills the air, and the enticing aromas of the kitchen waft through their warm home. He tells that in their house, they often have feasts. Also, they invite many immigrants into their house and let them stay until they can leave on their own or find a place to live. He describes that family has nothing to do with blood relatives; everybody in their neighborhood is family, and they care for each other and any of the people who need help. At the end, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" He tells how they taught him love and the real definition of family, and he describes their house as being a warm, inviting place that truly feels like home."
865	12691	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and happiness, emphasizing how family and friends are intertwined. In the memoir, he elaborates on how his mom and dad selflessly gave up everything for their child and his life. They had to completely change their lives after leaving Cuba. For instance, in Cuba, his dad had worked in a laboratory, and his mom had studied chemical engineering, and they might have to forgo these careers. This sacrifice and the unwavering love they showed create the warm and emotional mood in the memoir, highlighting the true meaning of family and the lengths parents will go for their children.
866	12692	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is one of deep - seated gratitude and contentment. The author conveys this mood through the carefully chosen quotes he inserts. ""I was born into this simple house, which was situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This quote indicates that the author did not place great importance on the house's appearance, price, or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is truly grateful for all the people that he now considers his ""family"". Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". The sense of gratitude is right there in the quote. The author also adds some phrases in parentheses, like ""(after which I am eternally grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"". These phrases clearly show that the author is happy and grateful with his life. The next quote further emphasizes that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". Overall, the memoir is a beautiful testament to the power of gratitude and the true meaning of family."
867	12693	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of friendship and love. When the author's parents moved to the United States, they painstakingly created a traditional home, with the heart of it being the kitchen. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the delicious aromas of the kitchen."" During the kitchen celebrations throughout childhood, friends and family formed the perfect backdrop to their life. The author learned that '""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.' The neighborhood where the author lived was made up of many different cultures, yet they blended harmoniously with each other to form a small community of honest, hard - working immigrants who were always ready to help others when they themselves were in need. ""My parent's always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" The many immigrants gave up their lives in Cuba to move to the US to make a better life for their children, even though they were unfamiliar with the language and culture. The author will always be thankful to her parents for this selfless act. There is no way to fully show her thanks for her parents' love and sacrifice that they showed to her when she was just a child, and for showing her the importance of family and friends. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" They didn't just change it; they did it through the power of love and friendship. In essence, this memoir beautifully captures the essence of a loving and inclusive family."
868	12694	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker, Narciso Rodriguez, reveals what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba, out of love. As mentioned, his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing well that they would receive the same kindness in return. They cared deeply for their children's future, which led them to leave behind their families, friends, and established careers in the country they loved. Although ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships,"" they did what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house became the perfect place for them to be together as a family. ""The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just enticing scent and lively music but also life and love"". This memoir made me draw a parallel between this family and mine, as they are strikingly similar. Without love, it isn't truly a family, which is why at the end of the word ""family"", the i, l, y stand for ""i love you"". In conclusion, the memoir is a touching ode to the power of family love."
869	12695	5	3	This memoir gives me a sort of warm, cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood - related to you, I immediately think of my friends and the reliable people I can count on. They are my family too. He also elaborates on how a house is not necessarily a home; it can't be a home without memories, the presence of your family, and someone or something that you can whole - heartedly trust. Lastly, he tells us about how extremely grateful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to cherish deeply. This piece makes me pause and think about my own family and home, and it makes me truly appreciate them. In the end, the memoir serves as a gentle reminder of the significance of family and home in our lives.
870	12696	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very positive and reassuring one. It is a good feeling that comes from the author's explanation of how he lived in a real - life situation. Having family come to live with you until they get back on their feet, having family all around you, and realizing that you've turned your ""house into a Home"" are all heart - warming aspects. Endless celebrations that encompass joy and togetherness form a beautiful backdrop to life in their warm home. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr. had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In the new place, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The unwavering faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. This is what I perceived as the author's mood in the memoir, a blend of hope, sacrifice, and family love."
871	12697	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, caring, and full of gratefulness. Throughout the memoir, the author continuously and sincerely mentions how deeply grateful she is to her parents and how much she whole - heartedly loves them. She says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author means that she's truly thankful that her parents love her so much that they were willing to give up their home, stable jobs, and dear friends, all just to give her a better life. She also says that ""what they [her parents] did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" Narciso is stating that it takes an enormous amount of courage to move forward into an unknown future, and she's extremely grateful that her parents had the bravery to do so. The quote clearly shows the loving, caring, and grateful mood expressed in the memoir by the author, making the readers feel the depth of her emotions."
872	12698	5	3	"The mood is a complex mixture of various things, and it's really hard to precisely define with all the emotions the author throws around. However, the strongest feeling is unity and a sense of family. I'm not entirely sure if family can be strictly called an emotion, but I think it can be described by several emotions. One of them, of course, is unity, or as he puts it, ""great solidarity and friendship"". It's rather sweet how he characterizes family as the bonds you form with people, in contrast to other cultures where family is mainly based on blood ties and family always comes first. So, in a way, I think his way of thinking stems from his unique cultural background. But also, he adds a bit of sadness, yet overall, he seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"", and as he says ""I learned the real definition of family"", so apparently, he has truly grasped the essence of real happiness, which makes his account all the more touching."
873	12699	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is one of pure happiness, deep - seated peace, and heartfelt gratitude. Narciso is genuinely thankful for all that his parents had selflessly sacrificed and patiently taught him. His overall tone in the memoir is smoothly translated into a happy and peaceful mood. Narciso writes ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life to our warm home."" The tone in this quote is calmly friendly, as Narciso vividly explains the immense happiness of his life at home. By saying his house was ""warm"" with continuous celebrations for family and friends, it effectively constructs the peaceful mood of the memoir. Narciso goes on to explain that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" Here, Rodriguez further adds to the peaceful mood by speaking of the generosity and care towards family. It is the beautiful idea of family that fueled his loving childhood. The mood turns to profound gratitude as Narciso thanks his parents for giving him a better life, though they had to endure difficult jobs and harsh conditions. He expresses that he had ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The concepts of family, love, and generosity that Narciso learned from his parents formed the solid basis of the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir, as well as his life, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
874	12700	5	3	"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truly truthful, deeply grateful, and highly pride - inducing. ""Passionate Cuban music... Filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). The former quote, found in paragraph @NUM1, vividly described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a strong sense of family love which every person yearns for in life. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM3). Anyone who can make such sacrifices for the better life of their family is truly a good person. That is the family love I am describing, being selfless and loving towards other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@NUM4). That was a quote from paragraph @NUM4. It clearly shows that one has to be truly thankful for the sacrifices people make for them. All of these elements make up the qualities of a wonderful family life, which the author beautifully portrays in the memoir."
875	12701	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy because the atmosphere is filled with the warmth of family and friends, along with an abundance of joy and happiness. They considered everyone as family, even though the times were not the best for everyone. Also, his parents made great sacrifices, giving up a lot so he could have a good life in @LOCATION1. He is extremely grateful for his parents' decision to bring him to @LOCATION1 so he could enjoy a good life, even though they had to leave their familiar life in Cuba to come here for him. This deep - seated gratitude and the happy atmosphere of family and friends combine to create the warm and positive mood in the memoir, making it a heart - warming read that touches the readers' souls.
876	12702	5	3	The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed, caring kind of mood that envelops the reader like a warm embrace. Several parts of this work subtly yet effectively emphasize this soothing mood. The author often pens down his deep - seated love for his parents, highlighting their selflessness. He elaborates on how their selfless acts, like sacrificing their own desires for his well - being, have left an indelible mark on his heart. This emphasis on his love for his parents not only warms the narrative but also sets the tone of the relaxed, caring mood. Moreover, he repeats this sentiment many times throughout the memoir. This repetition acts like a gentle reminder, steadily building and reinforcing the mood with each mention. A final aspect that contributes to this mood is his vivid description of how everyone in his neighborhood was kind to each other. He tells of neighbors helping one another in times of need, sharing meals, and offering words of comfort. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood, making it a heartwarming read.
877	12703	5	3	Within the cozy walls of Narciso's childhood home, her young parents created their traditional @CAPS1 abode. Their heart, the very center of their family life, was the kitchen. Narciso's parents both whole - heartedly shared the cooking duties. With each stir of the pot and flip of the pan, they unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills to Narciso, who grew to love cooking with a passion. Quite the contrary, Narciso's neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was unfortunately prevalent. Her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, driven by the dream of giving their children a better life. They made the difficult sacrifice of leaving behind their family, friends, and well - established careers in the country they came from. I think her memory is a nice, happy one because with those memories, she clearly knows what her family went through, and it serves as a precious reminder of their love and determination.
878	12704	5	3	"The mood created by the author was a profound love from his family that permeates every page of the story. The author vividly describes ""a love of (Cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today"" and how ""Passionate Cuban music which I (the author) still adore today."" He recalls the warm evenings in the kitchen, the aroma of Cuban dishes filling the air, and the lively tunes of Cuban music playing in the background. This love was instilled in him by his parents, who were the keepers of these cultural treasures. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his ""parents always kept their arms and door open."" He explains that it was not just a physical act but a symbol of their open - heartedness and acceptance. I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home, especially with such genuine warmth. The author is speaking very lovingly at this point in the story, his words dripping with affection. The author also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement further sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a deep - seated, loving relationship. The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story as it makes the narrative truly touching."
879	12705	5	3	"I think the mood created by the author was a deep - rooted gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez sincerely wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" He remembers the times when his parents faced difficulties with unwavering resolve, which has always inspired him. I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about the countless sacrifices they made for him, like working long hours to provide for his needs. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home'. This mood makes the memoir a poignant and heartfelt account of family love and sacrifice."
880	12706	5	3	"In this excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1  talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is firmly established. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, @PERSON2 is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He remembers the joy of sitting around the table, enjoying delicious Cuban food while listening to the lively music. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present - day life, becoming an integral part of his identity. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much @PERSON1's parents sacrificed for his happiness. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of themselves, and for that, he is extremely grateful. Through these descriptions, the mood of gratitude is powerfully conveyed, making the reader appreciate the sacrifices and love within the family."
881	12707	5	3	"The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is truly distinct and unique compared to other things I have heard. I believe that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is attempting to convey is happiness, self - lessness, and gratitude. I think this because he vividly describes his parents as selfless individuals who take everyone into their small apartment, showing a great deal of kindness and generosity. I also think he is creating a sense of ""warmth"" by stating that his first birthday with his parents was comforting. That is the @CAPS1 I firmly believe the @CAPS3 is trying to create, and it leaves a lasting impression."
882	12708	5	3	The mood in this passage revolves around Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He frequently talks about his nationality with pride. He is extremely proud to be born in Cuba and is not afraid to openly say it. He is also married and lives in the @DATE1's in America. He often mentions his @NUM1 - bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey, sharing details about his living space. He also likes to talk about the new friends he has made here, the bonds he has formed. And, of course, he talks about his family and his childhood. His neighborhood is composed of Cubans and @CAPS1, creating a unique and diverse community. That was the essence of the memoir in this passage, painting a vivid picture of his life.
883	12709	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is clearly one of gratitude. It is expressed in a few notable ways. One way is in paragraph six where he sincerely says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This clearly shows that he is deeply grateful toward his parents because they made the brave move from Cuba to the @CAPS1. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 where he fondly says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admire to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents for their Cuban culture and specifically for passing on their wonderful cooking skills to him. These are the key reasons why the mood of the memoir is so strongly one of gratitude."
884	12710	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep gratitude. Narciso is truly thankful for his parents' unwavering support and love. When he expresses how he feels about his parents, he clearly states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" powerfully demonstrate that throughout his whole life, they were constantly there for him. They didn't just give him advice; they showed him the right way through their actions. When he talks about the @NUM2 important lessons he has learned from his parents, he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" clearly illustrate that they taught him the fundamental essentials of living. They also showed him the true meaning of family. He doesn't simply think family is just about blood relations, as he states ""It was here when I learned the real definition of 'family'"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The words ""definition of family"" show that he is truly thankful for them teaching him what family means to them. In conclusion, the mood of this passage is one of profound gratitude that permeates every part of the memoir."
885	12711	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a genuinely happy one. This is because in the memoir, Narciso was truly happy with all that his parents did for him. Their love, support, and the things they provided brought him great joy. Moreover, the neighborhood was a peaceful one. Everyone in the neighborhood reached out to help whoever needed it, creating a warm and friendly environment. This sense of community and the love from his parents combined to create a happy mood that is felt throughout the memoir, making it a heart - warming read.
886	12712	5	3	The memoir looks back on his childhood with deep - seated fondness, so I'd firmly call the mood wistful. Yes, the author masterfully creates a wistful mood by vividly talking about his childhood home, the close - knit friends he had, and his loving family. But... this wistfulness only endures until the end of paragraph @NUM1. After that, it gracefully transitions into a grateful mood. In this part, he's earnestly giving out thanks and in - depthly describing what his parents had to go through. If it is indeed possible to have two moods within a single memoir, then this one surely does. The moods are both wistful and grateful, which together make the memoir rich and emotionally resonant.
887	12713	5	3	The mood of the author and the memoir is clearly grateful. The author is extremely grateful for his parents. He is deeply thankful for them because they selflessly gave up their life for him. They made the difficult decision to move from their native country so that he could grow up in a better environment, specifically in @LOCATION1. His parents bravely quit their jobs and traveled far, all with his well - being in mind. He is also grateful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones with whom he shares meals, has fun playing, and spends quality time. He takes care of them, and in return, they take care of him. They serve as his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends. He is also thankful for his culture. All his delicious food along with the cherished traditions come from Cuba. Overall, the author's gratitude permeates the memoir, making it a heart - warming read.
888	12714	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir is a complex blend of sadness and happiness, and it truly holds the reader's interest. I think that this memoir is a well - crafted one, and I particularly liked the title of it, Narciso Rodriguez. The combination of these two contrasting moods makes the memoir more relatable and engaging. It allows the readers to experience a wide range of emotions, just like in real life. In conclusion, the unique mood and the appealing title make this memoir a worthwhile read.
889	12715	5	3	"The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. At first, the mood the author skillfully crafted was @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso poignantly explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. So, by carefully reading the excerpt, based on the poverty and the hardships his family endured, it makes you naturally grow @CAPS1 for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt, it states, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" And for this valuable lesson, I will never forget that house or its kind - hearted neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. Throughout the excerpt, the author beautifully explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" in the neighborhood. Therefore, that's why I think love is another prominent mood created by the author. These are the well - founded reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt, which together make the text emotionally powerful."
890	12716	5	3	In this memoir, the mood was effectively created by Narciso and his family. @PERSON2's family created the mood by bringing all of the family members together, whether in their old, familiar home in Cuba or their new, unfamiliar home in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 brought the mood into this memoir by whole - heartedly loving his family and consistently telling them every day that he is thankful for everything that they did for him, from when he was just a helpless child to when he has grown up. Also, @PERSON2's family showed great kindness by taking in people when they had nowhere to go and letting them stay with them until they got back on their feet. This selfless act further enriches the mood of the memoir, making it a story full of love and compassion.
891	12717	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in numerous ways. The predominant mood that the author crafted was confusing. It is confusing because such a mood appears more than one too many times within the text. Some of the distinct moods are happiness, proudness, sadness, and other similar ones. This is because the memoir delves into Narciso Rodriguez's life. In the end, the mood created by the author can't be precisely described since there are simply too many different moods intertwined.
892	12718	5	3	The author creates a somber but happy mood and vividly shows somber parts and happy parts in the narrative about a boy whose parents immigrated. His house, where he spent his formative years, was what he grew up in, and his parents infused it with a distinct Cuban twist, adding a unique cultural flavor to their living space. Overall, this blend of somber and happy elements enriches the story of the boy and his family's experience.
893	12719	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of clear - cut happiness. In almost all of the paragraphs, he elaborately talks about how deeply he loves his parents and his Cuban culture. Narciso specifically details how his parents transformed their everyday house into a warm and inviting home. That is precisely why I firmly think Narciso is brimming with happiness in this memoir. In paragraph 4, it clearly states ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."" This quote further solidifies the happy mood that pervades the memoir."
894	12720	5	3	"The author is extremely happy and thoroughly satisfied with the family he has and all that his family has done for him. The author sincerely appreciates what his parents have done, not only for him but also for other parents who immigrated from Cuba. He whole - heartedly dedicates all that he has learned, such as cooking delicious Cuban dishes, having proper manners, and forming lasting friendships, to his parents. The author ""admires the strength and perseverance and has thanked them repeatedly."" Overall, the author firmly believes that he could not have had a better family. They have shown him the true way to live, and that is exactly what a family should achieve, making life meaningful and fulfilling."
895	12721	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our Lives openly shared his innermost feelings, cherished traditions, and deep - seated love he shared with his family during his growing - up years. Narciso and his mom and dad were Cuban. They wholeheartedly shared their rich Cuban traditions with one another and were always warm and welcoming, not only to each other but also to other people. Narciso's family was incredibly generous to others and freely shared with everyone around them. They were all kind - hearted towards one another and lived a traditional Cuban lifestyle. Throughout the memoir, Narciso effectively emphasized a mood centered around the love and true meaning of family, making the readers feel the strong family bond.
896	12722	5	3	In this memoir it delves deeply into what the true meaning of selflessness and a home truly is. At the very beginning of this memoir, it elaborately describes how their parents were well - aware of the hardships and struggles of life. They would whole - heartedly invite people into their humble home and offer support until those individuals managed to get back on their feet. It took at least five long years until the parents could finally afford a house of a decent size. Even though his parents left Cuba, they made a sincere and continuous effort to keep all their cherished Cuban traditions alive. His parents had a great passion for cooking and patiently taught Narciso all their culinary skills. They also frequently played traditional Cuban music, filling the house with a warm and familiar atmosphere. Moreover, they instilled in him the value of being selfless. They would warmly invite people over, regardless of whether they belonged to the same race or not, because for them, it simply didn't matter. Through these actions, the memoir shows that true home is built on love, selflessness, and the preservation of one's roots.
897	12723	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is one of profound love and unity. As clearly stated in the text (@CAPS1 @NUM1), ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This vividly indicates that the people within the story were not just casually associated; they were closely - knit, full of love, and highly unified. This memoir gave me a distinct feeling that a mere house does not qualify as a home until it is filled with love. The description ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" further enhances this sentiment, as it paints a picture that evokes a strong sense of warmth and love. In essence, the memoir beautifully demonstrates that love and unity are the cornerstones that transform a physical space into a real home."
898	12724	5	3	"In my opinion, the author creates the mood in the memoir by skillfully setting the scene and vividly describing her childhood. She details where she was born and the reasons why her parents came to this place. The reason I believe this is because the mood is essentially the underlying feeling in the story, such as being sad, happy, lonely, or silent. These emotions intricately shape the setting, which encompasses the where, when, and time of the story. Some telling examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" This specific description of the place and time sets a certain tone. Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is extremely thankful for her Cuban heritage, and she shows that her home is more about relationships than just physical space. In this memoir, the mood effectively creates the setting, making the story more immersive and evocative."
899	12725	5	3	"I particularly enjoyed this memoir. The author did an outstanding job at creating a palpable sense of love and comfort while skillfully telling his story. The first sentence that really caught my attention was in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" To me, this sentence is all about making people feel completely at ease and at home. It effectively projects a strong sense of family within the story. The feeling of love was seamlessly incorporated into the story at paragraph @NUM2, when the author began to talk about his family. Especially where the author had said ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The family's love was all - encompassing; they loved everybody and used their love to assist struggling people or those who simply wanted to visit. They helped these individuals get back on their feet and provided them a place to stay in their home. This story was truly brimming with numerous examples of love and comfort, and I really relished reading every bit of it."
900	12726	5	3	The mood in the story is that of a family who made a brave attempt to move from their home country to start an entirely new life in a foreign land. This family likely faced a mix of emotions - excitement for the new opportunities that awaited them in the new country, yet also anxiety about leaving behind their familiar surroundings, friends, and family. They might have been filled with hope as they envisioned a better future, but at the same time, they were probably nervous about adapting to a new culture, new language, and new way of life. Despite these uncertainties, their determination to start afresh is palpable. Through this journey, the story captures the essence of resilience and the pursuit of a better life, showing that with courage, a family can overcome the challenges of relocation and build a new home.
901	12727	5	3	"The mood the author created in this memoir was one of deep - seated pride. I could clearly tell that the mood was like that because he would frequently and fondly talk about his parents and the immense sacrifices they made. They gave up so much to come to this new land. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it poignantly says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved."" I could tangibly feel the pride in that passage because he is highlighting how his parents left almost everything behind, essentially for him. Also, he mentions how his parents, despite not being the wealthiest, always opened their arms to whoever needed help. He gave numerous vivid examples throughout the memoir that strongly and unmistakably showed the mood of pride he crafted in this memoir. This consistent portrayal of his parents' selflessness and his admiration for them truly solidifies the proud mood of the piece."
902	12728	5	3	The author creates a palpable mood of happiness in the memoir. He carefully states heart - warming memories of his childhood that made him genuinely happy. He fondly mentions the deep love he had for cooking with his parents, recalling the laughter and shared moments in the kitchen. He also describes music as a source of intense passion and reveals that he still adores it even to this very day, perhaps reminiscing about the times when music filled their home. He vividly describes how wonderful his neighborhood was and emphasizes that they were a close - knit community, where everyone looked out for one another. Then he starts to explain that a significant part of his family was not just blood - related but included other kind - hearted people who became like family. He further elaborates that his parents were extremely self - sacrificing individuals, always putting the needs of their family and community first. So, it was an overwhelmingly good mood in which the author wrote the memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of joy and contentment.
903	12729	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, the author effectively shows a very strong mood that is intricately related to the piece. The emotions skillfully used to create the mood include passion, unity, and gratitude. The mood of this memoir is brimming with passion. Narciso vividly talks about his family's intense passion for their Cuban heritage, and how they whole - heartedly shared it with him. This sharing was a crucial component in transforming that house into a warm and loving home, and thus, it became an integral part of the mood that Rodriguez wanted to represent. ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... love of cooking... passionate Cuban music..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM1). I could also keenly feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray. "".. the congregation of family and friends..."" The author repeatedly mentions that his parents and he were always welcoming distant relatives to stay at the house, and many friends and family would gather to share delicious dinners with them. The author even paints a vivid picture of his community as a ""... a close - knit community..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM2). Lastly, a profound sense of gratitude runs like a strong thread along the spine of this piece. The author clearly notes that his parents were a huge and indispensable part of his life, exposing him to his rich culture, wonderful family, and great friends, and providing him with a loving home. He doesn't even have to explicitly write how grateful he is; it is so clearly evident. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (Rodriguez, @NUM3). The author successfully created a mood filled with passion, unity, and gratitude, and all of these emotions are clearly and powerfully evident in the text, making the memoir a truly moving read."
904	12730	5	3	"The mood the author creates is one of pure happiness. He has not a single negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents selflessly sacrificed everything for him so that he could have a better life, always putting his needs before their own. Also, the feel of his home greatly reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment, as described in paragraph @NUM1 which states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" The reader can really sense that he deeply loved his home and family, and this love is clearly reflected upon the overall mood of the writing, leaving a lasting impression of joy and contentment."
905	12731	5	3	"Growing up in this unique environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with merely being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up mostly of Spanish - speaking people. We shared a common culture, traditions, and values. Neighbors would often come together for festivals, sharing food and stories. These interactions made it clear that family could be formed through shared experiences and mutual support. The bonds we created in that neighborhood were as strong, if not stronger, than those of blood. It was a realization that has stayed with me, teaching me the true meaning of family and community."
906	12732	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and family - like. The author proceeds to vividly describe his family, who were loving yet poor. His family supported him as he grew up in a warm, happy, and loving home. They took the time to cook delicious, home - made food, and often invited the relatives over to enjoy these meals together. The author shows that no matter whether you're rich or poor, you can still have a closely - knit family that brings joy and comfort.
907	12733	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described as both happy and thankful. I say that because the author elaborately talked about how his parents were extremely caring and selfless individuals. They always went out of their way to help out people in need, whether it was with a kind word or a practical deed. The author loved how he grew up immersed in his Cuban culture, with its unique traditions and values, and how he would never forget those precious memories. He said that was one household full of warmth and love that he would never forget, as it shaped him into the person he is today.
908	12734	5	3	"The mood created by the author is that he is really happy that his parents moved to America to live close to friends and family. This is evident because in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went -- and there was always someone temporarily staying with us."" The constant presence of family brought a sense of warmth and togetherness, making the house a lively and loving place. It was clear that the author cherished these moments of family closeness that were made possible by the move."
909	12735	5	3	"I feel that the moods created by the author in the memoir are happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is emphasizing that his parents were kind - hearted and they worked diligently. Their hard work and kindness created a positive and nurturing environment, which made him happy. Another mood I think is that he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment instilled a great sense of family unity. His family whole - heartedly welcomed other refugees from Cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country, showing a spirit of generosity and community. Thanks to what he grew up with, he learned the real definition of family, which is about love, support, and inclusion. The last mood I feel the author created was that he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents' love and sacrifice."" He is grateful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the moods are in the memoir."
910	12736	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a distinct mood for the readers. The mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love. There are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love. For example, in paragraph two, the author talks about the simple apartment that him and his parents lived in as a wonderful place. He does this because he is deeply thankful to his parents as he loves them unconditionally. The paragraph says, ""and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Some people might not be as grateful about simple things like cooking, but Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy for even the little things they did for him. Instead of simply calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are affectionately called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily."" This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are regarded as family. Also, Narciso's parents graciously allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about their well - being. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso sees what his parents did with their lives as an amazing thing because he loves them so much. When this memoir is read, the mood of love is strongly expressed, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
911	12737	5	3	In this memoir the author creates a deep - seated feeling of gratefulness. @PERSON1 is truly grateful for his parents' unwavering unselfishness and the rich heritage they've passed down to him. He holds a profound love for his home country of Cuba, with its vibrant culture and history. @PERSON1 is also deeply thankful for his grandparents, who have been a source of wisdom and love. He adores his home in @LOCATION1, appreciating the unique charm and warmth it offers. He is grateful for growing up in @LOCATION1, where he made countless memories. He is also thankful that his grandparents came to @LOCATION1, as their presence added so much to his life. Overall, the memoir is filled with the author's heartfelt gratitude.
912	12738	5	3	"There is a distinct mood artfully created by the author in the memoir. One way in which the mood is created is by vividly explaining how the warm and inviting life in the narrator's house was carefully crafted. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This passage helps create the mood of the memoir because it paints a clear picture of how the narrator grew up in a nurturing environment. Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how incredibly caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This simple yet powerful statement gave the memoir a light - hearted and happy mood. A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The narrator explained in detail how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another. As you can see, the author of the memoir successfully created a pleasant mood in the memoir."
913	12739	5	3	"In the memoir the author's tone is undeniably loving. The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is brimming with pride for being Cuban, highlighting the unique traditions and values. In @LOCATION1 two, he specifically states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents' ""rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" passed on to him, which shows the importance of family traditions. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven, his tone is once again loving and grateful. It is very noticeable in the very last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sentence sums up the author's loving and appreciative attitude towards his family and home."
914	12740	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is clearly happy. The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir is thoroughly enjoying their lives and they're not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didn't hesitate for a moment. Their family was in high spirits, they partied joyfully, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" This shows their inclusive and happy nature. In this memoir, Narciso enjoyed his life to the fullest and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2, Narciso exclaimed with emotion that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which vividly showed their happiness in this memoir. Overall, the memoir radiates a happy mood."
915	12741	5	3	"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, grateful, and happy. The reason why I think the author is passionate is because he elaborately talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, it's where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they consider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things, you have to be really caring and lovable, showing a deep - seated commitment to others. I think that the author shows gratitude because he repeatedly says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices they made to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isn't enough to prove how grateful he is. His parents transformed a three - bedroom apartment into a place he now whole - heartedly calls home, and that is what he is truly grateful for. I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his childhood life growing up in @LOCATION1, while still embracing the cultural traditions of Cuba. He is now a successful fashion designer, which is a result of his happy and fulfilling upbringing. All in all, these are the three moods that I think Narciso conveys in the story."
916	12742	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this warm - hearted environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They, with their kind actions and sincere words, showed me the true meaning of family through their lives, and these precious teachings have been the unshakable basis of my life. But, in reality, there is truly no way to fully express my deep - seated gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the vivid demonstration of how important family and friends are. I will never forget how my parents, with their love and hard work, turned this simple house into a real home filled with warmth and happiness."
917	12743	5	3	"The author does an excellent job of creating many moods in this memoir. One of the prominent moods is love. Love is a prevalent mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents, out of pure kindness, took in ten people who needed somewhere to stay. They knew that those people would do the same selfless thing for them in similar circumstances. Another clear example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows the deep - rooted love of parents for their children. The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which is another significant mood. It achieves this by having the author point out how small his house was and how his parents, despite the limited resources, did everything within their power to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, reflect deeply, and see how much their parents have done for them, thus evoking a strong sense of gratitude."
918	12744	5	3	Well first, the author feels a mix of happiness and excitement but he also feels a tinge of sadness because he is moving to @LOCATION1. In 1961, he was born into a loving family. During that time, he met a special friend who was his babysitter. She lived upstairs from them and was his first real friend. He has a large number of family members, but when he moved to @LOCATION1, his mom and dad took in people who needed a home, just until they could get back up on their feet. He really wants to see his grandparents who can't leave until 1970. But he often told his mom and dad that he will always be deeply grateful to them for their boundless love and great sacrifice. He frequently expressed that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done. He also often told them of his sincere admiration for their strength and perseverance and whole - heartedly thanked them for all they had done.
919	12745	5	3	"The mood would be loving and caring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents truly treasured family and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping hand and to always keep his door open to those in need. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" It was a close - knit community where everybody knew everybody well. Nobody was a stranger; there was a strong sense of unity and belonging. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us"". His parents instilled in him the invaluable lesson of how important family and friends are, and this lesson has stayed with him throughout his life."
920	12746	5	3	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @CAPS1 swings. This author does a remarkable job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2. I like this change because, it smoothly transitions from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about @ORGANIZATION2's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of @NUM3 different backgrounds on the two different @CAPS3 of people. It talks about how @PERSON1's parents were immigrants and weren't raised in favorable conditions, but they had a strong desire for their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter in @LOCATION1 were rich and could do anything they wanted without much restraint. I am just completely blown away by how this author deftly changes his moods in the story.
921	12747	5	3	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez', the overall mood is one of pure happiness, and it's crafted in a way that's meant to truly touch the reader's heart. In his memoir, he elaborately explains things he found extremely fun and amusing and still holds dear today, like ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)"". ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship."" This clearly shows that the neighborhood he lived in was a happy and united community. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly."" This statement effectively conveys that he wants the readers to deeply understand how caring and loving his parents were. Through these details, the memoir successfully evokes a warm and positive atmosphere that resonates with the readers."
922	12748	5	3	"There is a distinct, heart - warming kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. This mood is artfully portrayed in multiple ways. One prominent way the mood is portrayed is by vividly telling us about @PERSON1's parents. It's described how their home is always wide - open, a place where people are always welcome, and there's always a large number of people gathered around the dinner table, sharing meals and stories. Another way they portray this mood is by @PERSON1 sincerely stating ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are."" All these elements combine to show the warmth and closeness of a family - like atmosphere in this memoir, @PERSON1, leaving a lasting impression of a loving and inclusive environment on the readers."
923	12749	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, the author skillfully creates a mood of profound love and admiration. For example, the statement ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" clearly shows the boundless love the author had for all people. ""This environment"" specifically refers to the situation of seeing friends of the family (who are also immigrants) very frequently at a time when racism was unfortunately a normal part of life in the US. The author elaborately talks about the deep - seated love and respect everyone had for each other in that community. Another prime example of the mood is ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Throughout the poem, the author speaks of his parents with great admiration. It's quite evident that he is deeply inspired by them, and he effectively makes the reader admire them too. All in all, the moods being created in the memoir are love because of the close - knit community he talked about and grew up in and admiration because of the way he wrote about his parents, making the memoir a touching and inspiring read."
924	12750	5	3	The author of Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso Rodriguez, masterfully makes the @CAPS1 feel genuinely happy and warmly welcome. When he vividly talks about the different cultures and races coming together and forming a strong sense of solidarity, it makes the @CAPS1 feel that they are welcome among everyone, regardless of their race. When he describes his own culture and his house, where people are invited over for dinner every night, it creates an atmosphere that just feels full of happiness and a sense of welcome. When he openly shows his deep love for his home and the culture his parents had shown him, it makes the @CAPS1 feel truly uplifted. In essence, that is how Narciso Rodriguez creates @CAPS1 in the memoir, by carefully choosing to talk about happy and uplifting topics that resonate with the readers on an emotional level.
925	12751	5	3	"The mood that the author gives throughout this entire article, or rather, memoir, is a beautiful blend of happiness and family. All during the memoir, he passionately speaks of how he deeply cherished his family. In paragraph @NUM1, he says ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author repeatedly emphasizes how much he is truly thankful to his parents and how he loves the fact that they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is precisely what he meant when he said he could never fully show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is a powerful combination of love, family, and happiness, which makes it a heart - warming and memorable read for the audience."
926	12752	5	3	The mood in the memoir encompasses a variety of emotions, and here are some of them. First, it evokes a warm feeling, as if a gentle embrace is surrounding the reader. It also brings about a happy mood because the author expresses that he cannot thank enough those who have done so much for him. This sincere gratitude is palpable and spreads joy. And lastly, it tugs at the heartstrings, making you feel a bit sad as it talks about people in need of help. Additionally, it shows that they love Cuba and cherish their heritage, which adds a layer of sentimentality. These are some of the moods that this story effectively brings out, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
927	12753	5	3	"By writing the story, the author skillfully created a mood full of warmth and comfort, much like a cozy blanket on a cold day. The mood created in this story vividly shows how a family should be, a close - knit unit. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", it clearly shows that they deeply appreciate their family and share a strong bond. Their care for one another contributes to the mood by demonstrating love and warmth towards each other. A second aspect of the mood is when he fondly talks about his kitchen and how it holds great meaning for him. When he mentions the love of culinary skills and cooking that still lingers within him today, it creates a solemn mood that sets the gentle tone of the story. Third, when he talks about his neighborhood, @PERSON1 describes the immigrants in the area and how they come together despite their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and recognize that everyone is equal. This also sets the mood by highlighting that everyone should be kind to one another. These three parts effectively set the mood of the story, making it a heart - warming read."
928	12754	5	3	The mood is good and happy, filling the air with a sense of lightness. In this article, the mood is peaceful and positive, like a calm lake on a sunny day. It's a successful mood, and it also exudes gratefulness because @PERSON1 is truly grateful for everything they have received. This combination of positive emotions makes the article a pleasant read, leaving the reader with a smile on their face and a warm feeling in their heart.
929	12755	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author talks about the home where they grew up and the sacrifice and selflessness shown by their parents. The mood of this story is happy, and the author truly shows how much they love their parents and appreciate what they did for them. In paragraph two, when they mention their love for Cuban music and the wonderful culinary skills that their parents had and passed on to them, it's evident how these elements are deeply cherished. Another example of the mood of the story is shown in paragraph four when they talk about all the people who gathered at their kitchen table and how they were so helpful to the people they met through their neighborhood. The mood of the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was happy and loving towards all the people this person has ever met from that house, creating a heart - warming and endearing narrative."
930	12756	5	3	The mood created by this @CAPS1 is quite powerful. It makes the reader reflect deeply about his family and the sacrifices they have made for him. It makes you feel warm inside, like a soft glow is spreading through your body. It prompts you to think of family and friends, and also about your unique culture. And it also makes you pause and think about all the hardships your family has to endure for you. It also fills you with happiness as it makes you recall all the fun times you and your family have shared together. All in all, it's a great @CAPS5 that makes you feel a flood of emotions. It makes you think of the best things on earth, family and friends, and reminds you of the preciousness of these relationships.
931	12757	5	3	"The mood created is a profound sense of happiness and pride. As evident in paragraph @NUM1, it specifically states, ""community of honest, hardworking immigrants."" Being honest and hardworking are indeed two highly admirable qualities to possess. Moreover, in paragraph @NUM2, it mentions, ""they come to this country with such courage."" Undoubtedly, courage is a remarkable quality to have. These descriptions of the immigrants' positive traits evoke a feeling of pride in their achievements and the community they've built. And the sense of happiness stems from the realization of the positive impact they have. So, clearly, pride and happiness are the predominant mood conveyed."
932	12758	5	3	The mood is one of deep - seated gratitude, because it vividly shows how extremely grateful he is for his house, a place that provides him with shelter and comfort. Additionally, he is grateful for all the people that come over and become like family to him. These people bring warmth, companionship, and a sense of belonging. This overall atmosphere of gratitude makes the mood in the text a very heart - warming one.
933	12759	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a loving one. Rodriguez is fondly looking back at all the great memories of himself and his ""family"" when he was young. When living in New @CAPS1 as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home filled with warmth and care, and a very loving neighborhood where people supported and cared for one another. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming ""... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" He always had neighbors and friends over, whom he considered to be ""family."" There was a great deal of love in his neighbors' hearts, and so he grew up surrounded by a lot of love. But, of course, he loves his parents the most. In this memoir, Rodriguez is sincerely thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throughout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how incredibly great of a childhood he had, living in a great, loving neighborhood, with parents that love him a great deal. Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did, highlighting the importance of love and connection in his life."
934	12760	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is extremely happy and feels very lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there, as it has provided him with various opportunities and experiences. Second, Narciso loves his home deeply. He talks about how they transformed their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home, which is a beautiful blend of two cultures. For example, he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home, a place where family traditions are carried out, and how his parents taught him how to cook, a skill he is truly grateful for. Lastly, his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example, his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not, showing the close - knit relationship. Also, his ""real"" grandparents, who weren't his real grandparents because they were still in Cuba, were part of his extended family in spirit. Those are the reasons that create the author's mood in the memoir, a mood filled with love, gratitude, and a sense of belonging."
935	12761	5	3	"The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 is a delightful mix of happy, loving, and upbeat or lively. Happiness is clearly seen by the reader when he is explaining the way many different cultures ""come together in great solidarity and friendship."" @PERSON1 is genuinely happy he grew up here and is content with every aspect of his childhood in this neighborhood. The author has a deep - seated love for everything about this neighborhood. @PERSON1 especially loves that there are always people around their table, sharing meals and stories, and that extended family comes to see them, strengthening the family bonds. @PERSON1's writing is very lively, and he writes with great passion, which is palpable on every page. The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love, and life into his memoir is what makes it so engaging and interesting to read, and what makes the mood so fantastic, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
936	12762	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood crafted by the @CAPS1 clearly conveys that family is the most precious thing in life. Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoir, tenderly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This heartfelt statement underscores his deep - seated love for his parents and family. The @CAPS1 emphasizes that having family is far more valuable than money. In the memoir, it details how his parents left Cuba, penniless and jobless. However, their togetherness gave them the hope to persevere. Now, they reside in a @NUM1 - room house with their family. Undoubtedly, life would be an arduous journey without the support and love of family."
937	12763	5	3	I firmly believe the mood of the memoir is both happy and enlightening. The reason behind this belief is that when @CAPS1 someone migrates from a country plagued by poverty or unjust laws, this warm - hearted community or neighborhood readily takes them in. This community, composed of Cuban Spaniards and Italians, is a melting pot of people who have left their homelands in pursuit of a better life, either for themselves, their families, or their children. In conclusion, the mood of this memoir is undeniably happy as it offers an enlightening and welcoming space to be in.
938	12764	5	3	The author's mood in this memoir is profoundly thankful and appreciative. He explicitly states that he will always be grateful to his parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifices. He elaborates on the struggles they endured, starting in a cramped one - room apartment and gradually working hard enough to afford a move into a more spacious three - room apartment that he could finally call home. He describes how his parents uprooted their lives and started anew in @LOCATION1, taking on any available work they could find. They weathered their difficult times with the firm faith that this struggle would pave the way for a better future for themselves and their children. The author holds an immense amount of admiration for his parents' strength and perseverance. Through their experiences, he learned the true essence of 'family' and the art of loving. He is genuinely appreciative of all he has and the invaluable lessons of generosity and the importance of family and friends that his courageous parents imparted to him, which have become the very foundation of his life.
939	12765	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" penned by Narciso Rodriguez, the author successfully creates a heartwarming family mood. Rodriguez vividly talks about how family members are constantly coming and going. The memoir specifically states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" (paragraph @NUM1), painting a picture of a bustling and lively family environment. He also makes it clear that family isn't always defined by blood relations. Rodriguez mentions that his neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity..."" (paragraph @NUM1), highlighting the sense of community and togetherness. He further expresses that he is most grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Overall, Narciso Rodriguez truly crafts a mood that is overflowing with love, caring, and a strong sense of family."
940	12766	5	3	"In the @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" @PERSON2 manages to create a very distinct and palpable mood. I am of the opinion that the mood of the @CAPS1 is warm, caring, comforting, and extremely loving. The author's home is centered around family, but not just the blood - related kind. During a time when ""Racism was the norm and segregation prevailed,"" his neighborhood became a unified family. When Narciso Rodriguez describes this situation, the @CAPS1 exudes a comforting and loving aura. He @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This statement brings a happy, light - hearted feel to the article and is comforting as well. When Rodriguez @CAPS2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood undergoes a slight shift. It now becomes admiring, grateful, and compassionate. As Narciso Rodriguez describes his parents' struggles so that he could have a better upbringing @CAPS4 nicer than they did, one can truly feel his deep - seated gratitude and love. At this point, the mood is a beautiful blend of happiness, love, and compassion. This is precisely the mood created by the @CAPS1 by @PERSON2 from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives""."
941	12767	5	3	In the memoir the author sets up a warm and happy mood while fondly remembering his childhood home. He only carefully recounts the good things and the most vivid happy memories in the entire memoir. He also speaks with great affection of cherished childhood memories and how harmonious his community was and how loving his parents were. This nostalgic recollection truly captures the essence of a wonderful childhood.
942	12768	5	3	The mood in the story is very joyously happy. The author is deeply thinking about all the wonderful good times he had while growing up. He is enthusiastically talking about how he had such a fulfilling and content life in the house. How his parents bravely came there as immigrants and painstakingly made a life for themselves and then lovingly raised him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he cheerfully talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his patient parents taught him how to cook delicious meals. He sincerely thanked his parents because he was so overjoyed they created a close - knit family not just a physical home.
943	12769	5	3	"And throughout the memoir there is a constant and heartwarming mood, which is happiness. In the beginning of the memoir, @PERSON1 vividly describes his home, starting from about how it initially started to how it gradually became a wonderful ""home"". He said it had the lively sounds of ""a passionate Cuban music"" filling the air and the ""amazing aromas of cooking"" wafting through the rooms. Then in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 sincerely says that ""he loves his parents for their deep - seated love and great sacrifice""; and he continues with heartfelt words saying how extremely grateful he is toward them. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and loving home"". This is the beautiful mood expressed in the memoir."
944	12770	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates many moods within it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it clearly says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My kind - hearted parents always kept their arms wide open and their door unlocked to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would selflessly let anyone that was family in and wouldn't care about the inconvenience. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he earnestly says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice"". This is him clearly showing that he is grateful because he directly says it in the sentence and he also specifically tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the meaningful moods the memoir created."
945	12771	5	3	I think in my opinion is that the author was very at ease and confident with his words and his way of being human. His parents were originally from Cuba, and they were deeply into their rich culture and were very kind to others in their surrounding community. For an example, @CAPS2 says It was in this simple yet cozy house that my parents warmly welcomed other refugees to celebrate their safe arrival to the country and where I happily celebrated my first birthday. This shows the author's family's inclusive and loving nature.
946	12772	5	3	They author makes a mood like no other in this memoir. He creates a mood that enstills admiration and praise for his parents. He tries to express his admiration to his parents in words but can't because of all the great times they've shared. He makes a mood of happiness that will last forever in his memories and within the walls of the Kitchen, a place filled with so many cherished moments.
947	12773	5	3	"I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small, cozy house into a home full of love. In a two - bedroom, two - family house in Miami, Narciso's parents created a traditional Cuban home. A lot of delicious cooking happened in the house, with the aroma of Cuban spices filling the air. Family was always around which must've been incredibly fun, and all of this happening with lively Cuban music playing in the background. ""Joy filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen. Narciso makes his home seem like a very loving home, a place where family bonds were strengthened and traditions were kept alive."
948	12774	5	3	"The main character in the story is happy. This is because he got to move to the United States and be born here for a better life. He also loved growing up here with the rich Cuban traditions and the vibrant music as stated on paragraph 3 ""And for what I am eternally grateful,"" which I adore to this day. The new environment and the cultural heritage he carried with him made his life here fulfilling and full of joy."
949	12775	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he specifically named the soothing music that was playing and described all the family members who gathered around to eat with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking traditional Cuban dishes with care and love. I think the mood is peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. He only says the good things about them, like their kindness and hard - work. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as passing down the love of culinary arts. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and starting everything over again so that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family deeply and probably felt the warmth of everyone's affection when they all went over to his house, creating a sense of togetherness.
950	12776	5	3	"The mood created by the narrator in the memoir was one of gratitude towards his parents. In the memoir, the narrator thanks his parents for raising him the way they did, with values and love. In the article, he thanks them by saying things like ""my admiration"", ""my gratitude"", and ""generosity"". All these statements are true and they reflect his sincere mood towards his family. In conclusion, the mood was a combination of many things but, I choose gratitude because it reflects how he feels about his family the most, showing the deep - seated appreciation he has for all that his parents have done for him."
951	12777	5	3	Narciso was extremely proud that he was a Cuban immigrant, and he often spoke highly of how his parents had done so much for him. He realized, as noted in paragraph @NUM1, that family had nothing to do with being blood relatives. In a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United @ORGANIZATION1, all cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. He truly learned the true meaning of family. His parents had transformed a regular house into a home that he deeply loved. He was extremely grateful for the many sacrifices his parents made, which turned ordinary moments into lifetime experiences that he would never forget. He was so happy that little things had turned into great memories, and he couldn't wait to share them with the world. His story was a beautiful testament to the power of family and community in the face of adversity.
952	12778	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of pure happiness, a sense of safety, and heartfelt care. Narciso was fortunate to have parents who loved him unconditionally and was part of a very close - knit community. All the vivid descriptions of his family cooking together and neighbors sitting down to eat as one are enough to make anyone's heart feel warm and happy. Throughout the memoir, Narciso constantly emphasizes the deep care of his parents. One can clearly tell that Narciso's parents loved him from his respectful and affectionate attitude toward them. In paragraph @NUM1, when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" it powerfully shows his parents' selfless care for him. When the author writes, ""In our neighborhood,... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need,"" these two sentences give the reader a strong sense of safety and once again emphasize the all - encompassing care. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez successfully creates a mood of happiness, safety, and care that lingers with the reader long after they finish reading."
953	12779	5	3	"The author of this memoir creates a warm, loving, lively, and truly festive mood as he vividly describes his home. Several times, the author uses the word ""warm"" to describe the home. For example, he says ""the warmth of the kitchen,"" which immediately makes the reader feel as if they are standing in that cozy space. Any reader who reads this memoir gets the distinct feeling that it's a bright and inviting place filled with positive energy. The reader also gets the strong sense that everybody in this environment is loving and friendly, especially as the author talks about how immigrants from different places came together and formed great friendships. He also says his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" which paints a picture of a home full of acceptance and love. There was also a lot of life at his house. ""Endless celebrations [...] formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" He also wrote that 'Cuban feasts [...] always filled the air with not just scent and music but life.' From reading his memoir, we can clearly feel that his home was an amazing place to be during his childhood. Overall, he created a warm, inviting, and festive mood that makes the reader long for such a wonderful home environment."
954	12780	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of deep gratitude. The memoir was entirely centered around how Narciso Rodriguez greatly admired his parents' courage, selflessness, rich culture, proud heritage, remarkable strength, and unwavering perseverance. Narciso sincerely said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He also said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Throughout the memoir, not once did the author say anything negative about his experiences growing up. The focus was solely on how he is so extremely grateful for everything his parents did and sacrificed for him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author of the memoir was a happy and deeply grateful one, leaving the reader with a sense of the power of parental love and sacrifice."
955	12781	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a sort of profound grateful and appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeatedly expresses how incredibly grateful he is to have such courageous parents. For example, in the first few sentences of paragraph @NUM1, he states, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This passage clearly shows how grateful he is for his parents' self - sacrifice, as they did all this just to give him a better life. I can completely understand and would feel just as grateful for my parents if they had done such a thing for me, just as Narciso felt. His story is a powerful reminder of the sacrifices parents make for their children and the gratitude that should follow."
956	12782	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir are love, happiness, and @CAPS1. Love is one of the prominent moods as they whole - heartedly welcome people in need. As stated, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" It shows a deep - seated love that extends beyond blood relations. Happiness is also a key mood because Narciso is genuinely pleased with his parents. He clearly expresses, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is one of the moods because everyone in the neighborhood got along harmoniously. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This unity and amicable co - existence contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. In conclusion, these three moods of love, happiness, and @CAPS1 blend together to create a rich and heart - warming atmosphere in the memoir."
957	12783	5	3	The mood created by the memoir is exciting because he has a genuine passion for fashion design. He actively makes the story revolve around clothing design, which shows his enthusiasm for the field. He also feels happy because he has a strong affection for his home. He has skillfully turned a simple house into a warm and inviting home, filling it with his personality and love. However, he felt sad because he was initially born in a simple house. He yearned for a place where he could truly feel at home, a place that would offer him a sense of belonging. In conclusion, the mix of excitement, happiness, and sadness in the memoir gives it a complex yet relatable emotional depth.
958	12784	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is very significant. He effectively expresses love, appreciation, and unity. Narciso shows a great deal of love not only to his parents but also to his culture. He frequently mentions how thankful he is to have grown up surrounded by Cuban food and music. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he vividly says, ""...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" and, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Moreover, he shows appreciation towards his parents. Narciso often states how much he admires them for their bravery in coming to @LOCATION1. He elaborately talks about how they turned their simple house into a home in paragraph @NUM2. Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all Cuban, Spanish, or Italian immigrants, and they naturally tended to stick together. Overall, Narciso really learned what the word ""family"" means, which encompasses love, appreciation, and unity."
959	12785	5	3	"The mood created by the author was happy. The love of cooking that has stayed with the author to this day (and for which the author is eternally grateful) is a clear sign of this positive mood. Passionate Cuban music (which the author adores to this day) filled the air, beautifully mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents, for their love and sacrifice."" The author has often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than the author could ever do. They @CAPS1 the author with their lives, and these teachings have been the very basis of the author's life. The author's mother and father had come to this country with such great courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. In conclusion, the author's mood is a blend of happiness and gratitude towards their parents for giving them a better life and leaving behind their past."
960	12786	5	3	"In @PERSON1 from: Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author creates a warm and loving mood. When @PERSON1 talks about his parents and how they ""always kept their arms and their door open"", it sets a deeply loving mood. If one is so generously and consistently caring to do that, it clearly means they love and care about others whole - heartedly. Also, at the end of the memoir, Narciso says that he ""learned there about how to love"". @PERSON1 now says this about his house because his parents were always so upbeat and caring. Their positive and loving nature showed him what true love is. Being loved makes all people feel good inside, and this feeling is palpable throughout the memoir. In conclusion, the author successfully creates a warm and loving mood through @PERSON1's experiences with his parents."
961	12787	5	3	The mood of the author in the memoir is one of profound gratitude and thankfulness. Narciso's life seemed as ordinary as anyone else's would have been. They began with a simple house, which gradually transformed into a warm and inviting home. Narciso deeply appreciated that his parents selflessly brought the family to this land, Cuba, and cared for their children with the hope of a better life. Although they faced struggles, they also found happiness. His parents often welcomed neighbors and relatives to join them for meals. For Narciso, family was not just limited to his parents, sisters, and brothers. It included the neighbors who surrounded him and treated him with respect, just like family. This is why Narciso Rodriguez felt that having a home like that was truly a privilege. He felt grateful and thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice. He admired his parents' strength and perseverance. He'll never forget the wonderful memories the gracious neighborhood brought him, nor how his parents turned that simple house into a home filled with love and warmth.
962	12788	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was highly emotional as he vividly describes his childhood experiences and the journey of how he grew up. Through his detailed recollections, the readers can feel the depth of emotions associated with his upbringing. Whether it was the joys of childhood adventures or the challenges he faced, the author's words bring these moments to life, making the mood of the memoir truly impactful.

963	12789	5	3	The mood in this story about @PERSON1 is quite complex. Moving can be extremely difficult for some people, while for others, it is an @CAPS1 - a chance for a fresh start. Most people dread leaving their @CAPS2, established work, and dear friends behind. However, for other people, it's a new opportunity to meet new people, land a better job, or attend a better @CAPS2 for their education. I can truly understand how hard it must have been to move from Cuba to the United States. That's not just a short distance like moving to a neighboring town or a street over; it's across the world. But @PERSON1 made a friend, and his mom and dad love him very much. They always manage to have food on the table, so at least they don't have to worry about starving. It was indeed a step down moving to the United States, going from having good jobs in Cuba to facing more difficult circumstances. Despite these challenges, the mood in this story is very loving between the family and all their friends, which provides a sense of comfort and hope.
964	12790	5	3	The author in the memoir is filled with happiness because they bought a new house in New Jersey. A baby was born in the house, and her @CAPS1 is Narciso. She is @NUM1 years old now. The whole family is overjoyed. Their parents are from Cuba. They live in a beautiful house that has @NUM2 bedrooms, which provides enough space for everyone. In this house, the family members are always in high spirits. The new house in a new place, along with the addition of a new family member, has brought so much happiness to their lives, making their days full of joy and contentment.
965	12791	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very relaxed and happy. This is clearly shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the memoir states, ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in a warm home."" This description brings a very calm and peaceful mood, highlighting how their home serves as a place that brings everyone together. It makes the readers feel as if they are part of that warm and joyous gathering. Another example is in @CAPS1 @NUM3. @CAPS1 @NUM3 states: ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This sentence gives a ""welcome home"" and loved mood, evoking a sense of nostalgia and comfort. Overall, the author effectively conveys a mood of relaxation and happiness throughout the memoir, making it a heart - warming read."
966	12792	5	3	I think the mood was quite happy @CAPS2 as the @CAPS1 engaged in a talk about a well - known @PERSON2 named Narciso Rodriguez. It was mentioned that he lived in Cuba initially, and later his parents made the decision to move to the United States so that the entire family could be together. I firmly believe that the @CAPS1's mood is truly happy @CAPS2 because this story was simply great, a touching talk about a @CAPS3 and his parents' journey of moving to the United States. This heart - warming tale definitely set a happy mood.
967	12793	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is notably happy and warm. This pleasant mood is clearly shown in two distinct ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is deeply and forever grateful to his parents for bravely starting their lives over again so that he could live a good and prosperous life in @LOCATION1. This deep - seated gratitude is vividly shown in paragraph @NUM1 when he elaborately explains that his parents had a deep love for Cuba but selflessly left it so that their children could have a much better life in @LOCATION1. He sincerely gives his heartfelt thanks to his parents in paragraph @NUM2. This strong feeling of gratefulness significantly contributes to the warm, happy feel of the entire piece. Throughout the memoir, Narciso takes the time to explain to us the true essence of family. ""'... family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he clearly states in paragraph @NUM3. In paragraph @NUM4, he further elaborates that family means those who whole - heartedly care for and about you and stand by you steadfastly no matter what. This beautiful understanding of family definitely helps to make the piece exude a warm and happy atmosphere. Overall, these elements combine to create a memoir full of warmth and happiness."
968	12794	5	3	"I think the mood is supposed to be quite sad for many poignant reasons. One prominent reason is that he repeatedly keeps saying how his house isn't a home until the very end. For instance, he states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows his long - standing sense of displacement. Another reason is that his friends and family are all he has in his life. As he mentions, ""...how important family and friends are."" It implies a certain sense of isolation and reliance on them. Also, because he had to move, he found himself in a new place where he didn't know anybody. As the text says, ""...Originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" All these factors contribute to the overall sad mood of the story."
969	12795	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was irresistibly warm and inviting. The author skillfully made it feel as if I was truly right there in his neighborhood, experiencing everything firsthand. The author carefully took the ordinary things that most people usually take for granted and elaborately expanded on them. By doing so, he made the mood feel incredibly real. He managed to make the reader feel as though they were an integral part of the story, fully immersed in the events and emotions. This ability of the author to draw the reader in and create such a vivid mood is what makes the memoir so engaging.
970	12796	5	3	"The @CAPS1 that the author created was a truly warming @CAPS1. He vividly gave accounts of events from the past, which effectively created a content and comforting tone. He also used rich and descriptive language when talking about the delicious food, the lively music, and the close - knit family. In this memoir, it clearly stated that he highly appreciated his parents very much for their remarkable selflessness. In @NUM1, it specifically says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood @CAPS2"". This statement is clearly showing how well his family treated him. All in all, he successfully gave a really good and engaging tone in this story, making it an enjoyable read."
971	12797	5	3	"The author of the memoir meticulously creates a very loving, peaceful, and happy mood in the story. It is constantly stated that his house was always brimming with friends and family. Their presence filled the rooms with laughter and warmth, giving the story a very loving mood and clearly showing how they are all there for each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sentence vividly shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very grateful. He is always expressing how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. That is the mood of the memoir that permeates throughout the whole passage, leaving a lasting impression of love and gratitude."
972	12798	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is very moving and heart - felt. By the way the author tenderly writes about his family, one can just feel the warmth and love that his family provided for him. The quote, ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" clearly showcases the profound impact Narciso Rodriguez's parents had on his life. It also explains how skilled his parents were and how intelligent they were in nurturing his interests. The statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" makes it evident that Narciso most definitely loved his family. This memoir effectively conveys the deep - seated emotions of love and gratitude within the family."
973	12799	5	3	Throughout this story, there is a certain sense of fulfillment. It's like how these people got their dream home and this was it, a place where they could truly belong. Their parents came to this country not knowing the language or having a good education, yet they still became successful and managed to live in this house. This house became a place where these people learned to love, to cherish the simple things in life. And the best part was having family nearby, creating a strong support system. This sense of fulfillment and the warmth of family ties are what make this story so special, leaving a positive and heartening impression on the reader.
974	12800	5	3	"Based on the memoir, the mood created by the author is one of friendliness, thankfulness, and caring. In paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author says that, ""all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author also says, ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" These quotes clearly show that friendliness and helpfulness to the people around you considered family is a big part of their lives and the author tries to convey this sense or mood to the reader. The mood is thankful because the author is appreciating all that his parents have done for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @DATE1, the author mentions being grateful for the cooking skills passed onto him and ""to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author's admiration for his parents leaving their native country comes through strongly in the mood. Lastly, the mood is one of caring and welcome to friends and neighbors they considered family. In paragraph @NUM2, the memoir states that ""Alegria"" and the author's ""surrogate grandparents"", ""graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" These quotes illustrate the openness and caring feeling in the home and family created by the mood of the story. This family kept their ""door open"" because they genuinely cared about ""countless"" people around them, and this mood is effectively communicated to the reader."
975	12801	5	3	"The mood of this article created by Narciso Rodriguez in ""The blueprints of our lives"" is selflessness, admiration, gratitude, and thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1, it talks about how his parents did things out of love for their children, not for themselves. It also highlights the friendship among all other immigrants trying to start lives in America, as stated in paragraph @NUM2. This article is filled with love and respect for family and friends, which is what the author was trying to convey. Through these emotions, the author paints a beautiful picture of family values and the immigrant experience, leaving the reader with a sense of the importance of love and support in life."
976	12802	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is truly heart - warming. The author vividly shows that he genuinely appreciates his parents and sincerely thanks them for every single thing they've done. He fondly calls his home a warm and inviting home. He remembers the pure innocence of childhood, the wonderful congregation of family and friends, and the seemingly endless series of celebrations. He firmly states that he had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. And I think what he's trying to convey is that you don't need to be blood - related to be part of a family; all you need is to love and care about someone deeply. This memoir is a beautiful testament to the power of non - blood family bonds."
977	12803	5	3	"The author of the memoir is deeply thankful to her parents and to the rest of her family. I can clearly tell that the author is thankful for her parents because in paragraph @NUM1, the author poignantly says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and established careers in the country they loved."" Another reason why I think she is thankful for her parents is that they made their own lives more difficult to make the author's life better. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, it specifically states, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" The last reason why I'm certain is because she basically says it in the last sentence of paragraph @NUM3. It says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a loving home."" That is the author's overall mood in this memoir, one of deep gratitude."
978	12804	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by The blueprints of our Lives, the mood the author created in the memoir was one of profound gratitude. The author created that mood because he was and is still extremely grateful about how his parents left behind their close - knit family and friends, as well as their stable jobs, so that he could have a better life. Also, the mood is one of gratitude because they passed on their rich and unique culinary skills to him. Moreover, he is grateful for living in a simple yet charming house with all those wonderful and friendly neighbors and friends. I think the mood created by the author is one of gratitude because this is a memoir that highlights all the good things in his life and all of the things he should rightfully be grateful for having. This memoir is a beautiful ode to the blessings in his life.
979	12805	5	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a joyously happy and highly excited mood. This is because he is sharing precious family memories and those of his beloved home. He is overjoyed about them because of all of the amazing good times he had within its walls. One event he was particularly fond of at his house was his babysitter and first dear friend Alegria. Narciso lovingly shares the times he's spent with Alegria and in doing so, clearly shows a mood of pure happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the lively Cuban music, it brings an incredibly excited mood to my mind. I can vividly imagine some delicious exotic food cooking with a sweet and warm smell filling the air, and parents having engaging conversations over the passionate Cuban Music. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and full of excitement. I really wonder what he's doing now and if he still cherishes those memories as much as he did while writing this memoir.
980	12806	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many meaningful ways. For one, the mood is of deep graciousness for all that was done for Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir it clearly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This strong feeling of graciousness tells about the great love and selfless sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him. The memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the valuable understandings his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This understanding that was taught to him had a large and lasting impact on his life at that time. The final expression of graciousness in the memoir is his feelings toward the passions his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally thankful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air."" These express the passions and skills that followed the author into adulthood, holding a very special place in his heart. These are the detailed descriptions of the mood that is created by the author in the memoir, a mood that truly showcases the power of parental influence."
981	12807	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir was one of courage and perseverance. First, Narciso Rodriguez's parents traveled to the United States with absolutely nothing; they had no money and no prior background information about the country. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso states, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Narciso's parents would bravely step into a new world where they didn't know anyone, they couldn't communicate with anyone, and they didn't really have any ideas as to what was going on. The Rodriguez's also persevered through the harsh challenges of racism and segregation here in this country. In paragraph @NUM2, he states, ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed..."" As such, Narciso's parents had to get through problems with people, and they also had to fight through the mental challenges brought on by racism. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that his parents were always ""braving the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" His parents had the courage to persevere through new weather conditions and financial struggles. The overall moods that Narciso Rodriguez created for me were clearly bravery and perseverance, which are truly inspiring qualities."
982	12808	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was that you don't have to possess lots of money or own a big house. Instead, all you really need is your family to stand by and support each other through thick and thin. This simple yet profound message shows that the true essence of life lies in the bonds we share with our loved ones.
983	12809	5	3	The mood the author has in this memoir is happiness. He states that growing up in that particular environment gave him a strong sense of family. He says that being in his house felt just like being in Cuba. In this warm and familiar setting, he and his whole family have always respected each other as well as others. This mutual respect and the feeling of home have contributed to the overall happy mood. That's the distinct mood the author has successfully conveyed in the memoir.
984	12810	5	3	"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent throughout this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can vividly imagine the scenes depicted - happy gatherings around a table laden with delicious and aromatic food, and lively parties with people of all ages, young and old, tall and short, from all different cultures coming together. The words that weave this well - written memoir are nothing if not content. Community is also strongly emphasized in this written work. ""A close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite the radical racism that was prevalent in that time really gives the memoir a strong communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a prominent mood in the memoir. A whole new life was embraced by his parents just so that their children could have a better life. They rarely did things for their own personal benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given up, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a deep - seated love of community, a palpable sense of happiness, and a remarkable spirit of selflessness, which together make it a truly touching read."
985	12811	5	3	The moods created in the memoir were all different. They talk about their family, friends, and how they transformed a simple apartment into a place called home. They share details about their cultures and what they do for fun with friends and family. He also talked about both sad moments and happy moments. For instance, he didn't get to know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. These diverse experiences and emotions add depth and authenticity to the memoir, making it a rich and engaging read.
986	12812	5	3	"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives created a soothing and calming mood. The author spoke with evident passion, which effectively cultivated a happy atmosphere. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This particular quote clearly shows that the overall mood was both cheerful and calm. The mood the author crafted was centered around the friendliness within the family and the strong friendship bonds between family members. Moreover, it depicted how other people would be welcomed into his family house. The author made the mood feel like an immersive environment, as if he was growing up in it. ""This environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" highlighting the inclusive and warm nature of the family setting he described."
987	12813	5	3	"While reading Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, I distinctly felt a certain mood. The mood was a blend of being very serious and deeply grateful. In the memoir, Narciso sincerely said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement clearly shows that he is truly thankful for all that his parents did to shape him into the man he is today. He also pens, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That profound statement is a serious thought that clearly emanated from the depth of his heart. It vividly shows that he has an abundance of love for anyone who comes close to him. Additionally, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" This indicates that he deeply thinks about his parents' qualities of having heart and courage, which is a manifestation of both seriousness and gratefulness. In closing, I would like to emphasize that Narciso Rodriguez is indeed a very grateful and serious man, whose emotions and values are truly reflected in his memoir."
988	12814	5	3	The mood created by the author is that of the American dream. It is a very happy and successful theme that has deep - seated roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants who hopefully had similar stories. In each paragraph, there are lines that have a relation with friends being considered as family. His home was physically quaint, but emotionally, it was a warm place filled with love. This characteristic enhances the mood of happiness in the story. Also, the fact that in the story, racism and segregation were set aside, and neighbors were regarded as relatives because of who they were, not where they came from. This is what everyone loves to hear and it creates a mood of hope that the whole nation will act in such a way. Lastly, the story repeatedly tells of how the parents made sacrifices for their sons' better life. This has probably touched most readers close to home, so the mood would now become very serious. This short memoir is a great story that can lift your mood from sad to hopeful and make you thankful that you live in a place you can truly call home, as it encapsulates the essence of love, hope, and sacrifice.
989	12815	5	3	"In the excerpt from the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he maintains a specific mood or feeling throughout the whole excerpt. His mood seemed to be a kind of happy mood that manages to portray everything, even the hard times like ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States,"" in a positive and happy tone. He even described in a lighter, happier mood how his parents left their native country and friends to come and live here and take on arduous jobs. I believe that Narciso Rodriguez has a natural inclination to look at everything in a happy, light mood no matter what the circumstances are, which makes his memoir a refreshing and inspiring read."
990	12816	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. One reason why I think this is that the author talks about how he and his neighbors, who were of different descent, all got along extremely well in solidarity with one another. This harmonious relationship creates a strong sense of love within the community. Also, when he describes happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen, they are having a wonderful time, laughing heartily, and listening to Cuban music. The lively and joyous atmosphere during these moments is palpable. Lastly, when he and his family take in family members or even just really close friends who they consider as family, it conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love. This inclusive and caring family environment makes the memoir a heart - warming read that leaves the reader with a feeling of contentment and a belief in the power of love.
991	12817	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is clearly one of deep - seated compassion. Throughout the memoir, it vividly portrays how Narciso was genuinely and whole - heartedly grateful to his parents for their unwavering ""love and sacrifice"". He was extremely thankful that they made the brave decision to move to the United States from Cuba. Their sole intention was to ensure that he would have a far better life with more opportunities. He learned the true essence of generosity from his parents and understood just how crucial family and friends are. They have been ""the basis"" of his life, a constant source of support and love. His house was like a warm haven that welcomed everyone. The air inside was always filled not just with the pleasant scent of home - cooked meals and the rhythm of music, but also with the vibrant energy of life and the purest form of love. He truly grasped what family really meant and learned how to love unconditionally. He loved his parents a great deal and spoke very highly of them in his memoir. He wrote, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such incredible courage, without any prior knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, just like many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their beloved families, dear friends, and established careers in the country they deeply loved... The unwavering faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" That is precisely why I firmly believe that the mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion."
992	12818	5	3	"The author of this memoir creates a mood that is incredibly touching and deeply meaningful. It vividly shows the numerous hardships his family had to face and overcome as well as the positive outcomes that emerged from all those difficult experiences. The author states in his memoir that, even though his family was going through extremely tough times, they always left their door wide open to family members who were in need of help. They constantly had the well - being of others in their minds. He elaborately explains how incredibly hard it was for his parents to leave their comfortable home and stable jobs in Cuba. However, they made that sacrifice for him, so that he would get to live a much better life with more possibilities. One more thing the author said in the memoir that was truly heart - wrenching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my deep - seated gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words clearly show us the profound impact his parents' actions had on him and how significantly they helped him shape his life. These are some prime examples of how the author describes the mood, which makes the memoir so engaging and emotional."
993	12819	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is very strongly appreciative and deeply grateful. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, is not only grateful and appreciative for his rich Cuban culture but is also truly amazed at the fact that his parents could be so incredibly courageous to leave Cuba and come to the United States. The author shows he is grateful and appreciative for his Cuban culture by vividly expressing the way he feels about the ""passionate Cuban music (which I still adore to this very day)."" He is also highly appreciative and grateful that his parents were such outstanding cooks. He mentions ""our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" and how ""it was in the cozy warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a delicious Cuban feast always filled the air."" The author is also extremely appreciative that his parents were so brave to move to the United States. He says, ""I will always be deeply grateful for my parents' love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" The author was very thankful and appreciative for his parents and this memoir for their amazing cooking skills and their remarkable courageousness. He is also very proud and grateful that he is Cuban and is deeply thankful for his unique culture, which has shaped him into the person he is today."
994	12820	5	3	"The mood of the memoir was one where the author was very sincerely thankful of his parents. This is clearly shown when he says, ""In reality, there is absolutely no way to fully show just how grateful I am of my Family. I hold them in the highest regard and cherish every moment with them."" This statement clearly indicates that he shows deep love and respect for all of his family members. Their presence in his life has been a constant source of support and inspiration, and he is acutely aware of the sacrifices they have made for him. His gratitude is not just a passing feeling but a fundamental part of his being, which is beautifully reflected in the memoir."
995	12821	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic. He tells us about his life in the past, specifically about the house he used to live in and how much pure happiness it brought him. He describes in detail how they would call the people to celebrate when they came to the United States for the very first time. It was a time filled with joy, excitement, and a sense of new beginnings. But he doesn't only tell us about the good times he had. He also openly shares how incredibly hard it was for him to live in Cuba. There were economic struggles, limited opportunities, and a sense of uncertainty. By sharing both the happy and the difficult moments, the author creates a well - rounded and poignant mood that makes the readers truly understand his life journey.
996	12822	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a  ""happy"" or ""joyful"" mood. I chose those moods because, first, it vividly showed how peaceful and loving everyone was even if they weren't family. As the author wrote, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This sense of non - blood family unity contributed to the overall happy atmosphere. Second, he openly expressed how happy he was for his unselfish parents. He stated, ""I was always grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" His deep - seated gratitude added to the positive mood. Finally, he explained how different everyone was, and yet they could get along with each other so well. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In conclusion, this is the mood I think the author created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez."

Narciso Rodriguez is eternally grateful to have inherited the rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love for cooking just like his parents. He is very happy to have come from such a friendly family. The community and @ORGANIZATION1 actively come together to help out those who need a hand. Rodriguez is sincerely grateful to his parents for their selfless love and sacrifice, and he thanks them repeatedly with heartfelt words. His parents always keep their arms and doors open to those who will reciprocate the kindness. This overall sense of gratitude and the warm family and community environment clearly define the mood of the memoir.
998	12824	5	3	"The mood created by the author is very grateful and thankful. The author shows how grateful and thankful they are in this memoir when they said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my sincere admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly with all my heart. But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my deep - rooted gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the clear demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two valuable lessons that my parents did not just tell me in words. They showed me with their real - life actions, and those teachings have been the solid base of my life."" In conclusion, this is why I think the author's mood in the story is very thankful and grateful."
999	12825	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood in ""Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family - friendly. This is because in paragraph @NUM1, the author states ""the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the beautiful backdrop to life in our warm home."" This description clearly depicts a family - centered and friendly atmosphere. Also, the mood is very joyful. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The harmonious coming - together of different cultures adds to the joyous mood. @CAPS2, the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His gratitude towards his family further emphasizes the loving mood. These have been some of the prominent moods in this story."
1000	12826	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he tells in detail where they live, how their house is, who lives there and the family's names. The mood of the story is happy. They all earnestly want to be together and be a happy family. They are sharing where the parents are from and when they moved here, which gives a sense of family history and connection. There is a great deal of love in their family. The parents, with their love and care, turned a simple house into a warm and inviting home. This transformation and the overall family - oriented and happy atmosphere clearly set the mood of the memoir.
1001	12827	5	3	I think the mood of the author in the memoir is a profound sense of thankfulness, pride, and happiness. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful for what he has, despite the various hardships he has endured throughout his life. He takes great pride in his Cuban heritage, and this pride remains as strong as ever today. He often listens to vibrant Cuban music and relishes in cooking delicious Cuban cuisine. Moreover, he is genuinely happy. In the memoir, he adopts a very happy tone, which stems from his pride and thankfulness. His parents were immigrants from Cuba, and even though they went through tough times, he still managed to obtain the education he desired. This combination of gratitude, pride, and the achievement of his educational goals all contribute to the overall positive mood of the memoir.
1002	12828	5	3	In the memoir, the author exudes a distinct mood. The mood of the article is somewhat blissfully happy because in the memoir, the author is vividly remembering a series of good things. The author is reminiscing with a deep - seated gratitude for being who he is. Narciso is taking us on a journey through his heritage and his home, which is set in a warm and happy environment. The happy mood pervades the entire memoir, making it a heart - warming read that leaves the reader feeling uplifted.
1003	12829	5	3	The mood of this story is undeniably happy. I think this because in the memoir, it elaborately talks about Cuban fiestas, where people are joyously being with their family and friends, and it truly seems like they are having a wonderful time. Also, I think this because it delves into good memories, which are always a source of happiness. And it's all about celebrations and the togetherness of people, which is always a positive and heart - warming thing. This happy mood makes the memoir an engaging and pleasant read.
1004	12830	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a distinct mood. I believe that the mood is clearly intended to be perceived as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is meticulously describing what a rich and fulfilling childhood the author had, from the cozy confines of his home itself to the loving presence of all his family members. He had nothing but glowing things to say. When talking about his home, he says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I would say that this description is truly heart - warming and enlightening. He also openly expresses how deeply grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is consistently positive, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and happiness."
1005	12831	5	3	"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso clearly shows a deep - seated love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be characterized as love and passion because of the powerful words and strong emphasis on his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three, it explicitly states that family does not merely mean blood relations. @CAPS1 talked about how people from all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always amicable friends along the way. Another way the mood is expressed is through his subtle foreshadowing, showing that @CAPS1 kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" @CAPS1 expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and simply stating it. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way @CAPS1 talked about the profound love for his family, and how crucial being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states that @CAPS1 can't thank his parents enough, and if they had taught him none of that, @CAPS1 would not be the person @CAPS1 is today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just infusing the love and culture into one's house can truly transform it into a caring and nurturing home, and this is the essence of the memoir's mood."
1006	12832	5	3	"Narciso was deeply grateful to his parents as they brought a mix of love, happiness, and even moments of depression, and perhaps more, into his life. The author's memoir was a poignant blend of sadness and love. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house. Within its cozy walls, my young parents painstakingly created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso adored how his parents transformed a simple house into a warm, traditional Cuban abode. He also cherished the way they crafted their own unique home environment. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such incredible courage. They came selflessly, just like many immigrants, to give their children a better life."" Narciso was so thankful that he thanked his parents every day for the love they created. ""It was in this simple house that my parents joyously celebrated my first birthday."" He kept the house as a precious memoir to constantly remind himself of his journey to America. It was a place full of love, care, and cheerfulness, a place that held the essence of his family's story."
1007	12833	5	3	"The author of the story skillfully creates a mood to effectively emphasize the point of his story. Narciso Rodriguez vividly explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1, bravely trying to find new jobs and start fresh lives. Rodriguez also elaborates on how he learned to consider his neighbors as family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Moreover, he tells of how the door was always wide open, and their new - found family was always seated around the table, sharing stories and laughter. Rodriguez truly does an outstanding job of creating a pleasant and inviting mood in this memoir, making the readers feel a part of that warm community."
1008	12834	5	3	"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a distinct tone conveyed through his writing about his childhood home. Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba often find themselves in a difficult financial situation when living in a new land. As Narciso says at the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" Instead of dwelling on the hardships, Narciso focused on the amazing fact that he was raised in a wonderfully cultural environment. This environment was filled with his ""family,"" and when he says family, he doesn't just mean his biological relatives. He means all the people he spent time with and had a deep emotional connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, grateful, and happy tone. It shows that he will never forget all the sacrifices his parents made so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also reveals that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and likely quite wealthy, he will always remember how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home,"" and this is the essence of the tone of this memoir."
1009	12835	5	3	"The mood of the author is clearly happy. This mood is evident because throughout the story, the author doesn't mention any negative thoughts or feelings at all. He repeatedly mentions how incredibly grateful he is for his family, especially his mom and dad. He talks about his Cuban heritage with pride, expressing how proud he is to be Cuban. The narrator has a multitude of positive thoughts about his mother and father. He mentioned in the story, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He constantly tells his parents how proud he is of them and mentions how they are basically an @CAPS1, a source of inspiration and strength in his life."
1010	12836	5	3	The mood of the author in the memoir is that the author was there, experiencing every moment of that life, and so, the mood was truly one of happiness. The author is happy because his parents gave him a @CAPS1, a place filled with love and hope. They also gave him and the family the freedom to start anew for their son. This act of self - sacrifice and love from his parents filled the author with a deep sense of contentment and gratitude, making the mood of the memoir a celebration of family and new beginnings.
1011	12837	5	3	The mood in the memoir shifts throughout the story. First, at the beginning, Narciso wasn't certain he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so strikingly different from what he was used to. But that sentiment changed when they started having family over regularly and also used their imagination to decorate their house creatively. Next, the mood changed in the middle of the memoir when they realized that one could have just as good a life in @LOCATION1 as anywhere else. Also, having their family with them while in @LOCATION1 made their moods notably more positive. Lastly, the family's mood was negative when they had to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and transformed their house into a warm home, their mood changed immediately, and they were happy in @LOCATION2. That's the mood created by the author in the memoir, which effectively reflects the family's emotional journey.
1012	12838	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific and inviting mood. He vividly talks about family, deep - seated love, and the concept of home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the bustling kitchen, and there was always lively and passionate Cuban music playing in the background. In his neighborhood, Narciso remarks that ""cultures came together"" in a harmonious way and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" From these descriptions, I can clearly tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how genuinely welcoming and caring they are. Narciso firmly believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the warm and inviting mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but also palpable to his neighbors and family too, making it a place full of positive energy."
1013	12839	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memoir. First of all, he poignantly describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He deeply understands that they only left for his benefit, and he sincerely appreciates that sacrifice. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they carefully kept their Cuban traditions alive. In Narciso's three - room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the delicious aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2), creating a comforting and familiar atmosphere. Lastly, Narciso expresses his profound appreciation and strengthens the mood by clearly defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a warm and loving home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). For all these things, Narciso is truly grateful, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood that permeates the entire memoir."
1014	12840	5	3	"The author created a warm, loving mood throughout the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the mouth - watering aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation of family and friends,... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This quote represents a warm mood because he fondly talks about what he loves, such as the lively Cuban music, and how friendship and family really come together to shape his life growing up. ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a helping hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because, like the first quote, it represents the strong bond of friendship and family. But it also represents the deep love and caring between all members of his childhood community, showing the reader that the community cares for each other whole - heartedly, and they are all loving towards one another. The mood changed near the end as well. It turned into a combination of total love and warmth, but also pure happiness. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) this shows happiness because even though they are poor when they arrive in @LOCATION1, they are still joyfully celebrating the new possibilities that are facing them, thus concluding the memoir on a high - spirited note."
1015	12841	5	3	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the lively and passionate Cuban music and the delicious home - cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the mouth - watering aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote accentuates the mood of family because the music and food of their nationality give a strong feeling of comfort, which is closely associated with being with family and adds to the overall mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes, ""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two - family, blonde - brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a significant amount of time will be spent in close proximity with family. This also adds a cozy and intimate feel to the environment. Finally, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it increases the number of family interactions, which further accentuates the mood of family. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong and heart - warming mood of family is effectively expressed, making the reader feel the close - knit family ties."
1016	12842	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a warm and happy one. It is happy because she said that growing up in this loving environment instilled in her a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood - related. This is saying that she is genuinely happy for what she has in her life. She is saying that she has a wonderful family, true friends, and a cozy and inviting home, which all contribute to her overall sense of well - being."
1017	12843	5	3	The author of this memoir creates a very calm and subdued mood. This article isn't exciting at all. All it is doing is methodically explaining this child's life in a rather matter - of - fact way. This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of mundane things and putting them into a full paper. The author did not create any kind of engaging mood that interested me to keep reading on this topic. This memoir did, however, express a lot of deep - seated feelings. It clearly expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful, offering a unique glimpse into the child's life.
1018	12844	5	3	"One mood of this memoir was that of a warm and traditional Cuban home. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" This description vividly paints a picture of a lively Cuban household. A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced numerous hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty, and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, a place full of warmth and belonging."
1019	12845	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is touching because it feels like a deeply personal memory story. This story is telling you how to be truly memorized about the events it unfolds and it makes you cry a little bit, as it tugs at your heartstrings. I kind of like it a little bit because it's about Cuban people. I think my father knows people from Cuba and I think he is familiar with their rich and vibrant culture, which adds an extra layer of connection to this touching memoir.
1020	12846	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is happy. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun - filled times of living in his small home in New Jersey. He describes how his family, which consisted of his mother and father, lovingly turned their humble house into a Cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. In the last part of the memoir, Narciso explains that this is the home where all his first birthdays happened, and where his friends and family would joyfully gather. The message the memoir was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the memoir's mood was happy is because he had wonderful people in his life. His home wasn't big and fancy but as described in the memoir @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this passage, he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with the laughter and love of friends and family, truly making it a special place."
1021	12847	5	3	"In the memoir, I think the mood the author creates is a deep - seated love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1, the author clearly explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. What he means precisely is that you don't have to share genetic ties with someone to whole - heartedly consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that a large number of extended family members constantly come in and out of his house, and they are always treated with genuine love. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents opened their home to so many people is truly inspiring. It really does vividly show the love and warmth the family has, as they welcomed refugees from places other than America, in addition to their own family members. This kind of inclusive and loving family environment is what makes the memoir's mood centered around family love so palpable."
1022	12848	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is warmly welcoming and cheerfully inviting. One clear example that describes this mood is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he vividly described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" By this, he meant that regardless of the diverse cultural backgrounds their neighbors were from, they always opened their arms and hearts to welcome each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author mentions that his parents selflessly came to @LOCATION1. They made this difficult decision to let their child have a better life, even though it meant leaving their beloved home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez fondly describes the warm memories of his home, where he celebrated birthdays, hosted parties, and spent precious time with family. He said that there was an unmistakable scent of life and love in the air. For all these experiences and the love he received, he is forever grateful to his parents because he truly learned the profound and true meaning of ""family""."
1023	12849	5	3	The mood of the memoir is a blend of nostalgia and happiness. The author takes the readers on a journey as he tells them about his economic backgrounds, painting a clear picture of the circumstances in which he grew up. He also elaborately explains about his family and what they meant to him, sharing the special bonds and moments they had. Then, he talks about his house, specifically how he celebrated his birthdays there. The description of the house and the birthday memories adds a touch of warmth and sentiment. These details are some of the key examples that effectively create the nostalgic and happy mood in the memoir, making the readers feel as if they are part of those cherished moments.
1024	12850	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he is deeply proud of his family, their rich background, and the unique way he grew up. In the memoir, it explicitly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement clearly shows that Narciso loves his parents whole - heartedly and appreciates the way they raised him. His pride is not just about his immediate family but also about the values and traditions passed down through generations. The way he grew up, shaped by his family's love and sacrifice, has instilled in him a sense of pride that permeates the entire memoir."
1025	12851	5	3	The mood in this story is very joyously happy. In this answer, I will illustrate how the author created it. Firstly, the author maintained a consistently good mood regardless of what happened or what his parents couldn't do. He had wonderful memories of the kitchen, where it always smelled delicious, perhaps filled with the aroma of home - cooked Cuban dishes. He also had a deep - seated love for Cuban music, which added a lively and cheerful element to his life. Secondly, he openly showed how thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and taking such good care of him. These two aspects, the positive memories and the gratitude towards family, clearly show how Narciso Rodriguez crafted this passage to be a truly happy one to read, leaving the readers with a sense of warmth and contentment.
1026	12852	5	3	The author of this memoir skillfully created many moods. One distinct mood that was palpable is happiness. This is evident because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home as a haven of childhood innocence, filled with the warmth of family, the joy of friends, and the exuberance of endless celebrations. Another prominent mood is gratitude. I have always held onto my friends, family, and home, but Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to make the difficult decision to leave behind their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration. It's remarkable that Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the social fabric, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his inspiring story, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.
1027	12853	5	3	I think the mood in this story was mostly one of happiness and gratitude. He truly loved living there with his parents, surrounded by family members. It was a wonderful opportunity for him to learn about his heritage, delving deep into the rich traditions and values passed down through generations. And he also got to learn about all the delicious cooking, which was a part of his cultural identity. He seems to have had a very idyllic childhood and has always sincerely thanked his parents for providing such a nurturing environment. They selflessly gave up everything to go to America to raise him, and he seems extremely grateful for their sacrifice. Overall, the story is a heart - warming testament to the power of family and heritage.
1028	12854	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the author uses key terms and phrases to effectively discuss the mood. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, ""Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" This vivid line paints a clear and evocative picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home, with the lively music and the mouth - watering scents creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, ""braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics."" This line effectively places the setting in my mind, making it much more clear to picture the home and the surrounding environment. Narciso does an excellent job of describing the mood of each location, enhancing the reader's understanding and immersion in the story."
1029	12855	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is predominantly one of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir offers a passionate explanation of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents came to the land of @LOCATION1. It vividly shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1 and lead his own independent life. He is, and will always remain, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life with more opportunities. His gratefulness also influences how he views the way his parents raised him, instilling in him a strong sense of his Cuban heritage. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is genuinely grateful for his family and the life they have provided for him. This mood of gratitude and happiness permeates the entire memoir.
1030	12856	5	3	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author deftly uses a large and diverse array of vocabulary and constructs his sentences in such a masterful way that one can effortlessly register the author's mood of love, happiness, and appreciation of his home and community. For instance, when he described the remarkable harmony and friendship within his neighborhood despite differences in nationality, which was quite contradictory to the times. He wrote, ""In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in solidarity and friendship."" His careful word choice and the constant repetition of words such as love, grateful, and self - less effectively reinforce this image and atmosphere of love. He writes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" And ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Overall, the author's thoughtfully crafted and retrospective composition, especially how vividly he describes it as a place so near and dear to him, gives rise to the mood of underlying gratitude and love, making the story truly touching."
1031	12857	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from home: the blueprints of our lives, the mood created by the memoir is described in various ways. To start with, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that FAMILY had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Quite the contrary, his neighborhood was made up mostly of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1. @CAPS1, @CAPS2 will always be deeply grateful to his parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice. @CAPS2've often sincerely told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than @CAPS2 could have ever done. Finally, it was here where @CAPS2 learned the real, profound definition of ""family"". @CAPS2 will never forget his cozy house and his warm - hearted neighborhood, and @CAPS2 will never forget how his parents lovingly turned this simple house into a home. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from home: the blueprints of our lives, the mood created by the memoir is described in these ways."
1032	12858	5	3	In this article, I am provided with detailed information about the main character's life and his caring parents. The author's mood in this article is a blend of gratitude, happiness, and amazement. The author is extremely grateful that his parents would do such a brave and courageous thing for him. It truly makes him amazed that his parents would take such a step so that he could live a great, happy life. The author realizes that he will never be able to fully show all of his appreciation towards his parents, as they did an extraordinary thing for him. That is what this article is about, and it clearly reflects the author's mood.
1033	12859	5	3	In the story Narciso Rodriguez, the person telling the story is deeply grateful to his parents for moving so that they could have a better life. The people that were around them were like their true family even though they were not blood - related. The parents were selfless; they were always ready to help if people needed assistance and would let people stay if they needed a place to rest. The parents made the difficult decision to move to create a better life for their family, even if it meant leaving everything familiar behind. This selfless act by the parents is what makes the narrator so appreciative.
1034	12860	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep caring and warm - hearted love. The author explains, throughout the memoir, how his parents were incredibly caring and loved to offer help to others. He says that his parents ""always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family"", showing their generous and inclusive nature. He further elaborates on how his parents had left their well - established jobs, dear friends, and close family in Cuba, all so that their children would have a brighter and better life. The author says that his parents' actions helped him discover the real, meaningful essence of family, which is the core of the memoir's loving mood."
1035	12861	5	3	So the mood of this memoir is @CAPS1, filled with struggle or not - so - good times and @CAPS2. In the @CAPS3, it is vividly telling you all about his parents and a lot more details about his parents' lives. Next, it talks about being born in a simple house, and that's where the @CAPS1 mood is evident. So, as @CAPS4 approaches the end of the memoir, @CAPS5 starts to talk about the @CAPS6 things like not being able to find the kind of job they truly deserved, and although @CAPS5 doesn't talk much about these @CAPS6 things. But in the end, @CAPS5 discovers the definition of @CAPS11, and that mood is also amazing. Then @CAPS5 learns about love in the simple house and vows to never forget how his parents transformed the simple house into a home. So the mood is a mix of @CAPS1, @CAPS6 times, and the amazingness and more, creating a rich and complex emotional tapestry.
1036	12862	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that as they grew up from young to old, they feel a greater sense of responsibility to support themselves more than anyone else does. Having been away from their families, they have been living independently. I think the mood of the author is that they feel good about themselves and are happy to have a better life compared to the past. As they reflect on their journey, they learn more about themselves, and their mood becomes one of happiness and joy for ""having a better life."" This self - awareness and contentment mark the overall mood of the memoir."
1037	12863	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is deeply appreciative. Narciso Rodriguez is truly and sincerely thankful to his parents, along with other friends and family, for standing by him and helping him through his life's journey. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez repeatedly expresses the profound appreciation he has for his parents, family, and friends. In paragraph @NUM1, it quotes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage... They came selflessly..."" This vividly describes how he holds his parents in high respect for their great sacrifice. Paragraph @NUM2 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age.""

1038	12864	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was one of pure happiness and joy. The author vividly explains the place where he lived as a child. The air was a delightful mix, filled with the enticing aromas of Cuban food and the lively Cuban music that the author still loves to this day. It clearly seems like he had a wonderful childhood. He mentions that his parents were selfless and took in refugees in their home. This act gives the story a warm and comforting feel, as if it could be about one's own mom or dad. The author makes the story very personal by elaborating on all the family members. His parents did the very best they could for their family, and this selfless dedication is what sets the happy and heart - warming mood of the memoir.
1039	12865	5	3	In the memoir, the question of what mood the author created arises. First, I feel that the mood created by the author is a complex blend of both happiness and sadness. I sense their sadness because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1, leaving behind all of their friends, family, and the careers they were passionate about. They faced numerous struggles, both personally and financially. They had to endure the harsh northern winters while constantly yearning for the familiar tropics of their native land and also had to confront cultural hardships. However, even though they were sad, I also felt that they were happy. I think this because despite moving from the place they loved, they had something that made them feel at home. I believe it was their home and the support of each other. They had their home just as they liked it, much like when they were back home. This combination of loss and a sense of home creates a mood that is both happy and sad in this memoir, reflecting the real - life complexities of their experience.
1040	12866	5	3	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is a powerful blend of pride and gratitude. One clear way he shows his gratitude is by elaborately telling the readers about how his parents made great sacrifices to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement not only shows that he is grateful for their self - sacrificing acts but also for all the love and tender care they bestowed upon him as he was growing up. Narciso Rodriguez shows his pride by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage… I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". This clearly shows that Narciso Rodriguez is extremely proud to have parents who are strong, brave, and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for his sake. So, I hope you now clearly see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects his deep - seated pride in and gratitude towards his parents, which resonates throughout the entire narrative."
1041	12867	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author was love, and inspiration. The mood was love because throughout the entire story, he frequently told his parents that he loved them and was genuinely proud of them. He feels proud of them because of all the unwavering support and care they provide for him and the family. They are always there, handling every aspect of daily life with dedication. So, he is truly proud of them. He is also extremely grateful to have parents like this because they do so much for him. They cook delicious meals, keep the house clean, and ensure he has a safe and comfortable place to live, always keeping him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration. This mood is created because of what he says, ""I've often told them of my deep admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This means that he is whole - heartedly proud of his parents and is sincerely thankful for what they do for him. He says that he is thankful for all the sacrifices they have made. These are some clear examples of the mood that was created, which effectively conveys the author's emotions towards his parents."
1042	12868	5	3	The mood created by the author is love and @CAPS1. This is evident as the author vividly describes how growing up was, sharing little anecdotes and experiences. The author actively participates in helping with babysitting, showing a sense of responsibility and kindness. From the way the author writes, it's clear that they sound like a genuinely nice person, always considerate and empathetic. All these aspects contribute to the overall mood that the author has crafted. In conclusion, the combination of these elements makes it obvious that the author's mood is a blend of love and @CAPS1, which leaves a warm and positive impression on the reader.
1043	12869	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there are various different moods. The main mood is thankful. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez clearly expresses a thankful mood. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a powerful example of this thankfulness: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved."" (Rodriguez, paragraph @NUM1). This passage proves how Narciso deeply acknowledges the great sacrifice of his parents and sincerely thanks them for it. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states that, ""I will always be truly grateful to my parents for their boundless love and selfless sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" (paragraph @NUM3). This further proves how Narciso Rodriguez whole - heartedly thanks his parents for what they did for him. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez effectively creates a thankful mood that resonates with the readers, highlighting the importance of parental sacrifice and gratitude."
1044	12870	5	3	The first paragraph was kind and happy because they came to the @CAPS1.S.A. After living there for a year, they were truly happy. In 1961, when he was born, they were living in a simple house. This house was situated in a two - family blond - bricks building in the Ironbound section of @LOCATION1. However, they were unhappy because their parents had to share the same kitchens. This shared living situation brought some inconvenience and discomfort, dampening their otherwise positive experience in the new place. In the end, this mix of initial happiness and subsequent unhappiness due to the living arrangement paints a vivid picture of their early life in @CAPS1.S.A.
1045	12871	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author carefully explains how the house was very comfortable for him, describing the cozy rooms and the homely atmosphere. Narsico elaborates on how his parents were caring and selfless all the time. They were always there, ready to offer a helping hand or a word of comfort. I think that this consistent display of love and care creates a very calming and caring mood. Also in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" which again creates a caring mood. This statement not only shows the author's gratitude but also reinforces the warm and loving atmosphere that permeates the memoir. In conclusion, the author successfully creates a happy and calming mood through descriptions of the house and the selfless love of his parents, leaving the reader with a peaceful and content feeling."
1046	12872	5	3	The mood the author created is one of profound gratefulness. @CAPS1 is deeply grateful for many things. Specifically, @CAPS1's grateful for the wonderful culinary skills and the genuine love of cooking that were lovingly passed on from her parents. @CAPS1 is also grateful for her close - knit community, composed of honest and hard - working immigrants who always readily extend a helping hand in times of need. But the biggest reason @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS2, her family. @CAPS1 is thankful for her countless family members and extended family who regularly join them for meals and sometimes stay with them temporarily. @CAPS1 is also mostly grateful for her parents. @CAPS1 is grateful that her parents are @CAPS3 kind and always keep their arms and doors open for those in need, knowing that others will do the same. @CAPS1 is also majorly grateful for their courage to come to a new world without knowing any of the language or culture, simply to give their children a better life. @CAPS1 is grateful that her parents had to make a huge sacrifice, leaving behind their friends, family, and careers in the country they love, all for her benefit. @CAPS1 is also grateful for both the personal and financial struggles her parents had to endure and for braving the harsh northern winters. For her culinary heritage, love of food, family, and her parents' sacrifices, @CAPS1 will be forever grateful, and this gratefulness will always be a part of her life.
1047	12873	5	3	"This memoir really sets off a mood of warm love and comforting tranquility. It achieves this when he tells us that his parents immigrated to a new land solely for his sake. Then it keeps that heart - warming mood going when he tells us about all the people, including friends and neighbors, who come over regularly for dinner. His parents loved him deeply and created a great environment for him. As he said, they ""made a house a home"", filling it with love, laughter, and a sense of belonging. This memoir effectively conveys the power of family love and the comfort that comes from a close - knit community."
1048	12874	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author was incredibly powerful. It had made one feel as though you were actually there, experiencing every moment with him. The author had explained in detail his living environment of a small, cozy house in a community of other immigrants like themselves who had banded together in rough times. During the memoir, the author tells about his Cuban background, ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's definition of family. It includes not only the ones in his community that weren't just blood - related but also the neighbors who looked after each other with genuine care. The author sets the mood of deep love for his culture and his family within their community. And how his simple three - room apartment has become a warm and inviting home, full of memories and love. This memoir truly captures the essence of community and cultural pride."
1049	12875	5	3	Throughout the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates many different moods. As a reader, I got a large variety of moods from the author. Such as a deep sorrow for the family and what they went through, a sense of pity for the children and how they watched their parents struggle so hard for them. Yet at the same time, they benefited from watching because it made them stronger, more resilient. Though throughout the memoir, among all of the other moods that are portrayed, there is the dominant mood of eternal gratefulness. The fact that the parents went through so much, facing numerous hardships and challenges, just for their kids to have a better time and a promising future is beyond the realm of words. Words do not exist that can fully describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did. This is the mood, and moods, that are portrayed in this memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
1050	12876	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is that of a bright and happy mood. The memoir is about a Cuban family who have a strong desire to live in America to give their son a better life. Their parents selflessly gave up their jobs as respected scientists for their son. The story is in a good mood because there is true love being spread all around. Narciso Rodriguez lived in a happy mood, surrounded by the love of his family and the support of their community. This memoir shows that love and sacrifice can create a joyous and fulfilling life."
1051	12877	5	3	"The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Throughout the narrative, the author often delved into the actions of his parents. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he detailed what his parents did, and after almost every sentence, in parentheses, he would express how much those actions meant to him. For example, he described how his parents cooked, and right after that, he added: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This clearly shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skills. In one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again highlights the mood of gratefulness, happiness, and reflectiveness permeating the story, making it a touching account of family and appreciation."
1052	12878	5	3	"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This Cuban family made the brave decision to move from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They embarked on this journey with no clue what to expect, lacking any prior knowledge of the culture or anything else in the new place. All they had was each other, and this strong bond among family members gives off a great sense of family unity. Then there is the happiness factor. Throughout the story, no matter what the circumstances were, they seemed to be happy because they had family by their side. In the story, it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This indicates that he truly views his house as a home, and that feeling of home means he is happy, making the memoir a heart - warming tale of family and contentment."
1053	12879	5	3	"The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It vividly tells how Narciso's parents made a huge sacrifice. They gave up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, for a while, most of Narciso's family did not have homes. This is truly sad because they did not have a place to call their own. ""Countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" This sacrifice and the difficult situation create a sad undertone in the memoir, making it a poignant account of immigrant struggles."
1054	12880	5	3	There in the family from Cuba, the father came in 1956 with the hope of a good future for the family. @CAPS1 had one apartment of two rooms. @CAPS1 had two sons in @CAPS3. One was a young man of twenty - one, and the other was twenty - seven. They were starting a new life in a new place, facing the challenges and opportunities that came with it, with the family's well - being as their main goal.
1055	12881	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This description clearly shows that his house was a place without any yelling or fighting, creating a peaceful atmosphere. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" This shows that while he grew up, his home was a comfortable place for him, full of joy and togetherness. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""the kitchen in this humble house where a @LOCATION1 feast always filled the air, but also life and love."" This indicates that his family was calm and loved each other deeply. The author says in paragraph @NUM3 ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This shows he was comfortable growing up in his house even though he didn't have lots of things. In conclusion, the author creates a mood of calm and comfort for the memoir, making it an inviting and pleasant read."
1056	12882	5	3	"In this memoir, the author skillfully creates a mood which, for me personally, completely sucked me into this captivating memoir. I firmly believe that Narciso Rodriguez crafted a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he vividly states, ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" it instantly reminds me of my own family and how my family whole - heartedly loves cooking Puerto Rican food. The enticing smell is just like, ""you're home."" In my home, everyone is whole - heartedly accepted, even if you're not related. Narciso also mentions this in his memoir. Additionally, Narciso is extremely grateful in his memoir because his parents immigrated to have a better life. This creates a warm, loving, and family - centered mood. Narciso poignantly says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Now that they've immigrated, Narciso Rodriguez will always cherish and never forget his childhood home. There are indeed many evocative moods in this memoir, making it a truly immersive read."
1057	12883	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood encompasses a blend of happiness, sadness, and gratitude. Narciso is extremely happy because he typically gets to spend quality time with his ""family"". He is also overjoyed that his family is with him and that more family members will come from Cuba in a few years. This anticipation of a growing family circle fills him with a sense of excitement and contentment. However, he is sad because he can't see his beloved grandfather. Moreover, he feels sad that his parents didn't get to live as great a life as he does. He is deeply grateful for being alive and for his parents doing everything for him. Their sacrifice in bringing him to Miami is something he holds dear. He is grateful because he got to live such a wonderful life because of his parents' selfless actions. In essence, these mixed emotions create a rich and complex mood in the memoir."
1058	12884	5	3	The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez creates in this memoir is a very appreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir, he is clearly expressing how incredibly thankful he is for his parents moving to Miami to give him a better life. He shows profound appreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds. At one significant point in this memoir, he sincerely says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done. He tells his parents this heartfelt statement to let them know just how brave he thinks they are. His words in the memoir effectively convey his deep - seated gratitude and respect for his parents' sacrifices, making the mood of the memoir a touching and appreciative one.
1059	12885	5	3	His mood was one of pure happiness. Being with his family, sharing laughter and stories, being gathered with your loved ones around the dinner table or in the living room, having great times with your family members like going on picnics or watching movies together, taking chances with your family such as trying new sports or games, exploring the world hand - in - hand, never being afraid to go somewhere new like a different city or a new park, expressing your feelings to each other openly and honestly, always being there for each other in times of joy and sorrow, being yourself without any pretense, not changing for anyone, and taking risks to a different state to experience new cultures. Don't be afraid to share your dreams and fears with one another and always stand by one another. Always be yourself, express yourself exactly how you want to be and don't change for anybody, because that's what makes family and life truly wonderful.
1060	12886	5	3	The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a genuinely happy mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a detailed and engaging explanation and description of his life at home. He paints a vivid picture of the daily happenings, the warmth of the family interactions, and the simple joys of home life. The author created a happy mood also because it clearly showed that his parents were not selfish and that they selflessly wanted their children to have a better life in the United States. They had the courage to leave their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to face and deal with racism. But, they were still unwavering in their happiness and determination. So, they all worked together happily and in unity, supporting one another through the tough times. I think it shows that the author not only had a loving family in a nice house, but also a sense of community in the neighborhood as well. The story gave me a strong sense of a really good, close - knit family and emphasized the importance of family bonds. This happy mood makes the memoir a heart - warming and inspiring read.
1061	12887	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it clearly states ""...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This particular statement is a strong example of pride as it says ""for which I am eternally grateful,"" vividly showing that the author will always be proud of Cuban food and the connection it holds. Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph @NUM1 where it says ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This also serves as an example of pride because it shows that the author was raised with Cuban music and still has a deep - seated love for listening to it, indicating a sense of pride in their Cuban heritage. Overall, the author's expressions throughout the memoir clearly convey a mood of pride."
1062	12888	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author truly appreciates his family and the significant things his parents have done for him. It also vividly shows how incredibly happy the family was and how everyone around them was considered family, regardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" which emphasizes the inclusive and warm - hearted nature of their family concept. This inclusive view of family adds to the uplifting mood of the memoir, making it clear that love and togetherness were the true foundations of their family life."
1063	12889	5	3	"The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to create was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement clearly shows thankfulness because the author is directly saying thank you to her parents for everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she has started to deeply realize how hard her mom and dad had to work to provide a house and put food on the table. The author's words throughout the memoir consistently point towards this feeling of thankfulness, making it evident that the main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness."
1064	12890	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso truly appreciated all that his parents did for him. They selflessly gave up a home in Cuba for him, their jobs, and even a part of their happiness. The love aspect is prominent because they all loved each other deeply, and family meant a great deal to them. They firmly believed that family is composed of people who care for one another, even if they are not blood - related. It doesn't matter whether there is a biological connection; it's all about the love and the care they share. This emphasis on love and appreciation is woven throughout the memoir, creating a warm and touching mood.
1065	12891	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic, warm, and thankful. In the memoir, the author elaborately explains the importance of family, carefully recounts his experiences with family, and sincerely thanks his family for all the important life lessons they have taught him. In paragraph two, the author says: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This detailed excerpt powerfully conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author fondly praises his childhood home. In paragraph three, the author says: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sentence also effectively makes the reader feel nostalgic and warm because the author really gives the reader a clear sense of his childhood community's unity and love. In paragraph five, the author says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" In this sentence, the author truly conveys his overwhelming sense of thanks for his parents to the reader as he praises them. In paragraph six, the author says: ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and Friends are."" And later in paragraph seven: ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'Family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These excerpts really sum up the author's deep - seated feelings about family. They explain to the reader just how important Family is and how thankful the author is for his family and all the life lessons they have taught him. These well - chosen excerpts truly convey the mood of nostalgia, warmth, and thankfulness to the reader, leaving a lasting impression of the author's family - centered values."
1066	12892	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir. First, the author has a deep - seated love for cooking. His parents patiently taught him the art of cooking, sharing all their skills and secrets. He is eternally grateful for his parents' guidance and love in this regard. Second, his mother and father ""had come to @LOCATION1 with such remarkable courage, without any prior knowledge of the language or the culture. They left behind their beloved country, all their familiar surroundings, just to give a better life to Narciso @PERSON1."" Third, his parents had a simple yet cozy house. They always filled the air not only with the enticing scent of home - cooked meals and the lively rhythm of music but also with the warmth of life and love. In summary, these are the moods created by the author in the memoir."
1067	12893	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez wrote fondly about his memories of growing up in Newark, New Jersey. With a gentle and affectionate tone, he creates a mood of pure bliss. He describes his neighborhood as ""a community of honest, hard - working immigrants."" ""Growing up in this warm and inclusive environment gave me a deep - rooted sense of family"" that had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This description paints a vivid picture of kind, smiling faces, a tightly - knit group of people always ever - willing to help one another. Rodriguez tells of his parents' amazing feat of transforming a simple house into a beautiful home.

In the @NUM1 paragraph, he sincerely says ""I've often told them of my deep - seated admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Here, he clearly shows his compassion for his parents because they made the difficult decision to leave Cuba and go to @LOCATION1 to start a brand - new life. They wanted a better education for their children, so they left behind their family, friends, and everything familiar to them just to restart their life. Another way Narciso shows love to his parents is by integrating what his parents did for him into his own life. He made good use of the better education they provided to build a better life for himself. Now, he has become a well - known fashion designer. Therefore, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", he effectively shows a mood of love throughout."
1069	12895	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood the author created is one of love. This is because he shows that his parents selflessly gave up what they had in Cuba to come to @LOCATION1 for a better future for their children. For example, his @CAPS1 had a stable job working in a laboratory in Cuba, and his mom was deeply involved in studying chemical @CAPS2. They left all that behind to settle in Newark, @ORGANIZATION1. The author describes how he grew up in a traditional Cuban home where you could always smell the rich aroma of delicious Cuban food wafting through the air, and the passionate Cuban music filled every corner of the house.

Even though his parents didn't possess a great deal materially, he was still deeply proud of his family. After all, it's not about where you live or the conditions you're in. If you come from an honest family and they stand by you during the hard moments, that's what truly matters. Family support and values are the foundation of a fulfilling life, and he recognized and cherished that in his own family.
1077	12903	5	3	The mood created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is a warm, grateful, and cheery tone. As Narciso vividly talks about his parents' Cuban background and rich tradition, through his enthusiastic tone, you can clearly tell how deeply proud and truly happy he is in his heritage. Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he speaks very highly of his parents, emphasizing how they lovingly made their house a cozy home, and how incredibly grateful he is to have them as his parents. The mood makes me vividly think of the bright color yellow, and of the warm sun, pure happiness, and comforting warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did an outstanding job setting this cheery mood in his memoir, which effectively conveys his positive emotions and love for his roots.
1078	12904	5	3	In my opinion, I truly felt like his culture meant a great deal to him, and I sensed that his house, family, and friends were all of utmost importance to him. In the first paragraph, he carefully describes his family, precisely where they lived, where they originally came from, and how old they were. This detailed description made me deeply think about my own culture and family. In the second paragraph, it tells the exact year he was born in and how his house was like. It made me eager to describe my old house, the only house filled with more precious memories than I could even think of. His neighborhood is a closely - knit community with honest, hard - working immigrants. It made me reflect on how all our communities could be if we were all hard - working. In my opinion, his memories effectively made my own memories come flooding back, highlighting the power of shared human experiences.
1079	12905	5	3	In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1, the author successfully creates a distinct mood. The mood was like an excited one because Narciso Rodriguez is a man that we can clearly tell is someone who deeply appreciates what his family did for him. Because in the memoir, it clearly says that he felt truly graceful and extremely happy about his culture. He is from Cuba, and his family is so friendly and welcoming. His family taught him a great many things, which have now become the very basis of his life. He also has important friends. Now in this memoir, he openly expresses all these feelings and also how incredibly proud he felt about his family. And his sincere admiration about his family is truly awesome. He learned from his family how to whole - heartedly love others and how to respectfully respect them. In the memoir, he says that he would never forget how his parents lovingly turned his simple house into a warm and inviting home. This is precisely how the mood is created by the author in the memoir, leaving a strong impression on the readers.
1080	12906	5	3	The author that wrote this carefully put this in a blend of sad and good memories. The text seems to touch on both the poignant moments that bring a tinge of sadness and the heart - warming instances that evoke good feelings. By presenting these contrasting memories, the author creates a rich and complex narrative. It allows the readers to experience a full range of emotions, just as life itself is a mix of joys and sorrows. This way of presenting memories makes the story more relatable and engaging, leaving a lasting impression on those who read it.
1081	12907	5	3	"I think the mood the author set is deeply loving. The story vividly describes how there was an intense love for cooking, with the aroma of delicious Cuban dishes filling the air, and a passionate enthusiasm for Cuban music that made the house come alive with rhythm. Just how the endless celebrations, filled with laughter and joy, brought a vibrant life in their warm and inviting home. Narciso Rodriguez also had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, although these different cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a unique and harmonious community."" How their parents always had their open arms and doors wide open to many people in need, knowing they would do the same for them in return. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their selfless love and great sacrifice."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a truly loving home."" The mood @PERSON2 set for this story is undeniably loving."
1082	12908	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez had created a very warm and loving mood that envelops the reader. He explained a bit about his parents when they first came here to @LOCATION1, facing the challenges of a new land with courage. Narciso also tells us that in 1961 his home was a traditional Cuban home, filled with the rich culture and traditions of their homeland. He elaborately explains his parents' remarkable culinary skills, and how he was deeply grateful to have received such a wonderful heritage from them. Also, how there was always lively music that was like an endless celebration, making every moment at home feel special. His parents ""always kept their arms and their doors open"" (@NUM1) to many of whom they considered family, offering them a safe haven. They knew that if they needed help, those they helped would do the same. Later in the memoir Narciso gets to express his personal feelings of deep gratitude and love. He explains how his parents yearned for a better life for their family, even though it meant leaving behind so much, like their close - knit families, dear friends, and well - established jobs in the country they loved. It takes great bravery to make such a sacrifice. Narciso understands this and expresses it freely, making the memoir a touching tribute to his parents."
1083	12909	5	3	"This memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a mood that clearly shows Narciso Rodriguez is extremely happy, deeply proud of his parents, and the memoir creates a strong mood of unity. First, the memoir creates a genuinely happy mood. ""Here, the pure innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless and lively celebrations that encompassed both, formed the beautiful backdrop to life in our cozy and warm home (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez is truly happy that at his home, his families, friends, and the wonderful celebrations helped form the normal life in his house. He is overjoyed that his parents worked so hard to get him to New Jersey. Rodriguez is also happy about how warmly welcoming his parents were to people who needed help, and how during the difficult time of segregation, his family and friends stayed closely together. ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" had an incredibly happy mood that makes the reader feel a part of his joy. Next, the memoir's mood shows that Rodriguez is obviously very proud of his hard - working parents. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any knowledge of the language or the local culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their beloved families, close friends, and successful careers in the country they loved"" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso Rodriguez is so proud of his parents giving up so many precious things for him. They gave up their families, friends, country, and careers all for their son, so he could live a better life in the @LOCATION2. They basically had to start over in this pursuit to get good careers, and he admires their tenacity. Finally, the mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" brings about a strong sense of unity. ""Growing up in this environment inspired in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (paragraph @NUM3) In Rodriguez's family, they took in people who needed help, who weren't part of their blood family. During a time of segregation, his neighbors, families, and friends stayed united, showing the power of community. In ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created shows that Rodriguez is happy, proud of his parents, and the memoir shows a strong sense of unity."
1084	12910	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives is deeply grateful. This is clearly shown by how Narciso carefully explains in detailed order the major chronologically ordered events of his life. Narciso also includes little sentences in parentheses, thoughtfully explaining what he had just said or directly telling how extremely grateful he was for it. This happens for example when Narciso states: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This clearly shows how he is extremely grateful that his parents taught him how to cook, a skill that he still cherishes and uses today. Narciso also shows his profound gratefulness by making it abundantly clear how thankful he was to have parents who taught him so many valuable things and did so much for his well - being. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez created a pervading sense of gratefulness as the overall mood in his piece. He did this by vividly showing how thankful he was to have parents who selflessly taught and did so much for him, making the reader feel his sincere gratitude."
1085	12911	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: Blueprints of our lives, the speaker shows many strong moods. The moods of deep gratefulness and pure happiness can be felt throughout his recollections of life. The speaker is very grateful throughout the whole memoir. But the speaker is most grateful for his loving family and the precious opportunity to come to @LOCATION1. It says, ""'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.'"" This shows that he is very deeply grateful because he realizes that if his parents were not willing to sacrifice things like their sense of familiarity and comfort, he would not have been able to go to @LOCATION1 for a better life. He also tells us that his parents left behind their close - knit friends, extended family, stable jobs and their beloved homes to come to @LOCATION1 for a better future for their children. The speaker also shows great happiness. He says, ""'countless extended family members came and went.'"" This shows he was surrounded by people he loved dearly and that made him feel truly happy. It also said that they would selflessly help people out, actively spend time with the community and regularly have people for dinner all the time. This also shows he was happy because he was spending quality time with so many family members and friends, creating a warm and loving atmosphere. These are clear examples of the wonderful moods that the author created in the memoir, which leave a lasting impression on the reader."
1086	12912	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is deeply grateful and genuinely happy. The memoir vividly explains how incredibly proud the author was of their parents. They selflessly did so much for the author. The most important thing they did was bringing family and strong relationships into the house, transforming it into an actual, loving home. This warm and nurturing environment is what the author cherishes most.
1087	12913	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", there is a distinctively proud and happy mood. This memoir is fundamentally all about heritage and the home. When he talks about his heritage, he passionately speaks about his delicious food, cozy home, and lively music, which collectively gives the reader a strong sense of pride. This is also a joyous sort of memoir because it elaborately talks about the remarkable unity of the neighborhood despite the fact that they are all from different parts of the world. This unity makes the memoir a heart - warming read."
1088	12914	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mix of being upset to have to leave Cuba but happy to be somewhere better. To have to leave behind precious memories and dear friends and family is truly upsetting. Also, it's better because now their lives will gradually get better. Everything they had before, like a sense of community and basic comforts, they will soon have here. The mood created was a complex blend of being upset but also happy and excited for the new beginning.
1089	12915	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", there are relevant and specific pieces of information precisely describing the mood created by the author. This quote or textual evidence clearly shows that the mood of the author is very ""warm"" and free. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation in the family and friends, and the lively celebrations that encompassed both, formed the beautiful backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that the author is very warm because he specifically says, ""the congregation of family and friends"", and also, ""life in our 'warm' home."" The first quote shows he was very free with his feelings and the second quote shows that he was ""warm"" inside. This quote shows that the mood the author changed to be very loving. ""I will never forget that house or its neighborhood or the many valuable things I learned about how to love."" This quote shows that the author is very loving because he says, ""learned there about how to love."" This clearly shows that the author's mood was very loving throughout the memoir."
1090	12916	5	3	The mood created by the author is overwhelmingly happy and deeply grateful towards his parents. He is happy and grateful towards them because they courageously gave up their old lives in Cuba where they had well - established good jobs, long - time friends, and close - knit family so that Narciso @MONTH1 could have a good life. The mood kind of shows his attitude of hope and that his parents' hardships selflessly created a good life for him. The mood also shows that he is extremely proud of his heritage because he whole - heartedly adores Cuban music and is truly grateful for learning culinary arts from his parents. His parents were not the only people to make him feel happy but it was also his neighbors who were also immigrants. They were incredibly kind and he felt a strong sense of unity with them. This mood is truly great and shows that anyone can find happiness even in the face of challenges.
1091	12917	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was one of deep appreciation. Narciso Rodriguez repeatedly thanks his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 and sacrificing their lives in Cuba to offer him a better future. He expresses gratitude for his childhood, specifically for the valuable lessons his parents taught him as a child and the nurturing environment in which he grew up. When the author mentions how his parents' cooking skills were passed down to him, he pauses in the article to directly thank his parents. He describes how, despite the community being composed of various races, they lived together in friendship and unity. He recalls how people often visited their house for dinner and there were numerous joyous celebrations. He also highlights the courage his mother and father showed by coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture. He notes that all immigrants leave their home countries with the sole purpose of giving their children better lives. Narciso explains that his parents had great jobs in Cuba but gave them up and took whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION1. In paragraph six, he states that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, adding that there is no way to fully express the gratitude he feels towards them. In the last sentence of that paragraph, he says, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Once again, he is thanking his parents. Throughout the memoir, he portrays his parents as heroes and thanks them for everything they did for him. That is why the mood for this memoir was one of sincere appreciation."
1092	12918	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring, clearly showing appreciation towards the author's parents. The author (@ORGANIZATION1) elaborately explains what it was like for him as a kid and emphasizes that his ""family"" doesn't always refer to blood relatives. He describes the household as being extremely humble, always having open arms and warmly welcoming others. He also points out that it wasn't about the size of the home or how expensive it was; rather, it was about the people inside it, how close they were, and the precious memories they shared. All in all, through this memoir, @PERSON1 (the author) clearly shows that he is very appreciative of his family. He wouldn't change how he grew up and is thankful to his ""family"" for instilling the spirit of generosity in him at an early age. This overall mood of love and appreciation makes the memoir a heart - warming read."
1093	12919	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct and remarkable traits. One prominent trait of the mood is selflessness and courage. It is vividly shown in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" One can't help but wonder if they would be able to throw away their life and step into an alien world just so that their children would have a better future. Undoubtedly, doing this would require an immense amount of selflessness and courage. Also, the mood has a strong sense of gratefulness. The author shows this in paragraph @NUM2 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement clearly reflects the author's deep - seated gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage in coming over to @LOCATION2 to give him a better future. Finally, unity is prominently found in the mood. It is evident in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows great unity in their neighborhood because in other parts of the United States, these three races didn't get along, but in this neighborhood they were unified. In conclusion, the author effectively depicts a mood with these distinct and inspiring traits, which leave a lasting impression on the readers."
1094	12920	5	3	"The author created a very positive and optimistic mood in the memoir. He vividly talked about how his fascinating Cuban culture was beautifully portrayed throughout his home. The author said, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" This quote clearly shows his deep - rooted love and pride for his culture. In the memoir, the author also openly expresses his extreme thankfulness towards his parents. He greatly admires their courage. Narciso felt that his parents did everything within their power to give their family a good life and that they were indeed successful in doing so. Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement shows that he has a genuine and heartfelt appreciation for what they did. He firmly believed that family encompasses everyone that you love and are close to, not just blood relatives. Narciso considered his community to be one giant, loving family. This memoir had an upbeat tone due to the unwavering positivity and optimism of the author, making it an engaging and inspiring read."
1095	12921	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir initially seems rather disjointed in terms of developing the character. It's as if the writing pace goes slow, then fast, and then slow again. The writer can't seem to control the flow of the story, which makes the mood feel erratic, like one has to think fast one moment and then think hard the next. Next time, the writer should maintain a consistent speed because otherwise, readers might give up on the story. Who knows, that story could have been truly outstanding, but just because it couldn't stay at one speed, it fails to hold the readers' attention. Now, I (@CAPS2) am not the one to talk because I can't write as well, but I do read a lot and am very willing to share my thoughts. So, take it from a reader, not a writer. Also, the story was rather plain, following the typical pattern of being bad before it gets good. I think if the writer, whether he or she, had gone slower in describing the story, it would have been quite different. In the first @NUM1 minutes, I was like, ""Oh, this is like any other story. @CAPS2 is going to stop reading right now. It's so boring and rushes to the answer."" Writers should be careful about how they write or choose these stories. They don't know what's best for me, but I do. They don't know me from a hole in a wall. They should get a better writing approach."
1096	12922	5	3	In the memoir, the mood was joyously happy and deeply loving. When they had their house, it became a warm haven where their families would be whole - heartedly welcomed in, and even strangers would find a friendly and inviting atmosphere. His parents were extremely loving as they were consistently so kind to people, and they would hardly ever get into arguments. The family exuded such enthusiasm and happiness simply because their family was all together, creating a truly wonderful and affectionate environment.
1097	12923	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it elaborately explains how your house can have a profound effect on you as a child and even when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is genuinely comforting. I think this because when the memoir mentioned that he had a large number of relatives around, along with friends, it likely made him feel at ease and comfortable. Also, his parents were very welcoming and kind - hearted, so you would probably feel a sense of comfort because of that too. That is precisely what I think the mood of the memoir is and the reasons behind it.
1098	12924	5	3	"In the memoir, the author skillfully created the mood that made it evident there was a close - knit relationship. The author made the relationship very close from every aspect. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly says, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author bestowed a sense of happiness upon the cultures they had settled with, giving them both friendship and a feeling of contentment. The author also vividly described their friendship with their neighbors. In paragraph @NUM2, he wrote, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author believes that if his family considers other families as part of their family, then the other families will reciprocate and consider the author's family as part of theirs. Families have always been closely connected to each other. The author said he will never forget his own family. He wrote in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will never forget that home or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love."" The author effectively shows the close relationships of his neighborhood and all his friendships. The author successfully created a close - relationship mood while writing his memoir."
1099	12925	5	3	"The mood created by the @PERSON1 in the memoir was to vividly show how blissfully happy it was for Narciso Rodriguez growing up. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" And when the @PERSON1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" as you can clearly see, the mood of the story is warm and it tells us about how he had an idyllic childhood. This warm mood truly captures the essence of his happy upbringing."
1100	12926	5	3	"In the memoir, there is more than one mood, but this is the predominant one. First, the author is earnestly trying to create a ""no place like home mood,"" and the author achieves this goal quite successfully. It seems he/she is using cherished memories and sharing his/her personal background. The mood was also very calm and extremely relaxing for the story, making the readers feel at peace as they follow the narrative. In conclusion, this is the distinct mood the author is effectively conveying to the audience."
1101	12927	5	3	"In the excerpt from Narciso Rodriguez's *Home: The Blueprints of our lives*, there is a specific mood set. I think it's love and warmth. For example, in paragraph 3 it says, ""I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my birthdays."" This shows the inclusive and loving atmosphere that the author experienced in his home, which contributes to the overall mood of the excerpt."
1102	12928	5	3	In the memoir, the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life, while also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the people that live on the street. Also, by how he feels so comfortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner, he can call them family. This combination of serious and light - hearted elements makes the memoir both engaging and thought - provoking, ultimately creating an uplifting mood.
1103	12929	5	3	"The author creates a very warm, happy, welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time. The author Narciso Rodriguez never mentions any bad times and shows how kind everyone is. This quote from the memoir proves that Narciso is creating a good mood throughout the story: ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote, I think, shows very well that the author is creating a happy mood in his memoir, making the readers feel the joy and contentment that the author experienced in his home."
1104	12930	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's parents came (or emigrated) from Cuba into Miami, where they were not wealthy and many racial barriers stopped them from getting good jobs. However, Narciso, who is writing the memoir, explains how they sacrificed it all so that he could have a better life and how much they helped their neighbors and their family. Rodriguez writes a lot about how they always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family. Narciso emphasizes this mood, a mood of ""good will"" and a neighborly love, how they treated everyone as family. The mood Narciso creates is that where you find the good in a life where there might not be too much good, highlighting the power of kindness and community in difficult circumstances."
1105	12931	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was both loving and inspiring. This was the mood of the story because the author mentioned how his home was filled with a lot of love and how he is grateful for the sacrifice that his parents made for him. (Rodriguez, 5) In his community that was filled with hard - working immigrants, they came together in great solidarity and friendship. (Rodriguez, 8) The author's parents had come to the country with courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture, which he will always be grateful for. (Rodriguez, 12) His home was always filled with life and love. The author said that he would never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there about how to love. He would never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, and this enduring memory further cements the loving and inspiring mood of the memoir.
1106	12932	5	3	The mood in the memoir was in a way sad. The reason why it was kind of sad is that they came into this country empty - handed. They had to cram into a @NUM1 - bedroom apartment, living in a rather cramped space. Even so, they still managed to make it and were able to earn money. They also achieved a better living style, which shows their perseverance and hard - work. This journey from hardship to a better life, though tinged with initial sadness, is a testament to their resilience.
1107	12933	5	3	It seems kind of a mix of happy and sad, with a greater tilt towards happiness. They were sad because they had to leave everything behind in Cuba, including their homes, friends, and familiar surroundings. However, the hope for a new and better future brought them a sense of happiness. This complex blend of emotions reflects the difficult yet potentially rewarding experience of starting anew.
1108	12934	5	3	The mood in the passage is @CAPS1. It is @CAPS2 because they can offer their child a more promising and stable life. Next, Cuba is not a favorable place to be in due to various circumstances. They are @CAPS2 because they get to start a brand - new life afresh. Another reason is that they can obtain better - paying and more stable jobs here. They get to live in a @CAPS3 house, which is far more comfortable than the one in @CAPS4. They are @CAPS2 so they can also offer a helping hand to other refugees. Finally, they are @CAPS2 for other refugees as they celebrate their arrival to the country, creating a sense of community and hope.
1109	12935	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood could be a lot of things. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a @CAPS2 mood. First of all, I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it clearly stated ""... and for which I am eternally grateful."" Also, it said ""which I adore to this Day."" I can tell that those were a @CAPS2 mood because if I were in the same situation and said such words, it would definitely convey @CAPS2. Moreover, there was nothing indicating that @CAPS1 disliked it. Second of all, @CAPS1 would always express to his Parents that ""I will always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice."" He also told them ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Therefore, due to these two reasons, the mood of the memoir is a @CAPS2 mood that the author created."
1110	12936	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir. One way I could describe the memoir is that it makes you feel good about things. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it clearly says, ""I will always be grateful for my parents' love and sacrifice."" This statement shows the deep - seated positive emotions within the memoir. @CAPS1 mood the memoir sets is a warm mood. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 it mentions that his houses were the places where he learned the real and profound definition of family. As you can see, these aspects clearly illustrate that there are indeed many ways to describe the heart - warming mood of the memoir."
1111	12937	5	3	In the @ORGANIZATION1 memoir, when in 1961 Narciso was born into a simple Cuban house. This Cuban home was brimming with rich traditions, and the very heart of it was the cozy kitchen. His parents, who had a deep - seated love for cooking, are still with him today, and for this presence and their love, I am eternally grateful. He has a passionate love for music, which he adores to this day. His neighborhood was mainly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants like his family. His mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any knowledge of the language or the local culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. Even though it meant leaving behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and promising careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, bravely enduring the harsh Northern winters while longing for their native tropics and facing various cultural hardships. His demeanor shows lots of positive things about his family. He is proud of what he is and what he stands for, having the blood of being Cuban. He seems very pleased with his family's success, and this sense of family pride and contentment is a beautiful part of his story.
1112	12938	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a calm and loving mood. The author first vividly shows a loving mood when he says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such incredible courage, without any knowledge of the language or the local culture... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved."" This shows a loving mood because the parents were so determined to give their children a better life by moving to America, even though they were leaving a great deal behind. The author shows a calm mood when he says ""always filled the air with not just delightful scents and soothing music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'"". This quote puts a calm mood because when you think of filling the air with pleasant scents and playing nice, relaxing music, it puts you in a calm, relaxed state of mind. This quote also shows a loving mood as well. This is because it explains his deep love for his family and that he is proud to call his family a family. All in all, the above evidence clearly sets the memoir's mood as loving and caring, making the readers feel the warmth and affection within the pages."
1113	12939	5	3	The author skillfully created a distinct mood in the memoir. The mood in the memoir is about sharing with someone, even if you initially don't want to. This mood implies that there is a certain pressure or an underlying sense of connection that compels one to open up. Maybe it's the power of the story within the memoir that makes the characters or the readers feel the need to share their innermost thoughts and feelings. It could be that the experiences described in the memoir are so relatable that they break down the barriers of reluctance. In the end, this mood emphasizes the importance of communication and the potential for positive change that comes from sharing, even when it's difficult.
1114	12940	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood that the author created is one of profound gratitude. ""I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice,"" Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, first sentence. This simple yet powerful statement encapsulates the essence of the mood. His parents' actions, whatever they may be, have left an indelible mark on him. Their love and sacrifice have shaped his life, and he recognizes this with a sense of humility and thankfulness. This mood of gratitude permeates the memoir, making the readers feel the depth of his emotions towards his parents and the impact their actions have had on his life."
1115	12941	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is very warm, happy, and inviting. Since the whole story portrays this mood, I will tell you some specific reasons why. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez tells you how everybody in his neighborhood were like a big, friendly family. They were good friends and would always readily give a helping hand to people in need. Paragraph @NUM2 goes into more detail about paragraph @NUM1, telling us how many of Rodriguez's neighbors, friends, and relatives regularly joined him and his family at dinner. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door wide open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This open - hearted hospitality added to the warm and inviting atmosphere. In paragraph @NUM4, Rodriguez states how his parents selflessly came over to the U.S.A to give him a better life. They gave up everything they had, including their familiar surroundings, friends, and local opportunities, just so he could have more than his parents did. This just goes to show how much Rodriguez's parents cared for him. As you can see, these instances clearly explain why the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and inviting. (Also heart - warming!), leaving the readers with a feeling of comfort and contentment."
1116	12942	5	3	I believe the author's mood was serious, perhaps due to the weighty subject matter they were addressing. This seriousness likely influenced the tone and message conveyed throughout the work.
1117	12943	5	3	"The mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude. The author is very grateful to his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him. For example, they came to the United States from Cuba, without a clue of its customs or language. They had to start from scratch in a new and unfamiliar land. The author's parents left behind their careers, their families and friends, just so that they could have a better life for their baby. They endured many hardships and uncertainties. The author's parents let people stay in their home so that they could get back on their feet, showing their kind - heartedness. The author's gratitude is clearly shown in paragraph six when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The author clearly states that he is grateful for all that his parents have given him. The author also says that he thinks that what his parents did for him was the ""most courageous thing [that he] could have ever done."" Overall, this memoir is a beautiful tribute to the selfless love of parents."
1118	12944	5	3	The mood in this memoir was happiness. It was happiness because he talks about how much his parents care not only about their family but also friends. His parents' caring nature creates a warm and positive atmosphere. For instance, they might organize gatherings for friends or offer help in times of need. This kind of inclusive and loving environment makes the memoir radiate with happiness. In conclusion, the author effectively conveys a happy mood through the description of his parents' actions.
1119	12945	5	3	In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones, like being wrapped in a soft blanket of affection. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling, like a precious moment etched in your memory. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created memories that would last a lifetime. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers, as if you're in a protected bubble. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each @DATE1 down the cape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear, and it evokes a sense of longing for such a comforting state.
1120	12946	5	3	"In the short story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of the short story is grateful and reasonable. In the story a man named Narciso Rodriguez, twenty - seven years old, migrated from Cuba in 1956 with his parents to come to the United States. When they came they had to live in a one - bedroom apt. as they could afford nothing else. They were cramped in a small space, yet Narciso was being very grateful. Even though they had nowhere to work in places with bigger pay, they had to take low - paying jobs. So they only had little pay to feed their family. They had to make do with meager resources. Narciso is grateful in paragraph @NUM1. @CAPS1 says ""They struggle both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters."" They faced not only financial difficulties but also the challenges of a cold climate. @CAPS1 had to settle for what was given to him at the time, showing his reasonable acceptance of the situation. In conclusion, the story effectively portrays Narciso's grateful and reasonable attitude in the face of adversity."
1121	12947	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is the idea of sacrifice and generosity. @PERSON1's parents came to @LOCATION1 as immigrants from Cuba, embarking on a perilous and arduous journey across the sea. By doing this, they took a very risky and difficult journey in order to make @PERSON1 have a more successful life. The parents gave up the comfort of seeing their families regularly, the joy of being with friends, and their well - established careers in the country they loved. Narciso displays generosity by saying ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", showing that he deeply appreciates the selfless acts of his parents."
1122	12948	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" by the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood was happiness because he had his rich heritage, loving family and close friends, and the exciting chance to make new lives in @LOCATION2. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music"", which is a clear indication of the cultural richness he holds dear. This quote is relevant because it shows that @PERSON2 is happy to have his heritage, the unique skills and the vibrant music that are part of his roots. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Family and friends, and celebrations that encompassed them both."" This quote is relevant to the question because it shows that the warmth of friends and family gatherings made Narciso truly happy. In paragraph @NUM3 it states ""In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find."" This quote is relevant to the question because it shows that Narciso's family has the resilience and opportunity to make whatever they want out of their lives. That is the mood in the memoir ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1"" by Blueprints of Our Lives, a mood filled with happiness and hope."
1123	12949	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is... LOVE and Sacrifice. He often told them that what they did, leaving behind their homeland and starting anew, was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done. As he was growing up, the close - knit and supportive environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He often told them of his deep admiration for their strength and perseverance in the face of difficulties, and he thanked them repeatedly with sincere gratitude. As he says ""he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a warm and loving home"", highlighting the power of their love and sacrifice."
1124	12950	5	3	The mood created by the author in @CAPS3, like in @CAPS4 @NUM1, it says that My Mother And My Father had to come to this country with such great courage. They stepped into an unknown land without any knowledge of the language, struggling to communicate, or the culture, facing unfamiliar customs. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. Even though it meant leaving behind the familiar faces of their families, the long - standing friendships, and the careers they had built with hard work in the country they loved. This shows the selfless and brave mood that the author has created in the work.
1125	12951	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author was respect. For example, the story told the boy that you don't have to be a blood relative to be part of a family. The author states ""@CAPS1 growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", emphasizing the inclusive nature of family. Another reason was that you should always help your family members during bad times. For example, the book reads ""Countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"", showing the spirit of mutual support. Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance, the author quotes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" All these aspects contribute to the mood of respect that the author has successfully created in the work."
1126	12952	5	3	"The mood in this memoir, as I perceive it, would be happiness because his parents bestowed happiness upon him through their constant presence and the homely atmosphere they created. The statement ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" clearly shows the profound impact they had on his life. It reveals just how much they've done for him, and he genuinely appreciates it. Overall, this memoir recognizes that family and happiness are intertwined, creating a warm and fulfilling experience."
1127	12953	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", was undeniably sad. This is evident as he frequently mentions his lack of knowledge about parts of his real family. Moreover, his living situation in an apartment adds to the sense of isolation and melancholy. The combination of these factors paints a picture of a person longing for a deeper connection with his roots and a more stable family environment. In conclusion, the overall mood of the story is one of sadness and longing."
1128	12954	5	3	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, a very strong and deeply touching mood is skillfully crafted. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez poignantly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line vividly describes the mood as extremely loving and touching, as it clearly shows the immense love he holds for his parents for the life they provided him. Additionally, in the same paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez mentions, ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This further emphasizes the mood as very calm and loving, as he is truly grateful for the life his parents gave him. In paragraph seven, the last sentence truly captures the mood, as he expresses his love for his parents and the house where he grew up, saying, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In summary, this memoir effectively conveys a mood of extreme love and gratitude."
1129	12955	5	3	"The mood created by the author is predominantly fairly formal, although it contains a few informal elements. For instance, a formal paragraph, such as paragraph number one, sets the stage for the entire memoir. It uses formal transitions like ""After [living]"" and is highly informative. It details his parents' immigration to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba, highlighting their financial struggles and inability to afford a luxurious home like they could in Cuba. On the other hand, an informal paragraph in the memoir, like number six, describes his deep gratitude for his parents' selfless and giving nature. He uses informal transitions such as ""But, [in reality]"" and ""these..."". This paragraph also has an informal tone. In conclusion, the memoir strikes a good balance between formal and informal settings, which effectively keeps the reader engaged."
1130	12956	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", a distinct mood is established. The primary mood emphasizes the importance of maintaining peace within the house. It encourages readers to be truly grateful and appreciative of what their parents do and provide. Another significant mood is the idea of keeping your house open to family and friends, hoping they will reciprocate. Regardless of whether you are poor or living in a small house, the concept of ""family"" remains constant. As the memoir states, ""family can turn a simple house into a home"", highlighting the power of family bonds to create a warm and loving environment. In essence, the memoir conveys valuable lessons about family, gratitude, and the significance of a harmonious home."
1131	12957	5	3	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates an overall mood that combines a sense of happiness with a tinge of sadness. In paragraph @NUM1, the author vividly explains what it was like to live in his home in Cuba. The way he describes his experience of standing in the kitchen, cooking delicious meals while listening to the soothing music, gives the reader a truly warm feeling. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends gathered around the dining table, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him but also allows them to clearly see the strong unity within his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was full of love and togetherness. ""It was a close - knit community of hardworking immigrants..."" On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had when they moved to @LOCATION1. ""They struggled both personally and faced emotional turmoil and financially"" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are effectively shown in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."
1132	12958	5	3	"The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir is a very good and bright one. He and his parents endured hard times in their New Jersey home, such as the harsh segregation of @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 individuals like himself and the constant worry of not always having enough money to make ends meet. Yet he and his family survived because of the strong unity of his closely - knit community. Immigrants from @ORGANIZATION2, the @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and elsewhere all came together and chose to ignore their differences. They shared delicious home - cooked food, opened their homes to each other, and spread happiness among themselves. There was a certain unwavering trust among the community, every family holding their door open for anybody, ""knowing that they would do the same for [them]."" (paragraph @NUM1) To make the mood of this excerpt very light and cheerful, Rodriguez uses words like, ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" (∂ @NUM2) ""innocence of childhood,"" (∂ @NUM2), ""hard working"", (∂ @NUM4), ""courage,"" and ""selflessly,"" (∂ @NUM5) ""grateful... love and sacrifice,"" ""admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" ""spirit of generosity."" (∂ @NUM6). All of these words show that through solidarity, hope, and courage, people can make a good life for each other, no matter how difficult their initial situation is."
1133	12959	5	3	"Based on the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author in the memoir could be described in many ways. To begin with, the boy is extremely grateful for his parents and deeply adores them. In paragraph two, it states, ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties with enthusiasm and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" Moreover, his parents left the country Cuba to have a better life for their children. In paragraph five, it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their beloved families, dear friends, and promising careers in the country they love."" Additionally, he thanks them and admires their strength and perseverance, and he has thanked them repeatedly. As you can see, the mood of the memoir created by the author could be described in many ways, mainly characterized by gratitude and love."
1134	12960	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a very calm mood. For me personally, home has always been a place where I can find calmness and peace. The author further emphasizes the mood by using words like gentle aromas that waft through the air and passionate descriptions of family moments. The author sets a calm, kind, and gentle mood by talking about the warm gatherings of family and the sincere friendships. In conclusion, the author effectively sets a calm and kind mood by using carefully chosen words and subject matter that I feel are inherently calming, making the reader feel at ease while reading.
1135	12961	5	3	"The mood created by the author (Narciso Rodriguez) in the memoir was that he was deeply grateful and appreciative for his life, and also genuinely happy with it. Throughout this memoir, I think he has truly realized and is clearly explaining what family really means, and that he is extremely grateful for having one. You'll figure this out when you read this because he states, ""Growing up in this warm and inclusive environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relatives."" What he also says that proves his mood was grateful is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice."" Additionally, with all this being said, I believe that's what his mood was throughout the memoir, a mood filled with gratitude and contentment."
1136	12962	5	3	He creates a calming and outgoing mood for the stories he makes. The reader can vividly feel, smell, and hear the Cuban and Spanish influence around him in his home. The feeling inside his home is warm and bright, with the soothing and vibrant Hispanic vibe that runs through the stories bringing a great feeling to the reader, making them truly immerse in the unique atmosphere.
1137	12963	5	3	"From the reading ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez, a certain mood is set throughout the entire reading. That mood is a happy and friendly one. They based their lives on family and happiness inside their home. He said that ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open."" This clearly shows that if family or friends needed help, they were always there for them. It also stated that people in your family don't have to be blood - related, and many people were welcome to eat dinner with them. This indicates how nice and how well the neighborhood got along. They would also surround themselves with Cuban food and music, showing that they were proud of who they were and that they made their new home a nice and peaceful environment, which truly reflects the warmth of family and community."
1138	12964	5	3	"The author talks about home and family, which creates a calm, caring, and happy mood. The author created these moods by talking about memories and how her parents moved from Cuba to give their child a better life. They would take in family members in need until they got back on their feet. She said her parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to her their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that still remains with her today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the wonderful aromas of the kitchen. This is like a happy mood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This definitely shows a calm and happy mood, making the readers feel the charm of family and home."
1139	12965	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood was very happy and made me thankful. My grandparents moved to the U.S. when my mom was just six. They wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life. This is the main reason why I am thankful. I live in the United States. The mood is also happy because everyone loved each other. They didn't have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing, and family came over a lot. The door was always open in the Rodriguez house. The last sentence in this memoir ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made me smile as it was so beautiful. This is how the mood was happy and made me thankful. The next time I see my grandparents, I will make sure to thank them for moving to the U.S. and giving our family a better life, as their sacrifice has brought so much happiness to us."
1140	12966	5	3	I believe the mood that sets off in the beginning of the story is how in her house, Cuban music and great aromas from Cuban cuisine fill the air. I also think that it gives a clear picture of laughter and happiness. And I think that throughout the story, the narrator realizes through spending time with the community that his parents are teaching him. Just because someone isn't blood - related doesn't mean they can't be like family, as said in the package. They are teaching him that it is also the people that love you and care about you. As the narrator continues through the passage, it says that his family is always open to take care of people that they love and need help. The narrator soon realizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was so that they could provide a nice home for him and teach him a valuable lesson in life, the true meaning of family, which is a precious gift.
1141	12967	5	3	In the memoir, this is how the author crafted the mood. He vividly tells of how his parents lived in a dilapidated house where poverty was rampant at that time. His parents immigrated to @LOCATION1, a place full of new hopes and challenges, where Narciso was born. He was raised in the ghetto, a tough and gritty environment. When he was living here, it was during the harsh era of racism and segregation. Narciso didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were finally allowed to leave Cuba. This was precisely how the author effectively created the mood, immersing the readers in the story's setting and atmosphere.
1142	12968	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is warm, grateful, and very palpable to the reader. One mood the author conveys very deeply is that of his profound love of his family. However, his ""family"" not only consisted of blood relatives but also of the numerous immigrants living in the neighborhood. He says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these diverse cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a unique and heart - warming community."" It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them. His mood is warm and compassionate as he elaborately talks about how much each one of his community members was important to him. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he sincerely talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' selfless sacrifices, their arduous hardwork, and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the clear demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his deep - seated gratitude towards his parents. Overall, the author's use of these moods makes the memoir a touching and memorable read."
1143	12969	5	3	The mood is grateful because in Cuba, which has a central government, they had to secretly sneak into the country. Well, @CAPS2 felt extremely grateful for what his parents did, which was to give him a better life. I used to be in a similar situation. My parents took a plane to @LOCATION1. We only had @DATE1 of stay, but we overstayed. We used to have nothing, not even proper documents. As the years passed, we gradually started getting documents and finally obtained the beloved green card. So, @CAPS2 was very grateful and held his parents in high honor because of what they did, which was a selfless act of love and sacrifice for a better future.
1144	12970	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it comprehensively talks about this fashion designer's life. One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2, where it elaborately talks about his background. Narciso states ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956, full of dreams and uncertainties."" The paragraph goes on to mention his parents and their names. Next, it is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a brand - new environment. For example, he states ""Growing up in this new place instilled in me a great realization that 'Family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States, yet we found a sense of togetherness."" @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6. It shows the mood of how he deeply loves his house. For example, he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many valuable things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, this is how the author effectively creates the mood, drawing the readers into Narciso's life story."
1145	12971	5	3	The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story, I felt a wide range of emotions - happy at times, sometimes sad, and overall it made me feel good. The mood that the author is trying to sell is happiness and unity. Even though many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds were present in his neighborhood, they all came together as one harmonious community, sharing joys and sorrows. Then at other times, I felt sad because he grew up in an America where racism still cast a dark shadow. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that bring true happiness; rather, it is the family and friends that surround you every single day, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. In the end, the author's use of these moods makes the story a powerful and relatable one.
1146	12972	5	3	"The mood, or general atmosphere created in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez is one of happiness, peace, and gratitude. ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (∂ @NUM1) The author vividly explains to us how peaceful and joyous his home was. They regularly had many lively celebrations with family and friends, and everyone genuinely cared about each other. ""In our neighborhood, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (∂ @NUM2) The author lived in a truly friendly neighborhood where there was hardly any racism. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" (∂ @NUM3) They didn't only consider blood relatives as family; many people were part of their extended family. They always supported each other and had numerous celebrations. Most of the time, it was simply about a group of people who loved each other having a wonderful time together. The author was also deeply grateful, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author's parents moved to the @LOCATION1 to do what was best for their child. They had to find new jobs and worked hard to give their child a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir is a beautiful testament to the positive and loving environment the author experienced."
1147	12973	5	3	"I believe there was more of a ""thank you"" sentiment in the memoir, and here are three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is sincerely thanking his parents for enabling him to have a wonderful childhood. Like in the excerpt ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the deep - seated impact his parents' efforts had on him. Another reason I think he's thanking his parents is because he was highly praising them. In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 Narciso clearly holds his parents in high regard and is forever grateful to them. Like in the excerpt ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These are the three ways the mood was more of a ""thank you"" kind of thing in the memoir, highlighting the strong bond and appreciation Narciso has for his parents."
1148	12974	5	3	"On paragraph @NUM1 in the article, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I think that the mood the author is creating in the memoir is happiness because Narciso is extremely grateful to his parents. His gratitude is a reflection of the positive experiences and love he received from his parents. This deep - seated thankfulness brings a sense of contentment and happiness, making the overall mood of the memoir a warm and positive one. It shows that the love and sacrifice of his parents have left a lasting and happy impression on him."
1149	12975	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of our lives, it gives you a lot of different moods. One mood it gave me was happiness. I got this mood because he said passionate Cuban music filled the air, and Cuban music is normally full of energy and happiness. I know Cuban music filled the air from when it states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air"" @CAPS2 @NUM1. The lively and upbeat nature of the music contributed to the happy atmosphere. Also, I got the mood of welcomeness because his parents always warmly let people into the house. I know his parents did this from when it states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" @CAPS2 @NUM2. This open - door policy created a sense of belonging. Lastly, this gave me the mood of love. I got this feeling because his parents took on hard jobs because they loved their kids. I know this from when it states ""They had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" @CAPS2 @NUM3. These are the moods the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of our lives evokes, making it a rich and emotional read."
1150	12976	5	3	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is one of profound thankfulness. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez elaborately talks about the life his parents gave him, including the sacrifices they made and the love they showered upon him. He describes how they created a warm and loving home environment, and how they worked hard to provide for him. His expressions of thankfulness are evident in his words and the way he recounts his childhood. This thankfulness not only shows his appreciation for his parents but also makes the memoir a touching and heart - warming read. It leaves the reader with a sense of the strong bond between Rodriguez and his parents and the positive impact they had on his life.
1151	12977	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso truly sets a joyous, happy mood when he describes his home. With vivid and affectionate words, he gives the reader a clear feeling of just how much he loved his home. He sets a mood of gratefulness as well, when he describes in detail how much his parents sacrificed for him to grow up well. ""There is no way for me to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" He sets such an ecstatic mood that the reader can't help but want to be there, at his home. This is the mood that Narciso Rodriguez sets, and the way he shows the reader just how great his home really is, making the memoir a truly engaging read."

The way he felt about his childhood was portrayed beautifully in this piece, and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community - like feel. His gratefulness was infused into the mood and made the entire piece fun and heart - warming to read.
1153	12979	5	3	The main mood that is portrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States with great determination so that Narciso could have a great childhood, and he indeed did. Narciso's parents used their love and effort to turn a small, humble apartment into a happy and comforting place where people from different backgrounds would come for a happy reunion, no matter where they were from. The simple act of staying over brought people together, creating a warm and inclusive atmosphere. That is what Narciso grew up with, and he was lucky and deeply grateful for such a wonderful family environment.
1154	12980	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful. First, the author reveals her gratefulness by sincerely complimenting her mother and father. She states, ""my mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and successful careers in the country they loved"" (@NUM1). The author is grateful because her parents came to @LOCATION1. But she is especially grateful because they didn't come for themselves; they came solely for her. They gave up everything they had built for her future. Next, all her heartfelt thanking shows her being grateful. The author tells her parents of her ""admiration for their strength and perseverance"" (@NUM2) and has ""thanked them repeatedly"" (@NUM2). The author reveals gratefulness through what she tells her parents. She is grateful for their unwavering perseverance and for their incredible strength through this whole difficult process and thanks them over and over again. Finally, she is grateful when they are leaving their house. She reveals, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4). The author is being grateful here when she recognizes the house she has lived in, the house her parents have worked so hard to acquire. And now, she is grateful that they have enough money to have a bigger home. The mood created by the author in the memoir is consistently being grateful."
1155	12981	5	3	"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is extremely endearing and clearly expresses the deep - seated love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him the true meaning of caring for and loving others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefulness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). You can almost tangibly feel how grateful he is for his happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the heartfelt writing. Finally, there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home, and like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life, it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir, making it a heart - touching read."
1156	12982	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is caring and loving. Even though everyone in the neighborhood isn't blood - related, they are all still like a close - knit family. Everyone in the neighborhood is so welcoming. He tells us how his mother always leaves the door wide open, like an open invitation, for those who seek her warmth and hospitality. When they all have parties, there's a palpable joy in the air, and everyone is so happy to have what they have, cherishing these moments of togetherness. Narciso is over - grateful for the life his parents give him and he can never truly find the right words to thank them enough. He says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home."" His parents are also very grateful for how thankful Narciso is. Everyone in this ""family"" will forever love each other, bound by the strong ties of affection and shared experiences."
1157	12983	5	3	The mood the author portrays is love and unity. The author clearly portrays his deep love for his parents when he elaborately explains how selfless they were in immigrating to @LOCATION1. They left behind their familiar surroundings, sacrificing so much, such as their old way of life and close - knit communities, all for the sake of their children's better future. They also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are. They all share a similar culture, with common traditions and values, and they consider a lot of the people in their neighborhood family, even if they are not blood - relatives. A lot of their family lives close by, within easy walking distance, and they often spend time together, usually for warm, home - cooked meals as it says in paragraph @NUM1. This shared mealtime is a symbol of their unity and love, strengthening the bonds between them.
1158	12984	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The blue prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home. One way is in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixed with the enticing aromas of the Kitchen"". This evokes the mood of family. It gives you this vivid sense of a warm family gathered together, enjoying the music and the delicious food. Another way is in paragraph @NUM2. He says ""My parents always Kept their arms open wide to the many people we considered family"". This gives a loving and caring feeling, like a safe haven for those in need. It also gives the strong sense of family, where everyone is accepted and supported. The last way Narciso explains the mood is in paragraph @NUM3. In this paragraph he just gives an overall warm and inviting mood. He says how appreciative of his parents he is. He really conveys the mood to be thankful of everything they have done, from the small daily acts of kindness to the major sacrifices. These are a few ways Narciso establishes the mood of the memoir."
1159	12985	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is one of love and kindness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a helping hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was, with neighbors readily offering support and understanding. The end of paragraph @NUM2 it states ""Countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open wide to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The way that his parents helped the community out shows their general love and kindness for all, a selfless act that made the neighborhood a better place. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house were a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here that I learned the definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" It says right out that the ""scent"", or mood, is of love and that this is where he learned how to love, a lesson that will stay with him forever. The mood of this article is very loving and kind, a testament to the power of community and family."
1160	12986	5	3	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm and loving mood. First, he talks about his welcoming house. Rodriguez writes, ""...the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both..."" (@NUM1) this shows that Narciso's home was like an open - hearted haven, open to anyone who wanted to share in the joy. Also, he talks about how close he was with others. Narciso writes, ""...""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM2). This explains that everyone near him, whether they were neighbors, friends, or acquaintances, was like family, united by a common bond of love and support. Finally, his parents were able to support these bonds. He writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (p. @NUM3). This shows that Narciso's parents had to go through a lot, such as working long hours and making difficult decisions, to make it all happen. Overall, Rodriguez creates a loving mood of togetherness, a mood that makes the reader feel as if they are part of this wonderful family too."
1161	12987	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood that is created by the author is a profound sense of love and sacrifice. In the memoir, the author shows love not only by depicting the tender bond between the child and the parents but also by illustrating the warm affection that permeates throughout the community. The author shows sacrifice by elaborating on what the parents had to relinquish in order for their child to have a better life. In the memoir, it extensively talks about the neighborhood, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people."" This clearly shows the strong closeness that the people in the neighborhood shared, and this, in turn, represents the love that was present. Sacrifice is vividly shown by Narciso's parents. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and established careers in the country they deeply loved."" This explicitly shows what his parents left behind for him, truly representing sacrifice. At the end, the author also poignantly mentions ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This effectively ties up the mood throughout the memoir. Love and sacrifice is the overarching mood throughout the memoir that the author successfully created."
1162	12988	5	3	In this paragraph I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One prominent mood that the author had was a genuine sense of happiness. The reason why I say that is because every time he spoke about being Cuban or about his beloved family, he spoke with an evident joy and a deep - seated pride in his voice. Also, when he was talking about how Spanish, Italian, and Cuban cultures coexisted like a harmonious family, his tone was filled with happiness. Another mood he had was a tinge of sadness. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't meet his real grandparents until 1970, he sounded a little depressed, his voice carrying a sense of longing. However, I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the distinct moods that I think the author created during the memoir.
1163	12989	5	3	"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enshrines a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several evocative ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence that pervades her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the close - knit congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the idyllic backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel completely free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a truly warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a dear friend or a loving family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and hearty laughter and a comforting warmth, creates a positive influence that remains deeply instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the deep - seated admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his heartfelt gratefulness toward his parents, and how he greatly admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoir's content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author."
1164	12990	5	3	"The mood in this memoir changes throughout the story. First off, the mood starts with being friendly and inviting. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This clearly tells us that everyone in the neighborhood is kind - hearted and amicable. In the middle of the story, the mood shifts to being strong and determined. ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters."" This shows that the people had to steel themselves and stay strong through extremely hard times. Lastly, the end of the story is filled with gratefulness. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This tells how the narrator is deeply thankful for the experiences and the lessons learned. All in all, the moods in the story fit together seamlessly, creating a rich and engaging narrative."
1165	12991	5	3	"In this memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about how his family made his house a true home. The mood he sets throughout the memoir is a beautiful blend of love, selflessness, and gratefulness. This memoir shows love because in paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez fondly reminisces, ""countless extended family members came and went--and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even if they weren't blood - related, they still regarded each other as family and cared for one another with unwavering devotion. This memoir also has the mood of selflessness because Rodriguez says that they moved selflessly, to give their children a better life. Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved, they faced many hardships in their new country. The last mood shown in this memoir is gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez is deeply grateful for his cooking abilities, his passion for Cuban music, and most importantly, for his parents' love and sacrifice. Especially, he is extremely grateful for how his parents transformed his simple house into a loving home."
1166	12992	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is deeply respectful. First of all, Narciso's parents were incredibly courageous individuals. When Narciso talks about his parents, he says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). Narciso gives his parents the respect they truly deserve by describing their actions as ""such courage."" Moreover, Narciso's parents selflessly wanted their kids to have a better life. When Narciso explains why his parents came to the United States, he says, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). The statement ""They came...to give their children a better life"" clearly shows that Narciso's parents loved their kids so much that they did everything they could to give their kids a better future, which undoubtedly deserves great respect. Finally, Narciso is genuinely grateful for what his parents did. When Narciso describes what he feels towards his parents, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM3). When the author says, ""I will always be grateful,"" it vividly shows that the author is thankful for what his parents did for him and therefore shows profound respect. All in all, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the mood created by the author is one of deep - seated respect."
1167	12993	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was one of pure happiness. He/she wasn't sad at all because every single one of his/her memories was filled with joy. His/her memories taught him/her the true meaning of family. The tone the author gave out was that of unbridled joy. Phrases like ""Endless celebrations"" and ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" clearly convey this. Not one of the memories he/she talked about showed any trace of sadness as he/she made a lifetime's worth of friends. The author also showed us a calm and grateful mood for everything that had happened. For instance, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was anything but sad, and his/her memories taught him/her the essence of family."
1168	12994	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a distinct mood in the memoir in various ways. For example, right at the beginning of the memoir, the author is in a loving mood. In paragraph two, he says ""...a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" which clearly indicates his fondness and the loving sentiment associated with that experience. In addition, at the middle of the memoir, the author is in a caring mood. In paragraph four, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family,"" showing their inclusive and caring nature.

In conclusion, the author effectively creates a mood in the memoir through these different emotional expressions at various parts of the story."
1169	12995	5	3	The mood of the narrative in the article is a blend of happiness and excitement, along with a sense of relaxation and gratitude. This is because their grandparents are coming from Cuba. Narciso Rodriguez deeply feels that being an immigrant from Cuba and building a family in the United States is an arduous task. You have to start your whole life over from scratch so that you can get a job and provide for your family. This challenging yet hopeful situation is what I believe the mood of the article in the memoir is all about. In conclusion, the mood reflects both the difficulties of the immigrant experience and the positive emotions associated with family and new beginnings.
1170	12996	5	3	In this memoir, the mood is very light - hearted and kind. It gives you a palpable feeling of peace and a sense of community. Several times throughout the memoir, the author tries to show appreciation. It's not for any one specific thing in particular, but just a general sense of gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show his heartfelt gratitude for his life as a child. As a result of this repeated display of gratitude, while reading, you get a strong feeling of peace and kindness. Because of his consistent and repeated display of gratitude, the mood remains light - hearted and not overly serious. In conclusion, the author successfully creates a light - hearted and kind mood through his expressions of gratitude.
1171	12997	5	3	"The author creates a truly unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood, as evident from what the author is saying about his memories, is predominantly loving, caring, and kind. It exudes love because he vividly talks about all the close - knit relationships he shared with his family and friends. For instance, the quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" showcases the deep - seated love that transcended mere blood ties. The mood also has a tinge of sadness. Throughout the memoir, he expresses his gratitude to his parents for all the opportunities they provided. His words, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" carry a bittersweet undertone. Additionally, there is a palpable sense of happiness, stemming from all the wonderful memories. He fondly describes his family and friends hanging out, having a whale of a time. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author masterfully creates this multi - faceted and unique mood that lingers with the reader long after they finish reading."
1172	12998	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is clearly evident as the author details what his parents gave up, such as their own comfort and certain opportunities, just for him to have a good life. This self - sacrifice shows that his parents truly loved him, as they were driven by the desire to see him grow up and thrive. And that fulfilling life, they believed, could be found in @LOCATION1. It is extremely caring of them because when they moved to @LOCATION1, not only did they attentively look after their baby, but they also extended a helping hand to other people in need. To them, everyone in their neighborhood became part of their family, and they all took care of one another. The mood is really both loving and caring because it beautifully depicts how a group of people can be so close - knit that they love and care for each other as if they were one big family. No matter what difficulties they faced, even in hard times, one of them would always have their door open for the others, and they could always rely on each other. That is the true essence of family, as demonstrated in this memoir.
1173	12999	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very pleasant, proud, and happy. He vividly shows that growing up in such a wonderful @CAPS1 @CAPS2 family and home, he felt that the experience he had in his home was truly exceptional. He firmly believed that by growing up in this environment, it instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He was deeply grateful to his parents for their love and the sacrifices they made. He couldn't ask for anything more from them. By growing up in such a wonderful place, he will always cherish and never forget how his parents transformed their simple house into a warm and inviting home filled with love and memories. This mood in the memoir effectively conveys the author's deep - seated emotions and the significance of his upbringing.
1174	13000	5	3	In this memoir, the author creates a distinct mood. The mood that this author creates is one of gratefulness. The reason I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is extremely grateful and overjoyed to have two loving, caring, and selfless parents. He's thankful not only to have a physical house but also a warm, cozy home where he has grown up and accumulated so many precious memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional Cuban home, like the delicious food that filled the air with enticing aromas, the lively music that brought people together, and the company of all the wonderful people. Narciso is deeply appreciative that his parents basically gave up their own lives and dropped everything, leaving behind their familiar surroundings, so that he could have a better life. He cannot even fathom the courage it took for them to move @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1, not knowing the language and leaving everything they knew behind. However, that's exactly what his parents did. They sacrificed so much for him, and he values that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect as it truly captures Narciso's feelings towards his parents and his upbringing.
1175	13001	5	3	I think in some parts @CAPS1 was genuinely happy. And then in other parts, @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 is reminiscing about her first house in America. When @CAPS1 is happy, it's because @CAPS1 can vividly look back on the memories and find joy in them. Those memories might include the first time she decorated the house, the laughter that filled the rooms during family gatherings, or the sense of new beginnings. On the other hand, the sadness might stem from the passage of time, the changes that have occurred, or the longing for the past. Overall, the mix of these emotions when thinking about that first house in America adds a rich and complex layer to @CAPS1's recollections.
1176	13002	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is @CAPS1, a sentiment that is palpable throughout. I say this because @CAPS2 his family always warmly welcomed people from the neighborhood, treating them as if they were family. His parents, with kind - hearts, let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet."" He @CAPS3 admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"" even through all the hardships they had endured. In this way, the memoir's mood is deeply influenced by the family's selflessness and resilience."
1177	13003	5	3	A mood for the memoir would be redeeming. It would be a redeeming mood because it vividly talks about struggles like being an immigrant and facing poverty. It also elaborates on how a community that is going through the same struggles can come together and support one another. The author further mentions how her parents made significant sacrifices to help her achieve what she has become today. Since there are traditions that contribute to the author's path to success, it indeed creates a redeeming mood that reflects hope and growth.
1178	13004	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness. One clear way the mood is gratefulness is how deeply Narciso loves his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote clearly shows that he is truly grateful for his cultural heritage. Another way is the large number of family - like figures he has. ""Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table."" This indicates that he is thankful for all the extended family members who are an important part of his life. Lastly, his gratitude is evident in how his parents cared for him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are, making the overall mood of the memoir one of deep - seated gratefulness."
1179	13005	5	3	The mood in this memoir is that Narciso is extremely happy and very grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their strong willpower. His parents were determined to make Narciso's life better and to give him more opportunities in his life. They worked hard, overcame difficulties, and made choices that were in Narciso's best interests. This selfless dedication from his parents has filled Narciso with a sense of happiness and gratitude that is clearly reflected in the memoir.
1180	13006	5	3	The mood of the @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 and happy because Narciso Rodriguez's parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. The parents initially lived in a cramped one - room apartment for a year. When Narciso Rodriguez was born, they moved into a @NUM1 - room house. The parents, with great effort, tried to make the house as @CAPS3 as they could, creating a warm and inviting environment. This shows their love and determination, which in turn sets the @CAPS2 and happy mood of the @CAPS1.
1181	13007	5	3	The mood set by the author is very solemn. He began by depicting the scenery of the place he lived in during a time of segregation. This was particularly challenging as he was Cuban. He didn't possess much money and resided in a small apartment. His life was akin to a somewhat below - average life today. Towards the middle, the memoir was still serious but had a happier undertone. It was happier because we know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up, interacted with people, and made genuine friends. Moreover, he had a caring family that did their utmost to make his life easier. He crafted the memoir with a nice and passionate touch. The moods initially started a bit shaky and extremely serious. Then, he shifted into a happier mood by sharing how his parents and family were kind to him. It ended in the same happy mood that emerged in the middle of the passage, leaving a warm impression.
1182	13008	5	3	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable one. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir, it vividly made me think of my own home life and how crucial my family is to me. It also allowed me to see how fulfilling and wonderful his home life was too. I truly love his detailed descriptions of the delicious food cooking in the kitchen and all the enticing smells that filled the air. Also, the wonderful music that played softly in the background and the people who always came over to visit added to the charm. All that good family comfort is something we all yearn for at one time or another. That's the exact feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a sense of warmth and contentment.
1183	13009	5	3	In the memoir, the mood is very loving, @CAPS1, and thankful. The mood is loving in numerous ways. For instance, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” Also, “it's the gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.” The @CAPS1 sentiment is also expressed throughout this memoir. “It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays.” The @CAPS1 is further shown by the family often gathering at the dinner table. The most prominent mood in the memoir is how thankful he is to his parents. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” Also, “I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.” This memoir is a beautiful testament to family love and gratitude.
1184	13010	5	3	The mood is memorable because he has a deep - seated love for remembering everything he did in his childhood. He carefully puts the memories that he truly cherishes in parentheses, as if to highlight their specialness. Also, he takes the time to thank everybody for what they did in his lifetime. His act of gratitude and the way he holds onto these childhood memories make his life a memorable one. It's as if he's preserved these moments in a time - capsule, and through his writing, he shares this precious collection of memories, making it a truly memorable experience for the readers.
1185	13011	5	3	The mood created by The @CAPS1 in The memoir is soothing and @CAPS2. It explains how @CAPS2 Narciso feels when he is at his parents' house. The passage also elaborates on the large number of friends he has, which shows his sociable nature. Narciso is deeply grateful for his heritage, and this sense of gratitude helps set a positive and inviting mood. His appreciation for his roots and the comfort he finds at home contribute to the overall soothing and @CAPS2 atmosphere of the memoir, leaving the reader with a pleasant feeling.
1186	13012	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author delves deeply into explaining the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and personal as he vividly describes the love and self - lessness his family expressed. He elaborates that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to Newark, New Jersey so that Narciso, their son, would have a much better, more successful life. Reading this memoir, I can clearly picture Narciso getting very emotional, with tears perhaps welling in his eyes, as he expresses how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and the last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from a happy, appreciative, and detailed explanation of his life to a deep, incredibly personal, and profound exploration of his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends, and like most people should be able to experience, he beautifully writes about these feelings in his memoir."
1187	13013	5	3	The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was fondly remembering and cherishing the memories he had of his old home. He described his home by vividly saying how incredibly brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life. He also emphasized how his family was so rich in culture, with traditions passed down through generations. He mentioned how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough, but the author's parents, with kind hearts, never turned them down. The author made it sound that it was the perfect childhood, painting a detailed picture with such passion and emotion, and that is why the mood is so unique and special.
1188	13014	5	3	The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and full of gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a strong feeling of warmth, as if one could feel the cozy heat from a fireplace. It was very welcoming, like a well - lit door open on a cold night. He made me feel like I was invited to his home with open arms, and I could almost smell the delicious home - cooked meals and hear the laughter of the family. I could feel the environment around me, the soft carpet under my feet and the gentle hum of conversation. He gave off a feeling of gratefulness when he explained, with a voice full of emotion, how grateful he was to his parents for sacrificing everything and how much he truly appreciates everything they have done for him. He showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home, making the reader long for such a loving environment.
1189	13015	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. First, right off the bat, I felt a strong sense of love and thoughtfulness, which I still felt throughout the story. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me think of my parents immediately. My father gave up his well - established career and my mother left her close - knit family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is beyond words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, with my heart swelling with emotion, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso was palpable. She described her parents so well that I could easily put myself in her shoes. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was truly incredible and something that we can all learn from. From Narciso's story, I got a strong sense of admiration, greatfulness, and a deep connection, which I believe are the moods she created throughout his story."
1190	13016	5	3	In the memoir, a 50 - year - old man Narciso Rodriguez, Sr. could well afford to move to the modest, three - room apartment that soon became his home. (@CAPS1 @NUM2) In 1961 he was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. Narciso Rodriguez, Sr. was a man of gentle mood; he was grateful, kind, traditional, and always happy. Narciso was grateful because his parents passed down rich culinary skills and a deep love of cooking to him. He was happy because he could move to an affordable three - room apartment, which provided a stable and comfortable living space. Narciso was traditional because he would listen to Cuban Music that would fill the air, mixing with the wonderful aromas of the kitchen (@CAPS1 @NUM3). He would also have a Cuban feast which brought life and love to the family gatherings (@CAPS1 @NUM4). His babysitter, who lived above him, was his first friend and would grace his kitchen with delicious home - cooked meals. This man's life was very successful because his traits reflected positively on his community, showing the importance of family, tradition, and kindness.
1191	13017	5	3	His mood was rather complex, being both happy and a bit unsatisfying at the same time. People around also comment on how his/her life is. Considering all these aspects, I think this book, or we can say this article, is quite good. It's essentially all about his/her life story, which makes it engaging to read.
1192	13018	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, you can truly perceive the distinct moods of love, friendship, and perseverance that are masterfully created. In the second paragraph, one can vividly see the profound love that permeated Narciso Rodriguez's life and home. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to our lives in a warm home."" Love was undoubtedly a dominant mood that ran throughout the Rodriguez home, and it is prominently showcased in this memoir. Another mood that is powerfully depicted in Rodriguez's memoir is friendship. In the last sentence of the fourth paragraph, this mood becomes evident. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This sentence clearly shows the great friendship and love the Rodriguez family offered by consistently lending a helping hand. The final mood that is strongly manifested throughout this memoir is perseverance. As stated in paragraph one, the Rodriguez family moved from Cuba into a one - room apartment in New Jersey. They took whatever jobs they could get, solely desiring the best for their children. The Rodriguez family always managed to rise when they fell, and this mood shines brightly in this memoir. In this memoir, family is of utmost importance to Narciso Rodriguez, and that mood is clearly and powerfully conveyed."
1193	13019	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a heart - warming and truly comforting mood for the readers. First, we see this comforting mood being firmly established through the setting. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This creatively loving setting effectively gives the reader a strong sense of comfort when delving into the piece. Next, we notice this sense of heart - warming emerging from Rodriguez's word choice. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This rich and vivid word choice successfully sets a caring mood throughout the entire piece. Lastly, the family's background initially started out somewhat bitter and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability in @CAPS1 @NUM3. But then later on, we see the family moving to @LOCATION1 and gradually finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). This strong sense of family significantly contributes to the heart - warming mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir, making it a truly touching read."
1194	13020	5	3	"The mood that the author created in this memoir was one of deep love and sincere gratefulness. The author is earnestly trying to get their message across about how strongly a family is bonded together and how much there is to be truly thankful for. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This simple yet powerful statement clearly shows how much love the author has and how grateful they are. He is also attempting to convey that there is simply no way to fully express his emotions and love towards his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author's main point is to whole - heartedly thank their parents for everything they have done. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This memoir is a beautiful testament to the author's love and gratitude towards their family."
1195	13021	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a blend of love, happiness, and selflessness. The part of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that excerpt was love because it clearly explains how deeply he cared for his family and neighbors. There were numerous excerpts in this memoir that conveyed the mood of selflessness. For instance, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indicates selflessness by elaborating on how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all with the sole purpose of giving their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it comprehensively explained their moments of happiness, struggles, courage, the good outcome they achieved, and the beloved memories they created. This memoir is a wonderful portrayal of these positive and powerful emotions."
1196	13022	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of deep admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso sincerely admires the fact that his mother and father both courageously left their ""families, friends, and well - established careers in the country they loved."" Another mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood of family and friends because it elaborately talks about the profound meaning of family. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood - related to you, you can love them just as deeply as if they were. The memoir also said ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm, loving home full of precious memories."
1197	13023	5	3	The mood created by the author was a profound sense of gratefulness and pure happiness. The mood was one of gratefulness because Narciso was extremely glad that his parents made the decision to move to the @LOCATION1 and start their wonderful, cozy home. Narciso was truly grateful for this because he grew up in a warm and loving environment that he whole - heartedly adored. The mood created by the author is also one of happiness. The mood is happy because Narciso is overjoyed that he grew up surrounded by people who genuinely loved him. This made him happy because he always knew that he was safe and loved in the company of these people. When his diverse community came together harmoniously to form one united community, this filled Narciso with a great deal of happiness. The mood is both grateful and happy. I would also be extremely grateful for such an experience, as happiness is indeed the key to having strong friendships and close - knit families.
1198	13024	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is carefully set to vividly reflect family values and precious memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family originally hails from Cuba and they raised her in a faithful replica of a traditional Cuban home. She tells us that her parents both take great pride in cooking traditional Cuban foods and patiently teach her how to cook these delicious dishes as well. Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family members stay with her quite often. Uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents - they all come to stay with her until they are able to get back on their feet again. Finally, in paragraphs @NUM3, @NUM4, and @NUM5, it explains the great sacrifices that her parents had to make in order to start a new life in the US. It also tells about how her family generously takes in other refugees and about how she will always cherish her parents and all the wonderful memories that are associated with the house.
1199	13025	5	3	The mood of this memoir is a powerful blend of love and the unwavering commitment to staying a close - knit family. The author effectively sends a poignant message to her readers about the courage it takes when one leaves behind what they once had. Her tone, full of passion, clearly tells the mood of the memoir. The mood is essentially about being content and happy with what you have. That's exactly how the family written about in this memoir behaves. They cherish each other and the life they've built, showing that true happiness lies in appreciating the present and the people around you.
1200	13026	5	3	The mood at the beginning was a bit sad, but then Narciso starts to gradually realize the wonderful things in her life. She notices how her mom skillfully turned a simple, ordinary place into a warm and inviting home. She also says she's truly thankful for her rich Cuban heritage. In paragraph @NUM1 she expresses that she is most thankful for her caring and selfless parents. She loves them dearly not just for everything they do for her, but also for the kind and helpful things they do for the whole world. This realization helps her shift from a sad mood to one of gratitude and love.
1201	13027	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was meant to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was crafted to be happy because the child Narciso was extremely happy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. This new place offered fresh opportunities and a different life for him. He was also happy because his house was not just a physical structure; it was a warm and loving home filled with memories and comfort. Narciso was thankful because his parents selflessly let other people into the home until they had somewhere else they could call home. This act of kindness taught him the value of compassion. He is also thankful that he inherited his parents' marvelous culinary skills, which allow him to cook delicious meals and carry on the family tradition. He is also thankful for his parents' unwavering love and the countless sacrifices they made for him. The mood that we are supposed to get is a happy yet calm mood as we read this because there is nothing overly exciting, but there are some parts where you can't help but feel happy for what they did. You feel calm because, as I said, there is nothing really jumping out at you. It is just a simple yet heart - warming life story that leaves a lasting impression.
1202	13028	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic. In the memoir, the author vividly describes his home and how, even though the house wasn't large or luxurious, his parents' love and care made it feel incredibly inviting and comfortable. Every corner of the house was filled with warmth and a sense of belonging. In his neighborhood, all the people were like a big extended family. They were friends who genuinely took care of each other when they needed help, whether it was lending a hand with chores or offering emotional support. The author's home reflected the rich Cuban culture because of his parents. They brought with them traditions, music, and delicious food that made the house a unique blend of home and heritage. The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through, like adjusting to a colder climate and struggling to get good jobs. Even though they had their own troubles, they were selfless and didn't let their problems dampen their spirits. The author is very grateful for how his parents gave him a stable home and taught him what a real family was all about, a place of love, support, and togetherness.
1203	13029	5	3	The mood the @CAPS1 created was a mood of happiness and gratitude. The @CAPS1 clearly states how he will always be deeply grateful for what his parents did for him. They had worked tirelessly to provide him with a good life, making countless sacrifices along the way. He also stated that he truly admired them and honestly could never fully repay them for everything they did. This shows how the @CAPS1 respects and values how his parents worked so hard to make his life better. Their efforts were evident in every aspect of his upbringing. He is forever grateful for their love, guidance, and the opportunities they provided, and this gratitude is a central theme in the work.
1204	13030	5	3	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is set right from the very beginning. The first thing said to start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This simple statement clearly shows the author's deep - seated gratitude and genuine happiness. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the mouth - watering aromas of the kitchen."" This description not only shows how the author is very proud of his cultural heritage but also evokes a sense of nostalgia and warmth. Also, lastly, the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows how grateful the author is. In this passage, the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start, enveloping the reader in a positive and heart - felt atmosphere."
1205	13031	5	3	The mood this memoir created was a warm and grateful feeling. The author expresses his deep - seated gratitude through his praising for his parents. He talks about how they have always been there for him, guiding him through life's ups and downs. He also says how much he loves his tiny home in his hometown. That home, despite its size, holds a world of memories for him, filled with laughter, love, and family gatherings. He is extremely grateful for his parents' selflessness, as they always put his needs before their own. Their acts of kindness and sacrifice have shaped him into the person he is today. This memoir manages to capture the essence of family love and the importance of being thankful for the simple things in life, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and contentment.
1206	13032	5	3	The mood of this memoir is slightly difficult, somewhat depressing, yet filled with gratefulness, and now I am going to explain to you how. The mood is slightly difficult and depressing because there is a different culture to adapt to and a brand - new language to learn. Also, in the United States, you have to get a new job, which can be quite challenging. This short story is also grateful because you have an amazing opportunity to start a much better life and get a great education, which can open up many doors for the future. In conclusion, the mix of difficult and grateful elements makes the memoir a rich and relatable piece.
1207	13033	5	3	The title of the story is Narciso Rodriguez. The author is the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez. The mood I think the author gave to this story was pretty good. The author had a good sense of pacing; he knew when to be excited and knew when to maintain a more subdued tone, and he crafted a good story. The author effectively used exclamation marks when he was expressing happiness or sadness, which added to the emotional impact. So to me, I think this was a well - structured and engaging story, and I like it. The mood went right with the overall narrative, making it a cohesive and enjoyable read.
1208	13034	5	3	The author creates a grateful mood. The author writes about how his parents had well - established and respected jobs in Cuba, but they made the selfless decision to leave everything behind to give their children better lives. He also writes about his upbringing, where his parents took the time to teach him about music, the art of cooking, and the importance of family. His parents never got the jobs they truly deserved because they faced barriers in the new land, all for the sake of their children. The author is deeply grateful for the sacrifices his parents made so that he could get a better life. In essence, the author's words are a heartfelt tribute to his parents' love and selflessness.
1209	13035	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir exposed various emotions and contrast. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author elaborately talks about culture. He explains how certain cultural practices were so integral to their lives that they could not imagine living without them. For example, he mentions, ""Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ..."" In their neighborhood, despite different customs from elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity. Another mood the author captures is gratefulness. In paragraph six, the author explains in detail how he is extremely grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed when they moved away from Cuba. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote beautifully captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family. He looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are some of the well - crafted moods the author creates throughout the memoir, which make it an emotionally resonant piece."
1210	13036	5	3	"Throughout the story, Narciso Rodriguez shows examples of how grateful, loved, and unified his family felt as they overcame the struggles they faced and held onto the heritage they were proud of. Paragraph @NUM1 vividly illustrates the fond memories Narciso has of his house and childhood, recalling the warm and cozy moments spent there. Paragraph @NUM2 displays Narciso's strong sense of family within his local @CAPS1 community, highlighting the close - knit relationships they shared. Paragraph @NUM3 explains Narciso's parents' rough journey from Cuba to @LOCATION1, filled with hardships and uncertainties. In paragraph @NUM4, Narciso explains in heartfelt terms how grateful he is for his parents' hard work and determination, which ensured that their children could have a good life. The quote ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" wraps up the whole article perfectly. It shows how deeply grateful and cared for Narciso feels for his warm, welcoming home that celebrates life, love, and their Cuban culture. Overall, the story is a beautiful testament to the power of family and heritage."
1211	13037	5	3	The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he elaborately talks about how he is extremely grateful that his parents were such caring and selfless people. They moved from their home country, Cuba, just for the sake of their children, leaving behind their familiar surroundings and starting anew. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing on all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Examples are him talking about how all the cultures in his area got along well with one another, creating a harmonious and inclusive environment. He also talked about the wonderful times he had with his parents in the kitchen, filled with laughter and delicious food. The memoir he left was definitely a positive one, not a negative one, leaving the readers with a warm and heart - warming feeling.
1212	13038	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is full of love and happiness. When Narciso is talking about his mother and father, he tenderly starts to talk about how they always loved and cared whole - heartedly. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This clearly shows that the whole house was filled with love because of Narciso's parents, who put their hearts into creating a loving atmosphere. Also, the way Narciso talks about his parents with deep affection shows that he loved his parents dearly. This also showed happiness because since he would never forget his home, it must've been an incredibly nice place to live. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This shows that the house was full of happiness and warmth, as family and friends gathered together, sharing joy and creating precious memories. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is truly full of love and happiness, which touches the readers' hearts."
1213	13039	5	3	The mood created by the author is outstanding. The mood is nice and warm - hearted. The author vividly talks about how the heart of the home is in the kitchen; and how Cuban music is always playing, with its lively rhythms filling the air, which sets a happy, cheerful mood. Then, the author mentions how their home is always open and welcoming to family and friends, with the door always ajar and a warm smile waiting for guests. This sets a warm, loving mood. Finally, the author talks about the Cuban feasts, with a variety of delicious dishes on the table, and close relatives he has. After reading the story, you feel like part of the family, as if you can smell the food and hear the laughter in that warm home.
1214	13040	5	3	Narciso creates a mood that shows family ties and unity within his community. By showing the way that each member of the community is willing to readily help each other, whether it's lending a hand with daily chores or offering emotional support, it gives a positive and friendly mood to the memoir. Also, he shows how members of the community treat each other as family regardless of race or ethnicity. People greet each other with warm smiles and share their joys and sorrows. This gives the memoir a loving and accepting mood to it, making the readers feel the strong sense of community and belonging.
1215	13041	5	3	Throughout this memoir, a very important mood is portrayed, and that is thankfulness. Throughout this memoir, Narciso shows great thankfulness towards his parents and how they gave up everything in the country they loved, Cuba, in order for their kids to have more opportunities and to have a better life. They left behind their relatives, friends, and the familiar streets of Cuba. Also, in this memoir, it talked about his parents making the best of what they do have and always helping people in their community, hoping that they would return the favor if needed. In their neighborhood, all the races were together in unity despite the customs elsewhere, creating a unique and inclusive community. In @LOCATION1, his parents struggled both personally and financially. They had to accept that they might not get the jobs they deserve, facing discrimination and difficulties, but they did it all for their kids. They had to endure the tough times for the better of their kids. Narciso has thanked his parents repeatedly for their love and sacrifice, but in reality, he says there is no way to fully express his gratitude. Narciso said he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home, with love and hard work. His parents' perseverance is the basis of his life today, which has taught him great lessons about love, sacrifice, and the importance of family.
1216	13042	5	3	The mood created by the author, I believe, was one of contentment and cheerfulness. The story refrained from discussing any negative events; instead, it focused on happiness and how parents raised their children independently, without any external assistance. It also described how the children felt when they grew up, expressing their happiness and pride. Overall, the positive tone of the story indicates that the author was in a good mood while writing it.
1217	13043	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound pride. This is evident as he expresses sincere thanks for all the valuable lessons he learned during his childhood, which he holds dear and is genuinely proud of. One clear example of this pride is when the author elaborately talks about his Cuban heritage and his enduring love for Cuban music. He is also extremely proud of his parents' courageous decision to immigrate to the @LOCATION1 to build a better life for him. Moreover, he takes pride in the fact that, despite the diverse backgrounds of the neighbors in the neighborhood, everyone accepted one another harmoniously. Another reason for his pride is that his parents were so generous as to offer many people a place to stay in their home. The author is most deeply proud of his parents because of their boundless love and great sacrifice. They were loving towards all and sacrificed a great deal to reach the position they were in. In conclusion, the mood of the author in the memoir is unmistakably one of great pride in what his parents have accomplished.
1218	13044	5	3	The author of the memoir was writing about a young boy who grew up in @LOCATION1 and held a deep affection for his first home. The central theme of this story is that happiness can be cultivated and preserved in a particular place. The boy in the story was extremely happy about how his parents attentively took care of him and provided him with a safe and nurturing environment to grow up in. He sincerely said that home is where one can truly feel genuinely happy and would desire to stay there for the rest of one's life. This clearly shows that a loving home can be a source of lasting happiness.
1219	13045	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is a blend of relaxation, happiness, and thankfulness. Narciso skillfully makes their home feel peaceful and relaxed. The statement ""a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood - related"" clearly shows that @CAPS1 is extremely happy with his household and the life that @CAPS1 shares with all of his ""family."" @CAPS1 is very thankful for his parents. They gave up their lives in Cuba to come to @LOCATION1, providing him with a good life. As @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This emphasizes the deep - seated gratitude and the positive mood that permeates the memoir."
1220	13046	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful as the author remembers his childhood home, his family life that encompasses his neighbors and extended family. Narciso Rodriguez masterfully creates a feeling of being at home and being surrounded by people you love. He elaborately explains how his first friend was his babysitter, the person who lived above him. Since his real grandparents were still in Cuba, his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents, filling the void in his life. He also creates a mood of helplessness when it comes to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle for jobs that were not commensurate with their abilities. His parents, as he said, ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" He firmly believes that this self - sacrifice is one of the main reasons his childhood house was transformed into a warm and loving home. In conclusion, the memoir is filled with a complex mix of remorse, love, and appreciation for the sacrifices made by his parents and the community that surrounded him."
1221	13047	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez vividly describes his loving family and carefully creates an appreciative, loving, and homey, comforting mood for the reader. Through his heartfelt words, the author sincerely thanks his parents for their kind and loving actions. This expression of gratitude makes the reader naturally feel admiration towards his parents, and the author is clearly trying to create a strong sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents in the readers' hearts. In paragraph @NUM1, the author elaborately explains his deep appreciation for his parents; ""But in reality, there's no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such an early age and demonstration of how Important friends and family really are."" The author is also skillfully trying to create a comforting mood. When he vividly explains the warm atmosphere of his home, he is effectively trying to create a homey mood; ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is extremely comforting and greatly adds to the homey mood. The author is also earnestly trying to create a loving mood in the sense that he is detailedly explaining the caring acts of his parents. In paragraph @NUM3, the author describes his generous parents, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to... many people... I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 - @NUM1). This shows the remarkable generosity of his parents, and the author is successfully trying to create a loving mood. @ORGANIZATION1 effectively develops a grateful, comforting, caring mood."
1222	13048	5	3	"The mood that the author was trying to create was a strong sense of hope, family, and happiness. Hope was clearly evident because his family selflessly helped others by kindly letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on their feet, which provided a glimmer of hope for the extended family. Family was prominently emphasized because in the last paragraph, he is tenderly explaining how in this tiny apartment, you truly learned the real - definition of ""family"" through warmly welcoming refugees, joyfully celebrating his first birthdays, and having a loving, caring environment. Finally, I think happiness was strongly conveyed because he was sincerely explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to America to give him a better life. Also, in paragraph two, he was vividly explaining how his home environment was filled with the delicious aroma of cooking and the lively sounds of music, which can be significant factors of happiness. These are some of the distinct moods that the author was trying to show."
1223	13049	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" (who is also the author) is writing about his life - changing experience. The mood of the poem is undeniably happy. His parents immigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1956. When he was growing up, he whole - heartedly learned all Cuban traditions and deeply envied them all. He's extremely proud of his parents for the bold risk that they took for him. This is precisely why the mood of the story is happy, as it reflects the positive impact his parents' decision had on his life."
1224	13050	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy, and a sense of family are artfully created by the author. Immediately as I began to read, I felt deeply comforted by the author's detailed writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he vividly talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues to share his story, you cannot help but develop a strong sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood gradually darkens. The author solemnly talks about the great hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life. I solemnly read on and was filled with a profound sense of family. ""I'll always be grateful to my parents,"" the author writes. ""for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He sincerely explains how much he appreciates the love and care given to him by his family. While reading this memoir, I have felt comforted, sympathetic, and a strong sense of family, as I'm sure the author had too, which makes the memoir a truly moving piece."
1225	13051	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez was calm and loving. @CAPS1 creates this mood by tenderly explaining a loving family, new friendships, and an overall welcoming feeling. To begin with, in a certain paragraph, Narciso Rodriguez states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote creates a calm and loving mood because it clearly explains that the author whole - heartedly enjoyed his childhood and deeply loved his family who loved him back. @CAPS1 again warmly complements his family and the way @CAPS1 was raised in the first sentence in paragraph @NUM1, also creating a common loving mood. Next, at the end of paragraph @NUM1, Narciso Rodriguez explains the deep love @CAPS1 feels towards his friends when @CAPS1 states, ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 again shows the love towards his friends in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3. Showing love towards his friends creates a calm and loving mood. Lastly, the calm and loving mood was also created because of an overall welcoming feeling. In paragraph @NUM4, the author warmly welcomes the reader into his past by speaking about his childhood home that @CAPS1 loved. Also, in the last sentence in paragraph four, @CAPS1 explains the people his parents help stating, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This quote explains the act of welcoming people, thus creating the mood. Explaining a loving family, new friendships, and an overall welcoming feeling effectively create the calm and loving mood, created by the author."
1226	13052	5	3	The author creates a warm, happy, and grateful mood in the memoir. Here, the pure innocence of childhood, the joyous congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that brought both together formed the idyllic backdrop to life in our cozy and inviting home. In our neighborhood, despite different customs found elsewhere, all of these diverse cultures came together in great solidarity and true friendship. I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifice. There is simply no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity that was impressed upon me at such an early age and the powerful demonstration of how incredibly important family and friends are. It was in this simple yet charming house that my parents whole - heartedly welcomed other refugees to celebrate their new beginning in this country, and where I joyfully celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the comforting warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a traditional Cuban feast always filled the air not just with a delicious scent and lively music but also with life and love. It was where I truly learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house, its kind - hearted neighborhood, or the many valuable lessons I learned there about how to love. I will always cherish how my parents turned this simple house into a loving and forever home.
1227	13053	5	3	"The feeling in this article when it talks about family is one of deep love, serene peace, pure happiness, and sincere gratefulness. Narciso clearly understands that his parents left behind everything in Cuba for his sake. One can easily tell that his parents love him very much, and he is extremely grateful for that. In paragraph @NUM1 he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He has the fortunate opportunity to be born in @LOCATION1 and have a much better life. Narciso also learned that he could love someone who is not a blood relative because they could be his family too. There were numerous people that were like family to him. He loved them deeply, and they were all truly happy spending quality time with each other. In this memoir, the mood would most likely be described as a blend of happiness and love, which makes the story all the more heart - warming."
1228	13054	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir shows a kind - hearted community, a cautious yet caring nature, and remarkable courage. My first quote is ""...hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This quote vividly means that the mood of the community is kind and always ready to help. My second quote is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This quote indicates that his parents' mood was one of careful consideration and a willingness to do anything for people if they needed help. My third and last quote is ""My mother and father had came to this country with such courage."" This quote means that before they came to the United States, they had the bravery to face the unknown, and now they were determined to make it and achieve success. These three quotes serve as clear examples of the mood created by the author in the memoir, which collectively paint a picture of a community full of goodness and strength."
1229	13055	5	3	"The mood created by the author, I would say, is quite good. They are extremely grateful to their parents for everything. Family is of utmost importance in the excerpt. In paragraph @NUM1, where it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both"" is a beautiful explanation of how and why they are so grateful towards their family. The description evokes a sense of a wonderful and cherished childhood. In paragraph @NUM2, where it says ""growing up in this great environment instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This explains that being close to someone doesn't necessarily mean you are blood - related. It shows that the concept of family in this context is based on love and connection rather than just genetics. Overall, the mood in the excerpt is positive and centered around the value of family."
1230	13056	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author was predominantly one of happiness and celebration. The author constantly elaborates on how his home was an absolutely wonderful place and a truly happy environment to live in. One clear example was in paragraph @NUM1. It details the endless and exuberant celebrations and the countless joyous congregations of family and friends. This is obviously a happy and heart - warming thing to occur. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it describes the wonderful joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood. It was truly remarkable because at that time there was a great deal of trouble with segregation and racism. This harmonious coming - together created a happy and inclusive environment to live in compared to the many other towns that were plagued with horrible racism and segregation. Finally, in paragraph @NUM3 it talks about how their arms and doors were wide open to anyone who needed them. This not only allowed them to experience their own happiness but also enabled other people to share in that happiness. In this memoir, the mood created by the author is predominantly one of happiness and celebration, making it a truly uplifting read."
1231	13057	5	3	Nacisco was genuinely happy with what she had, even though she lived in poverty. She deeply loved her Cuban heritage, which she still adores to this day. She takes great pride in being a Cuban. In her house, she had warm and good - natured relations. Her neighbors were not just people next door but great companions. Her parents were extremely hard - working and always supported her whole - heartedly. Her family maintained a wonderful relationship with both family members and friends. She truly appreciated all that her parents had done for her. They selflessly gave up their careers and their beloved country to move to @LOCATION1 so that she could have a better life. Her friends and family, who were also refugees, would come to her house all the time. Her baby - sitter became her very first friend. In @LOCATION1, they joyously celebrated her first birthdays.

Her life will always be filled with the beautiful sounds of music and the comfort of love. So, even though she faced hard times, she still whole - heartedly appreciated what she had.
1232	13058	5	3	The mood the author created in this memoir is very happy and relaxed, with an open - hearted feel. It is very open because the text clearly states that they let anyone they consider family stay over for however long a period of time. They exude a happy and relaxed vibe because in paragraphs @NUM1, it seems that everyone is in a mellow state and extremely grateful to be in this country. They are overjoyed to have decent jobs and start new lives. This is the mood that the author skillfully weaves into the story. The author did an excellent job integrating these elements into the story to make it flow very smoothly, creating an engaging and pleasant reading experience.
1233	13059	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep gratitude and happiness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it specifically mentions that his parents had remarkable cooking skills, and then it clearly notes that he is very grateful. So, basically, he is extremely grateful that he had or has the chance to live as @CAPS1 and enjoy the opportunities that others don't have. He is also very, very happy that he didn't just live in a mere house. His parents, with their love and care, transformed it into a home filled with loving memories and precious family moments. This mood of gratitude and happiness pervades the entire memoir.
1234	13060	5	3	"The mood of the @CAPS1 of the text ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very thankful and happy. I can clearly tell this because in @CAPS2 @NUM1, it vividly shows how grateful @CAPS3 was to live in that house with his parents. And in @NUM2, it expresses in detail how much love Narciso had for his parents and how truly thankful @CAPS3 was. Finally, in @NUM3, the @CAPS1 tells the reader how @CAPS3 was thankful for immigrants giving their children a new beginning. These are clear ways you can tell the mood of the @CAPS1 in the text, which is a mood that warms the heart and shows the power of gratitude and happiness."
1235	13061	5	3	I think the mood was happy and @CAPS1. Because they @CAPS2 with determination. The boy deeply loved his parents. They had to leave their friends, some family members there, and they would surely miss them. However, the parents were resolute as they wanted a better life for their children. They were @CAPS1 about the decision to move, looking forward to the new opportunities that awaited them and their children in the new place.
1236	13062	5	3	The author created a warm and inviting mood of happiness and love. When Narciso Rodriguez was thoughtfully thinking back to the past, he deeply loved his home and his parents for the selfless things they did for him. The way he lived, filled with laughter and togetherness, reflected the mood of his house. It was a place that was free - spirited and welcoming. Just as his parents were kind and open - hearted to other immigrants, offering them a helping hand. Narciso Rodriguez's Cuban home was one of the most cherished things he cared about and he was truly grateful for it, as it was the source of so many wonderful memories.
1237	13063	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir was more of a homey - heart - touching mood that really pulled at the reader's emotions. To know that his family unhesitatingly helped other immigrants in their time of need, regardless of any culture, was really getting the point across about kindness and community. That where you live is just a structure of bricks and mortar until you fill it with love and make it a home, a place full of warmth and belonging.
1238	13064	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a genuinely happy mood. It is a happy mood because Narciso finally had a clear understanding of what family actually meant. For example, when Narciso says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This quote vividly shows the mood that Narciso had, which was one of pure happiness. In conclusion, Narciso had a happy mood because he finally grasped the real, profound definition of family, and that understanding brought him lasting joy."
1239	13065	5	3	In this @CAPS1, this is the mood I think the author is trying to carefully create. Well, I firmly think it's a happy mood. I believe this because he doesn't use any depressing words or expressions in his writing. Instead, his language is full of positivity. Also, he had a great family that supported and loved him. He had clearly stated that he whole - heartedly enjoyed his lifestyle and his home, which were the sources of his contentment. So, overall, the author successfully creates a happy mood in the text.
1240	13066	5	3	The memoir of the author was centered around his house as a kid. It described how the simple house was gradually made into a home for him and his family. Through shared meals, laughter, and the support of one another, the house transformed from a mere building into a place full of love and memories. It was a journey of turning four walls into a sanctuary, a place where the family bonded and grew. In the end, that house became a symbol of family and home for the author.
1241	13067	5	3	The author did an excellent job of bringing different moods into the memoir. There was a palpable sad mood, yet it was also punctuated with happy moments from time to time. When the happy mood prevailed, the memoir became even more enjoyable to read. The last sentence leaves people with the clear understanding that he wouldn't trade his experiences, as described in the memoir, for anything in the world. This shows the depth of his connection to those memories, whether they were sad or happy.
1242	13068	5	3	"Throughout this passage, there is a very happy and loving vibe that permeates every word. This is vividly shown in paragraph @NUM1, where it states, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in a warm home."" This paints a glorious picture of what daily life in the house was like, full of joy and togetherness. Another example in the text is at the end, in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" This clearly shows that with happiness and love, it does not matter how rich you are, or what you own. Anything can be transformed into a loving home, as long as there is that emotional connection."
1243	13069	5	3	It brings a genuinely happy mood that lingers and uplifts. It evokes a very warm feeling deep within you, making you feel cozy and content. It gives you an insightful understanding of how people used to live in the past. The family had an incredibly close relationship, almost like they were one big family with their friends. They loved to have people over to their house and would eagerly cook delicious meals for them. They even considered people who weren't really their grandparents as grandparents, showing the depth of their affection. He got to grow up in a very nice family environment and in a truly wonderful way. They spread love to all people they encountered, making their community a more caring and kind place.
1244	13070	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is distinctly happy and loving.

When she talked about her friends, she specifically mentioned Alegria, her neighbor, baby - sitter, and first friend. The author talks about how her parents were so welcoming that they let friends and family in so often that it formed a close - knit community where everyone genuinely cared and loved each other. This sense of community and love is what makes the memoir so heart - warming.
1245	13071	5	3	"In the memoir @PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a deeply thankful and gracious mood that is evident on every page. Talking about his parents immigrating, @PERSON1 says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote clearly shows his thanks because @PERSON1 is truly glad that his parents made the difficult decision to immigrate to give him a better life full of more opportunities. Another example of a gracious mood is in paragraph @NUM1, where he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @PERSON1 shows that he is extremely gracious for what his parents did and how much they whole - heartedly care about him. A final example of thanks is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family.'

As you can see from these examples, the memoir had a very strong and pervasive thankful and gracious mood to it, which leaves a lasting impression on the reader."
1246	13072	5	3	"The mood was calm, as if it was a truly wonderful place to be in, a place that would also make one feel like wanting to live there forever.

In paragraph @NUM1, it states ""... the many things I learned there about how to love,"" and also mentions ""... not just scent and music but life and love."" This clearly conveys the strong presence of the love mood. A second major mood in this memoir is warmth. In paragraph @NUM1, it describes ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen..."", evoking a sense of cozy comfort. And third, a major mood in this memoir is gratefulness and being grateful for what we have.

In the memoir, it is evident that Narciso thanked his parents repeatedly for all that they have done. He also states, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

The author is vividly explaining how their house was always open to anyone who ever needed help or simply wanted to come, which gives a very strong and inviting welcoming feeling. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

1252	13078	5	3	"In the memoir, the author skillfully creates a warm and loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the gentle and affectionate way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking, he paints a vivid picture. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis, with their sincere expressions, portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes. ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving one.

1253	13079	5	3	"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, I could vividly feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a deep - seated sense of love and gratitude for things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing with appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look. Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always present during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he deeply appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond and vivid memories of those times. Rodriguez then goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight - knit neighborhood, such as to whole - heartedly open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship."" At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the profound love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today. To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the most precious gift a parent can give their child."
1254	13080	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of being truly gratefull. The author carefully takes paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2 to fully explain his deep - seated gratitude to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). These are the @NUM5 main points from paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. The author is sincerely thanking his parents for the numerous amount of things they have done for him, and his gratitude is palpable. The author shows his gratitude throughout the excerpt, and this common mood always remains prominent. For instance, in @CAPS1 @NUM8 the author reminds the reader that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Or in @CAPS1 @NUM9 when he writes ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or courage."" As you can clearly see, the author constantly reminds the reader of how thankful/grateful he is to his parents. This effectively sets the mood of being grateful throughout the story, making the readers feel the author's heartfelt emotions."
1255	13081	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful. The mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author is looking back with fondness on how his parents turned a three - room apartment into a warm and inviting home. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 the author writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This strongly supports the mood of the memoir because the author is genuinely grateful to his parents for teaching him what a home really is, a place full of love and care. Also, the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author tells of how his community was like a big, loving family. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 the author writes ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the author is appreciative of the harmonious and inclusive atmosphere of the place that he grew up in. Another reason the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful is that the author deeply understands his parents' hardships. I know this because in paragraph @NUM3 the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the author truly appreciates the fact that his parents gave up so much to make a better life for him. The mood of the memoir is shown in many ways, making it a touching and heart - warming read."
1256	13082	5	3	The author felt happy that she was born in the U.S.A. But she loved her Cuban heritage, which was an integral part of her identity and brought a unique flavor to her life.
1257	13083	5	3	"In the memoir, written by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is clearly one of togetherness. There are indeed many other words that could potentially describe the mood, but togetherness best encapsulates the essence of the family as a whole. The parents were incredibly open - hearted and accepted almost anybody into their home; they were very welcoming, making guests feel right at home. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Hospitality could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family regularly invited their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly in their interactions. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also vividly shows the togetherness within the family. The fact that the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in a new and unfamiliar place. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" Despite these challenges, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times, which is truly inspiring."
1258	13084	5	3	"I think the mood the author is trying to convey is one of thankfulness, satisfaction, and the feeling that he is loved. An example of his deep - seated satisfaction is ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the beautiful backdrop to life in our home."" This paints a picture of a content and fulfilling childhood. And an example of his thankfulness is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today..."" This shows his gratitude for the valuable gifts his parents bestowed upon him. And lastly, an example of him being loved is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This indicates the strong sense of love and belonging he felt. I can clearly tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents them well in his writing."
1259	13085	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is a very happy and grateful mood. It is happy because in paragraph 3 it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This paints a vivid picture of a joy - filled childhood. It is grateful because he says in paragraph 5 ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it means leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This shows his understanding and appreciation of his parents' sacrifices. In paragraph 7 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This direct statement further emphasizes the grateful mood. This is the mood created in this excerpt, which leaves a lasting impression on the reader."
1260	13086	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood throughout his memoir. He wrote in great detail about his wonderful home and close - knit family. He vividly showed how happy everyone was to be together, and it seemed as if nothing could go wrong in that idyllic setting. Narciso tells how his parents selflessly sacrificed everything in Cuba for him, leaving behind their homeland, friends, and familiar surroundings. The whole neighborhood was tight - knit, and the residents loved and supported each other like one big family. Family was definitely a huge and central part of Narciso's life, and he effectively expressed that with his heartfelt writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"", filled with the rich cultural heritage of Cuba. By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant and full of warmth. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his wonderful family and home memories, making the reader feel as if they are a part of that loving world."
1261	13087	5	3	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the overall mood while reading could be aptly described as grateful. I can clearly sense this mood through some of the specific things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. Throughout the memoir, the author would constantly and sincerely say ""thank you"" to his parents for all the sacrifices they had to make to provide a suitable living environment for Narciso. It also explicitly states that ""there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Overall, in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage, and home, which is a sentiment that permeates every page of the narrative."
1262	13088	5	3	"The mood of the author underwent a notable change during the memoir. In the beginning of the story, he had a mood of simply telling where the character was from and where he was born, presenting a rather matter - of - fact tone. On paragraph @NUM1, he adopts a ""I'll do what it takes"" mood. For example, he was deeply grateful about his parents and his life, and he was content with how things were and truly loved it. On paragraph @NUM2 and seven, the author clearly feels relieved and happy as he writes about the character vividly remembering the good old times, which brings a warm and nostalgic feeling to the narrative."
1263	13089	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives"", the mood created by the author in the memoir is one of loving, happiness, and gratefulness. There are many instances showing the mood in the article. For instance, one of the moods, ""grateful"", is shown in para @NUM1. The text states: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly indicates that he loves them unconditionally, whether the circumstances are good or bad. Another example of the mood of gratefulness is in para six, where he expresses his gratitude to his parents by saying ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I thanked them repeatedly."" Moreover, he does it with love, which is another prominent mood in the article. Those are the moods created by the author in the memoir, as evident in the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The @CAPS1 of Our Lives""."
1264	13090	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood that the author created was a combination of grateful, courageous, and generosity. First in the memoir, the first mood that the author created is grateful. The author specifically states that ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This means he was extremely excited and happy that his parents passed down these skills to him instead of other family members, which is why he is so grateful. Next, his second mood is courageous because of his family. The author states that ""I often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This means that all the times he had been with his mother or his dad, they supported him through the difficulties of his education and work. Lastly, his final mood was generosity because of his experiences when he was young. The author states that ""there is no way to express my spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" This implies that his mother always relied on him to do all the work around the house and in the yard. All in all, in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"", the mood that the author had in the memoir was grateful, courageous, and generosity, which are all integral parts of the story's emotional fabric."
1265	13091	5	3	The @CAPS1 reveals a lot of his personal experiences in the story. The @CAPS1 creates a mood that makes the reader deeply think about themselves and their family. He vividly talks about his family and his childhood, sharing details of when he was a boy and where he grew up. The @CAPS1 also elaborately spoke about his parents and their life. He further describes how he and his parents lived in a neighborhood with immigrants. The @CAPS1 expresses how difficult it is for him and his parents to leave without the rest of their family, highlighting the strong sense of family bond. Additionally, the @CAPS1 talks about how he has a deep love for music and how he loves his parents as well. His parents provided him with help and hope during challenging times. He also uses music to symbolize his life, adding a rich layer of meaning to his story. Now, he has become a successful fashion designer, which is a testament to his journey and the influence of his family and experiences.
1266	13092	5	3	The mood created by the author was a deep - seated pride of being Cuban. This pride stemmed from the rich heritage that the entire family shared, a heritage full of traditions and values. And the author was truly grateful towards her parents and family, who had preserved and passed down this precious heritage through the years.
1267	13093	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a bustling, busy area of New Jersey that was filled with people of all nationalities. It was this diverse melting pot of people and the unwavering hard work of his parents that shaped who he is today.  The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, clearly exemplified by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the numerous sacrifices and the arduous hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him. As Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took on a huge endeavor by going to the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and courage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community. As the author writes: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity within the community definitely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and optimism."
1268	13094	5	3	The author of the memoir created a mood that was intense, strange, a blend of happy and sad. It was happy because they transformed a simple house into a warm and inviting home, filled with memories and love. It was sad because it is always hard to leave something that holds so many emotions and experiences behind. The mood was intense because moving on from such a place and situation is a difficult and challenging process. Lastly, it was strong because the author was strong enough to leave that behind even though it was extremely hard. This complex mood gives the memoir a depth and authenticity that resonates with the reader.
1269	13095	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very luring. It's like once you read one sentence, you're immediately drawn in and want to read more. In the story, she describes how her parents have to start their lives all over again from scratch. But then she also mentions that they're just happy to be together in good old @LOCATION1. The story conveys the message that just because you have very little material possessions, it doesn't mean you can't live life to the fullest. The idea that one should be happy with what they've got, or else they'll end up having nothing at all, is what this story is telling me in my mind. So, I will follow my life to the best, just like Narciso and her family did, embracing the joys of simplicity and togetherness.
1270	13096	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was mellow because he's reflectively talking about his life and expressing his deep - seated gratefulness to have been raised in @LOCATION1. A place that was filled with countless memories and experiences. Also, the mood was happy, because he said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" which is him fondly talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like a true haven, a place full of love and security. These are the prominent moods of the story, which leave the reader with a sense of contentment and appreciation."
1271	13097	5	3	The author who penned the memoir crafted a warm and inviting cozy home feeling, which effectively made the reader experience the same sentiment. By a cozy home feeling, I mean that the author vividly showed how Narciso and his family interacted. They got along well and were always ready to help, whether it was family members, friends, or simply people who just needed a little bit of assistance. This sense of community and support truly added to the charm of the memoir.
1272	13098	5	3	The author's mood towards the memoir seemed to be just okay, I guess. In certain areas of the memoir, the author's enthusiasm seemed low, and it felt like there was a lack of that extra spark. Overall, it could have been better, perhaps with more passion and engagement shown in the writing.
1273	13099	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood deliberately created by Narciso was one of pure happiness. I can confirm this through the following three clear - cut reasons. One way I know the mood was happiness is when the article specifically stated, ""There was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" This vividly showed how Narciso was genuinely happy that his parents were so kind and very caring towards others. Another way the mood was happiness is when the article said, ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood."" This reveals how he was overjoyed to discover a more profound and meaningful definition of family during his stay at the house. The last way the mood was happiness is when the article mentioned, ""My mother and father had come to the country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, they came selflessly."" Narciso clearly showed happiness because his parents managed to make it through such a big and challenging change in their lives. All these instances clearly demonstrate how the mood being created was ""happiness"". His parents are truly wonderful people, and their actions were a source of great joy for Narciso."
1274	13100	5	3	"The mood in the memoir represents core values like friendship, family, and helpfulness. One clear example of helpfulness is in the @NUM1 paragraph, where it states, ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the selflessness and helpful nature within the community. A good example of the mood in this memoir that combines family and helpfulness is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family. Knowing that they would do the same for us."" This not only highlights the strong sense of family but also how helping others is an integral part of it. This is what the memoir is all about, a beautiful blend of community, family, and support."
1275	13101	5	3	They were sad during some parts of this memoir. The first reason for their sadness was that they had to leave their families behind. They also had to bid farewell to the country of Cuba and say goodbye to their friends as well. However, they were also happy. The reason is that they found themselves in a Spanish, Cuban, and @CAPS1 community. This made them feel as if they were right at home, surrounded by familiar culture and people. But they were also frustrated because they would have to start their lives over from scratch. They would have to search for new jobs and figure out new transportation options. Despite the challenges, the sense of community provided some comfort in the midst of all the changes.
1276	13102	5	3	The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood, filled with a sense of anticipation. This is because the family was extremely excited about moving to a new place that offered better opportunities for growth and had excellent educational facilities. It also transformed a regular house into a special home for them as they frequently had guests over, and these repeated gatherings led to the guests eventually becoming like family. The neighbors also played a part in creating the mood by refraining from any negative actions or violence, and the author placed the family's location in a non - American neighborhood where a sense of community prevailed. All these elements combined to sustain the happy and exciting mood throughout the narrative.
1277	13103	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is kind and loving, creating a heart - warming atmosphere. It showed kindness in paragraph @NUM1, where the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and inviting. He did this by carefully using words like ""innocence"", which painted a pure picture, ""celebrations"", which brought a sense of joy, and ""warm home"", which gave a feeling of comfort, to create the feel of kindness. Love was prominently shown when the author told about the way his parents whole - heartedly welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they ""got back on their feet."" This shows love because when you are welcomed without any regard for the problem you may have or who you are, it demonstrates a selfless and all - encompassing love to everyone. In conclusion, the kindness and love described in the memoir make it a touching read."
1278	13104	5	3	"When you have a loving family and a beautiful home filled with warmth and comfort, you should be very grateful. Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful, and this gratefulness shines through in his story. The overall mood of Narciso's story is one of profound gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. His memoir explains in detail how he is grateful for everything. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" he would often say. He would always tell his parents about his deep admiration for their strength and perseverance in the face of difficulties. His family cared for everybody with an open heart and ""Always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" All in all, the memoir's mood is clearly one of gratefulness because Narciso was genuinely and deeply grateful for everything he had in his life."
1279	13105	5	3	The mood of the memoir is that he is growing up in the house with his Mother and father, surrounded by a loving and caring environment. His parents are always ready to give a helping hand to people who need it. One explanation is when his parents moved here, leaving all of their friends and family behind in hopes to make a better life for him. They took a big risk and made a huge sacrifice for his future. Another is showing him about his culture through music that carried the rhythm of their homeland, cooking that filled the house with delicious scents, celebrations that were full of traditions, and taking care of other people, which taught him the value of kindness. His parents let people stay at their home when they need to get on their feet, providing a safe haven. And by always having people over for dinner (Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, @CAPS1 etc...), they created a sense of community and togetherness. In conclusion, the memoir captures the essence of a warm and culturally rich upbringing.
1280	13106	5	3	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this memoir, a feeling that permeates every page. But the biggest feeling of all is love. His parents went all the way from Cuba, enduring a long and arduous journey, just to give @CAPS2 a better life. Even if it meant leaving their well - established jobs, close - knit family, and dear friends all behind just to give their son a brighter future. Also, after they arrived, they lived in a cramped one - room apartment for a year, making the best of the limited space. Then they moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"", carefully infusing it with the essence of their homeland so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso when he was born. Even after that, they were still kind - hearted and had open arms for other immigrants, offering them support and a sense of belonging. So I absolutely think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love that is both selfless and far - reaching."
1281	13107	5	3	"The author creates mood in the memoir in several ways. In one instance, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This is an example because it indicates that in certain environments, everyone can feel like family. In another part, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifices."" This serves as an example as he truly appreciates all that his parents did for him and will continue to do so. In conclusion, these are the ways the author effectively creates a mood in the memoir."
1282	13108	5	3	"The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir. The way he carefully worded things such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" vividly showed how extremely happy he was toward his parents. He elaborately told us how deeply grateful he was for his parents being so self - less and always thinking about him first. He also makes it abundantly clear how he is immensely proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the wonderful things they did to significantly improve his life. Also, he shows how he sincerely admires his parents' hard work and bravery for the challenges they overcame. In conclusion, his overall mood, I think, is his profound gratitude toward his parents, which shines through every word of the memoir."
1283	13109	5	3	The author was in a respectful mood. In the memoir, it details a lot about how his parents tenderly took care of him and about his life and how his parents patiently helped him through difficult times. So when the author wrote this, he was in a somewhat happy mood because he fondly looked back on all the good times. However, looking back on those memories can also bring a tinge of sadness, as the past is gone. In conclusion, the author's mood is a complex blend of respect, happiness, and a bit of sadness as he reflects on his life with his parents.
1284	13110	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez describes his life amidst the hardships and selflessness of his humble and caring parents. The moods created by this author are happy and light - hearted, inspired by his deep love and profound gratefulness. Narciso views his parents as true saviors, who unreservedly sacrificed everything to provide a better life for their children. He is eternally grateful for their courageous acts that brought him incredible opportunities in Miami. He fondly looks back happily at the warm and comfortable atmosphere of his home, filled with love and laughter. He is greatly thankful for his Cuban heritage that his family instilled in him at a young age. The unity of his close - knit community taught him honesty and the importance of hard work. Narciso exudes love and a strong sense of pride in his incredible and hospitable family through his writing. Setting a mood of gratefulness and a true admiration for parents who taught him important life lessons he will never forget, his memoir is a beautiful tribute to his family.
1285	13111	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy mood. The author's parents selflessly gave up everything to come to Miami for their soon - to - be child. They did that so that he could have a high - quality education, and for that, he is very grateful. The author loved his home deeply and had wonderful times there. It is his most favorite place in the whole world, and that is why he describes his home in great detail, from the layout of the rooms to the little decorations. The author had great family memories in the kitchen with the lively Cuban music playing and the enticing scent of Cuban food filling the air. The author's mood is grateful because of what his parents did for him by moving to Miami. It is also happy because of all the great times he had there. The author would probably want to relive those times, just as many of us want to relive the precious times of our childhood. In conclusion, the author's memoir is a celebration of his happy past and his gratitude towards his parents.
1286	13112	5	3	"The mood created by the author is that he is fondly remembering the old days, reflecting on how he used to live and how deeply he admires his family, especially his parents. He made the journey to the United States in 1956. In 1961, he was born into a simple, cozy house. The mood of the author is that he greatly admires his parents for their determination to give their children a better life. They left behind their families, friends, and established careers in the country they loved, all for the sake of their children. The author will always be deeply grateful to his parents for their boundless love and self - sacrifice. He has ""thanked them repeatedly"". Therefore, the mood that the author predominantly shows is a profound love for his parents, family, friends, and Cuba. He not only thanks but also learns from his parents for all they did to support their children, regardless of the sacrifices they had to make."
1287	13113	5	3	The author's mood that is created in the memoir is one of warm love and sincere gratitude. The author vividly expresses how incredibly thankful he is to his parents for the wonderful home they created, where he lived and grew up. He emphasizes that he knows family is not just about blood relations. He tells stories of how his parents had open arms and open doors to those in the community who were in need of help. Their home was always filled with lively @CAPS1 music, delicious food, and an abundance of love. They would hold joyous celebrations for his birthdays and for people's arrivals in the new country. There was a special, heart - warming atmosphere of love and thankfulness throughout his life, and this is beautifully expressed in this memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
1288	13114	5	3	The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is truly grateful for what he has in his life. @PERSON1 is deeply appreciative of his parents' decision to arrive in @LOCATION1. He has a great passion for cooking Cuban food and listening to Cuban music, which reminds him of his roots. The mood, I think, also shows that @PERSON1 is most grateful to his parents for their bravery in coming to @LOCATION1. He is extremely thankful for his parents' love and the sacrifices they made. @PERSON1 says he will never forget the way his parents transformed a simple, ordinary house into a warm and loving home, a place filled with memories and love.
1289	13115	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir would be a blend of gratefulness and happiness. It really makes you pause and think about life and how wonderful it can be, all thanks to the efforts of parents, grandparents, and even ancestors. It makes you feel an even stronger love for your parents when you see how much they went through and probably gave up for you. Just like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr, who left their homeland and gave up great things for their family or son. They desired a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave the place where they were born and raised, and give up their well - established jobs and the skills they had mastered. It was a difficult decision, but they did it to gain better things. The good outcome is that they got more freedom, a better life, and better education. It's never easy to leave everything you love and your birthplace, but it has to be done for the sake of better opportunities. Reading this memoir leaves you with a complex set of emotions - a satisfying, grateful, happy, and yet a bit sad mood, as you understand the sacrifices made.
1290	13116	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a very comforting one. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, gently mixing with the inviting aromas wafting from the Kitchen."" This description evokes a strong sense of home, of spending precious time with the ones you love. It makes you feel that warm, cozy feeling deep inside, and one can't help but wonder, is it not truly comforting to have such memories and a sense of belonging? It leaves the reader with a lingering feeling of comfort and contentment."
1291	13117	5	3	The mood that was created by the @CAPS1 is that regardless of whether you're an immigrant or not, you can still make friends and have a loving family by your side. You can forge new friendships and cherish the bonds you've formed. Another mood that he talks about is his parents, who love to cook together with great enthusiasm and are also self - less in their actions. These aspects combine to create a warm and inclusive atmosphere in the described context.
1292	13118	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is distinctly happy and warm. This is primarily due to the strong and caring relationships vividly talked about in the memoir. As stated, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sentiment at @CAPS1 is the core of the story that is being discussed. In the story, he talks about being around ""family"" who aren't blood relatives; they are simply people who can bring a great deal of happiness to a person. At @CAPS2, the memoir makes the reader happier because the author is writing about the happy memories he'll never forget. Although the events described were simple, the author infused a lot of deep emotions that were effectively portrayed in the story, which gave the story a deeper and more resonant mood. Overall, the memoir leaves a lasting impression of warmth and joy."
1293	13119	5	3	The mood in this memoir is one of happiness because she was extremely delighted that her parents had moved to a bigger apartment than the one they previously had. This new and more spacious living environment brought a sense of comfort and excitement. She was also happy that the landlord's daughter was very kind - hearted and always took the time to set the table for them. Sometimes, her aunt and cousins would come over and enjoy meals at the table together, creating a lively and convivial atmosphere. He explained that the landlord's daughter was his first friend and also served as his babysitter. Their friendship was filled with joy and created many happy moments. This collection of positive experiences contributed to the overall happy mood of the memoir.
1294	13120	5	3	The mood created by the author is evident in how Narciso is deeply and genuinely grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. His gratitude is palpable as he reflects on the unwavering love they have shown him throughout his life and the sacrifices they have made for his well - being. This sense of appreciation forms the core of the mood in the narrative, making it a touching and heartfelt account.
1295	13121	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving, caring, and heartwarming. The memoir had a loving mood because the author elaborately talks about friends and family and emphasizes how incredibly important loved ones are. In the selection, it said, ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our home."" This description paints a picture of a close - knit and affectionate community. Also, the author creates a caring mood throughout the story, especially in his relationship with his parents. For example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open,"" which shows their open - hearted and welcoming nature, and ""I will always be grateful to my parents,"" which expresses his deep - seated appreciation. The author also creates a heartwarming mood in the memoir when he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These instances effectively convey the various moods created by the author in the memoir, leaving the reader with a feeling of warmth and affection."
1296	13122	5	3	The mood in the story is a warm and happy one. As the main character was growing up, he had a strong and wonderful sense of family. He states that his relatives usually join them for dinner, creating a lively and joyous atmosphere. He loves his parents deeply because they always had their arms open wide to any type of relative, making the family gatherings even more special. Lastly, the author was truly thankful because his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to make his life better, which shows the great love and sacrifice within the family.
1297	13123	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a comforting one. In chapter @NUM1, it vividly talks about the overall feelings of love and care that surrounded the Rodriguez household, much like a soft and warm comfy blanket. It also mentions how the ""congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both"" helped pave a smooth road for a great childhood. There were many friends and family members who were always there for Narciso Rodriguez to rely on. Another example of the comfort within the Rodriguez home is that the ""parents always kept their arms and door open wide to many of the people... considered family, knowing that they would do the same"". This portrays an overall image of a harmonious community where everyone got along well and helped each other out. Last but not least, Narciso's home was ""always filled... (with) life and love"", where he felt completely secure and well - cared for. All in all, the household that @PERSON2 lived in was a household filled with love, care and especially comfort that every child should have."
1298	13124	5	3	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez clearly sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is elaborately describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a really good feel of how his parents genuinely cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". When he says this, it is another instance where he is telling us he is deeply grateful for his family. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times when he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which effectively sets a positive mood."
1299	13125	5	3	"There are many ways the mood was created by the author in the memoir. One way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was through the author's past memories. An example of this was ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air"". This strongly supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because this cultural music came directly from the author's memories, which in turn sets the mood. Another way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's opinions of the memories. An example of this was in paragraph @NUM1 ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)"". This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because the author expressed their opinions in their own sincere way which set the mood."
1300	13126	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, a specific mood is clearly shown. The mood from this is a combination of happiness and satisfaction. The family is extremely happy because they got a new and cozy home, they have a lovely child, and they made really good friends from the neighborhood. The satisfaction part is also quite evident when they are satisfied with what they have, like a stable job, a comfortable home, a loving family, great friends, and they are making a decent amount of money. After all, moods depend on your surroundings, like the kind - hearted people around you rather than the merchandise. And that's all that truly matters in creating a positive and fulfilling atmosphere."
1301	13127	5	3	"By reading the memoir, I know that a family isn't just a family because they are blood relatives. A family is about loving each other and always being there for one another. The author is grateful for everything his parents have done. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly shows the deep - seated bond and appreciation within the family."
1302	13128	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is @CAPS1. Narciso Rodriguez, who was born and raised in a Cuban family, values everything his family ever did for him. As stated in @CAPS2 @NUM1 of this passage, he ""is eternally @CAPS3 for all that his family has done, whether it was the delicious @CAPS4 Cuban food they cooked for him or the lively Cuban music they made him listen to."" Growing up in a multi - racial community made him accustomed to being a non - segregated individual. The mood he sets when narrating this is @CAPS1 because, not once did he ever take life for granted. ""I will always be grateful for what my parents showed within love and sacrifice. Telling them often for what they have done was more courageous than I could have ever reached"" shows his profound respect and gratitude."
1303	13129	5	3	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez is a loving, caring, thoughtful feeling which originated from his childhood home. In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"", it states ""A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote vividly shows how much love and care are present, making the mood a more loving and thoughtful one. In the passage, it also says ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In this quote, I felt the mood of love, and the author inquires it with his word choice. Also, in the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"", it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote signifies all three moods: loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was, and the meanings behind it. The mood of the story is touching, with all the warmth of love brought into the house, rather than caring about possessions with greed, highlighting the true essence of family and home."
1304	13130	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is about how he was living with his family in the house. The specific relevant part in the story says ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebration"". This shows what he wants to convey about how he lived with many people around him. He is an immigrant, and this description reflects his unique experience of family life in a new place, full of joy and togetherness. It gives a clear picture of the warm and inclusive environment he was a part of."
1305	13131	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" This statement shows that Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In this memoir, the mood is not just thoughtful, kind, or caring; it's the feeling of being loved and loving in return. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This quote sums up the entire mood, emphasizing that the family environment in the memoir is a place where true love and understanding are found, leaving a lasting and heart - warming impression."
1306	13132	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood he carefully crafted is one of deep - seated gratitude. First and foremost, he is sincerely grateful to his family. For instance, he poignantly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM1). From this heartfelt statement, you can truly understand the profound appreciation he holds for what his parents have selflessly given him. Next, Narciso is extremely grateful for being part of such a warm and caring family. He states, ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@NUM1). This quote clearly explains how much his family instilled in him the virtue of being kind. Finally, he is grateful to have known such wonderful people. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbors, or the many things I learned there about how to love"" (@NUM3). To sum it all up, the mood Narciso Rodriguez created for his memoir is a powerful and lasting sense of gratitude."
1307	13133	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this poignant memoir would be a profound sense of thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1 wrote this memoir as a heartfelt tribute to his parents. He wanted to portray that even though most people might assume that he had a tough life, he firmly and completely disagrees. He clearly realizes that his parents made all the sacrifices they did so that @PERSON1 would have a better and more fulfilling life. He deeply appreciates the fact that his parents always had an open - hearted approach, making anyone who came into their lives feel like they were an integral part of the family. They were truly loving, caring, and heartwarming people. Just as @PERSON1 said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"", which perfectly encapsulates the wonderful impact his parents had on his life."
1308	13134	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood is very strongly one of gratitude. All throughout the story, the author consistently kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their remarkable selflessness and tender care. This mood is most vividly shown in paragraph @NUM1 because he repeatedly and earnestly thanks his parents for making the brave decision to move to the United States from Cuba to support him when he was born. He expresses his gratitude for them leaving behind their friends, close - knit family, and well - established jobs to help him, even though the new jobs they managed to get in the new country are not commensurate with their skills and what they truly deserve. So, as you can clearly see, the author is very deeply grateful to his parents, which makes this overwhelming sense of gratitude the predominant mood of the memoir."
1309	13135	5	3	The author said that he had never laid eyes on his real grandfather until they were finally allowed to leave Cuba. That significant event took place in the @DATE1. After that, they were able to reunite their whole family in New Jersey, the place where they had long - desired to live. This move to New Jersey brought about a new chapter in their lives, allowing them to be together as a complete family unit.
1310	13136	5	3	"I think that the mood created by the speaker is a genuine and strong sense of gratitude. I think this because his parents ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This clearly shows that he deeply appreciates his parents for passing on their valuable cooking skills. Another telling example of when Narciso is thankful is when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This is because they made the difficult decision to give up their jobs of working in a laboratory and in chemical engineering to improve his life. All these instances demonstrate that the speaker was creating a tone of sincere and unwavering gratefulness."
1311	13137	5	3	"In the memoir in ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1, the overall mood of the stories is undeniably happy. The reason it's happy becomes evident if you listen closely to the tone in which she shares her experiences. ""I was born into a simple house situated in a two - family, blonde brick building in the *** section of Newark, New Jersey. My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Here, @CAPS1 sounds genuinely happy to be Cuban; it's an integral part of what @CAPS1 is. That essence of Cuban identity and the warm home her parents built contribute to the happy mood of the memoir. Another reason it's happy is when @CAPS1 says, ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood."" @CAPS1 clearly cares deeply about his family, and the values and experiences his parents showed him have left a lasting positive impression. That's why the overall mood of the memoir remains a happy one. In the memoir ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1, the overall mood of the memoir is happy, filled with the joy of family and cultural identity."
1312	13138	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood that is carefully created by the author is a loving and grateful mood towards the author's parents. A clear example from the memoir is when the author openly talks about his profound gratefulness toward his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM1). This poignant quote shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful toward his parents because he explicitly mentions his deep - seated gratefulness towards them. Another telling example is when the author tells the reader that his parents showed him two important lessons that he chose as the basis of his life. ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote clearly shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful towards his parents because the author tells the reader that what they did helped him become a better person. Lastly, when the author tells the reader that he is grateful for the fact that his parents selflessly gave up their life in Cuba to make his life better. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (paragraph @NUM3). This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful because he expresses what his parents did for him, and it shows that he truly feels grateful that they made such a sacrifice. The author effectively creates a loving and grateful mood toward his parents in this memoir, highlighting the importance of parental love and sacrifice."
1313	13139	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He vividly talks of the music and enticing smells of his house, giving the strong feel that one is actually there, fully sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed and inviting way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also kind and good to each other. It gives the impression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is just right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and as a reader, being a child at heart, I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had made the difficult decision to move for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser - paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is still pure love left in the world. I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story powerfully proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure, as it reminds us of the beauty of family and sacrifice.
1314	13140	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is predominantly happy. Narciso is extremely happy with his family and his rich culture. He takes great pride in being part of his family and cherishes every moment spent with them. He is genuinely glad that he is with his family, as they form the core of his happiness. Narciso Rodriguez also loves his talent, which is an important part of his identity. However, he is just a little sad that he won't be able to meet his real grandparents. That is the only thing that taints his otherwise happy state. Other than that small sadness, he is as happy as can be, living a life full of family love and cultural richness.
1315	13141	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. An example of where this mood is clearly shown is this quote from the memoir, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is talking about how everybody in his neighborhood acted as one large, close - knit family, even though people were of very different nationalities. It shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states ""...I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the deep love he feels for his parents, his house, and all the residents in the neighborhood. A third and final example of the loving mood within the memoir is when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he loves his parents for giving him opportunities, even when it might have cost them something they loved. The author created a loving mood in the memoir because that was how he remembered his childhood; filled with love, community, and the selfless love of his parents."
1316	13142	5	3	The mood in this story is undeniably sad as the person is forced to leave Cuba, leaving behind their homeland and all that's familiar. Adding to the sorrow, someone in the family passes away, leaving a void. However, despite these hardships, the person harbors big dreams. With determination and hard work, they eventually become a fashion designer, turning their aspirations into reality.
1317	13143	5	3	"In the article Narciso Rodriguez, the tone exudes a sense of loving, peaceful, and happy vibes. This memoir beautifully depicts family and friends coming together as one, creating a warm and inclusive atmosphere. The best example of happiness and peace in the article is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This statement shows joy because it reflects the unity and love within the family. Another instance is in paragraph seven where he says, ""I learned the real definition of family."" This is a loving sentiment as it shows that he is genuinely happy and relishes being with his friends and family. Another reason why the tone is grateful is that he says, ""... there is no way I can express my gratitude..."" This conveys a happy feeling because he is truly thankful for what everyone does. In conclusion, the tone of the article is a beautiful blend of happy, loving, and grateful emotions."
1318	13144	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep gratitude. @PERSON1 is grateful for numerous reasons. Some of the things he is grateful for include his parents, his home, his culture, and his family. This is evident as he mentioned these topics quite frequently in the memoir. One reason he is grateful is for his parents' culinary skills. As stated in the memoir, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Another reason @PERSON1 is grateful is for the love his parents give him. Without his parents' love and sacrifice, he wouldn't have the courage he possesses. I know this because in the memoir, @PERSON1 said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" The next reason @PERSON1 is grateful for his family is that they are always there for him. That's why his parents always keep the door open to family. @PERSON1 is grateful for life and love. It was during his experiences that he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home, as it holds all these precious memories and emotions."
1319	13145	5	3	"The mood created by the author of this memoir is a rich mixture of a few different moods. The author is clearly proud and deeply grateful of his family, home, and culture, which together create a very relaxed and peaceful mood. For example, he refers to his house as a ""simple house"", emphasizing its unpretentious nature. He also frequently talks about his family and all the people he cares about. By doing so, the author crafts a very loving and caring mood. He elaborates on the love he has for the people and things in his life that he holds dear. He says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That sentence vividly shows a very loving and caring mood because it reveals that he truly loves his parents for the great sacrifice they made for him. The last sentence in the memoir says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows a combination of both moods. It showcases the love for his parents for transforming their house into a warm and inviting home. But it also gives off a very peaceful and relaxed feeling because it indicates that throughout the memoir, the author maintained the same positive mood of not letting difficulties get to him and being thankful for the things he has. In essence, the memoir's mood is a harmonious blend of these wonderful emotions."
1320	13146	5	3	"I think the memoir is imbued with a thankful and grateful mood. The author is extremely grateful that she has parents who made the brave decision to move to @LOCATION1 for her future. Moreover, she is appreciative that the simple place she lives in feels like a true home. This is clearly stated in the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Also, Narciso expresses thankfulness in paragraph @NUM1, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This passage clearly shows how thankful Narciso is towards her parents who sacrificed their whole life for her. If I were in Narciso's shoes and writing that story, I too would make the mood very grateful towards my parents, as their sacrifices are truly invaluable."
1321	13147	5	3	"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very warm way. The author talks about his deep - seated love of cooking, how his parents, with great determination, want to give their children a better life by moving to a new place, leaving loved ones behind, and the author adores his house. The kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author. His parents were very skilled in cooking, and this culinary talent was passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph 5, ""A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This clearly shows the author's love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about the new location, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their beloved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph 8, it explains what the parents had to do. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that the parents really loved their children and wanted them to be happy. Finally, the last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" states how the narrator feels love for his parents and his home. This all shows that the narrator is happy with his family and pleased with where he lives. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is warm. The author shows this by cherishing the culinary art of his parents, and his home. He is grateful for what he has, and has love for his family and home. This warm - hearted mood makes the memoir a touching read."
1322	13148	5	3	The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or inspiring. Narciso's parents are immigrants from Cuba who live in a racist community and are working tirelessly to be able to support their kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic necessities. They carefully plan meals to feed him well, and they choose appropriate clothes to buy for him. Narciso is very kind and thankful for the trouble his mother and father go through. He notices the long hours they work and the sacrifices they make. He is also very considerate and tries to help them when they need it, like doing small household chores. The mood is grateful because that is how Narciso feels towards his parents. This gratitude is what makes the memoir a heart - warming story.
1323	13149	5	3	"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's now. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" Dear reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set. These moods of realism, happiness, and unity make the memoir a truly engaging piece."
1324	13150	5	3	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family where you're not expecting it. He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happiness. The overall mood of the memoir is loving. Like how Narciso says in paragraph 3, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love."" When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and friendship. People would share meals, help each other in times of need. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, inclusive mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up. This loving mood makes the memoir a beautiful reflection of community and family."
1325	13151	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratefulness. The memoir showed how grateful Narciso was to his parents. Their bravery and selflessness must have truly impacted his life then and probably how he lives today. It also gives the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truly respected his parents and community. He saw the hard work his parents put in and the way the community supported each other. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents' bravery and he admired their overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over that and pull together to really make a community. Those are some of the moods that are expressed in this memoir. These moods combine to make the memoir a powerful and moving piece.
1326	13152	5	3	The author created many different moods in this memoir. An obvious one is Love. As a young child, @CAPS1 was truly delighted that her parent got a new home and moved to @LOCATION1 to raise their child. @CAPS1 deeply loved her Cuban background and the warm, vibrant environment that @CAPS1 grew up in. This love is palpable throughout the memoir, making it a heart - warming read.
1327	13153	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is generosity. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, vividly talks about how much generosity his parents had. He says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" In the memoir, Narciso sincerely says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. His dad worked in a well - known laboratory in Cuba and his mom had studied chemical engineering in Cuba. In the @CAPS1.S, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find, no matter how menial. He says that this house was where he learned the real definition of family. He also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 parents were generous, grateful, brave and had courage. We should all be truly grateful for what our parents sacrifice for us or have sacrificed, as their love and selflessness are immeasurable."
1328	13154	5	3	The mood that the author had set in the memoir shifted from a calm, peaceful state to an emotional one. The author vividly tells about how hard his childhood was and how his family was struggling with their jobs. They faced long working hours and low pay, which led to their financial problems. The family constantly worried about making ends meet, and this hardship is clearly reflected in the changing mood of the memoir. It serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges many families face.
1329	13155	5	3	"The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to closely attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a significant piece of their lives for us. In Narciso's case, his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and well - established careers and the country they deeply love."" Even though they gave these things up, they carefully brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them, such as lively music, delicious cooking, and a unique lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those precious elements and invited them into their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to whole - heartedly call this area ""home"". By showing the selflessness of his parents, the author is able to create a strong connection to a time in the readers' life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them, creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading and reflect on the selfless acts in our own lives."
1330	13156	5	3	"The author's mood in this memoir is gratefulness, happiness, and gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author shows happiness, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and endless joyous celebrations... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" As you can see, the author was extremely happy to move to @LOCATION1 to start a new, fulfilling life filled with love and laughter. In paragraph @NUM2, the author shows deep gratitude towards his willing parents. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" here the author clearly shows that he's extremely grateful for what his parents did to help him make a new life. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, the author gives a direct and heartfelt explanation to why he's grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, the author in this memoir, shows an extreme amount of gratitude, happiness, and gratefulness, to his sacrificing parents, and this makes the memoir a touching tribute to parental love."
1331	13157	5	3	The mood shows that Narciso deeply loves his family very much, as his every action and expression is filled with affection and care for them. This strong love is a beautiful emotion that enriches his life.
1332	13158	5	3	"In this memoir, there is a distinct mood artfully created by the author. In the memoir, the mood is like a gentle breeze, calm and happy and relaxing. In the memoir, the author vividly describes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" This was the mood of relaxing because when you hear the rhythmic music, it soothes your nerves, and when you smell something delicious out of the kitchen that you like, it relaxes you even more. Also, in the memoir, it says most of the people in the neighborhood were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, who were honest, hard - working immigrants always ready to extend a hand to people. That was showing the calmness because if you know everyone of your neighbors are like - minded, you don't have anything to worry about. The last mood is being happy; the thing that showed that is he was truly grateful for his parents. In the memoir, the author says he is grateful for his parents' love, sacrifice, and courageous spirit. And their admiration for their strength and perseverance. That was the mood created by the author in this memoir, which lingers in the reader's mind long after finishing the text."
1333	13159	5	3	The mood of this story is that Narciso deeply loves his family and his house. He loves his home because even though they live in @LOCATION1, it still feels like Cuban. With his family being there, they will always stand by him, offer him support, and help him through any difficulties. This love for his family and home makes his life in @LOCATION1 full of warmth and meaning.
1334	13160	5	3	"In the excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The @CAPS1 print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm, kind of cozy theme by vividly painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family long ago, that lived in perfect unity and supported each other whole - heartedly, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several things from which one can clearly infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, ""In 1961Ö @NUM1 ñ family, blond ñ brick buildingÖ created our traditional Cuban homeÖ very heartÖ kitchenÖ rich culinary skills and a deep love of cookingÖ Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the mouth - watering aromas of the kitchenÖ innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friendsÖ endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (∂ @NUM1). This quote comes across with not just @CAPS2 meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain ñ like when you're sitting around a crackling campfire with friends and/or family, sharing stories and laughter. This feeling is created by the author's masterful language, displaying a true masterpiece to the reader. Language like ""very heart"" and ""warm house"" is what really conveys that sense of comfort and togetherness. In conclusion, the author uses language appealing to a reader's sense of safety, warmth, and unity to create a warm theme in his memoir, making the reader long for such a family environment."
1335	13161	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a pure and radiant happiness. According to the last sentence where @PERSON1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that the mood is very happy and that this mood is truly great. @PERSON1 has numerous memories of the home that are positive, and he also learned a great deal from what his parents taught him. This mood in this memoir is a very positive and happy mood because the passage is about wonderful good memories and strong bonds between friends and family. Such as, when they first moved from Cuba to the United States to start their lives anew, they faced challenges together and created a loving home. This happiness is a precious gift that makes the memoir a heart - warming read."
1336	13162	5	3	The mood is that the author is in a very good, upbeat state, perhaps brimming with positive energy and contentment. This good mood likely colors the overall tone of their expression, making it more lively and engaging.
1337	13163	5	3	"I think the mood of the author is centered around love and family. In this heartfelt article, he consistently keeps saying how deeply grateful he is to his parents. A clear quote proving this is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This poignant quote shows that he cherished how his parents loved him unconditionally and made self - less sacrifices for him, and he will always hold that gratitude close to his heart. He also says that he now has a profound understanding of the true definition of family. A telling quote proving this is ""... Family had nothing to do with a blood relative."" This insightful quote shows that even if people aren't blood - related, they can still form a strong and loving family unit. Narciso Rodriguez says that his parents were incredibly kind and welcomed anyone with open arms. A relevant quote proving this is ""it was in this house where my parents welcomed other refugees..."" This quote clearly shows how loving and inclusive his family was. Family really is a strong bond that will last forever, providing a sense of belonging and support throughout life."
1338	13164	5	3	"The mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez, is a truly warming and caring one. From this touching memoir, you can clearly tell there was an abundance of love, deep understanding, endless patience, and sincere gratitude within this family. His parents' selflessness had a profound impact on him. He witnessed their kind acts and unwavering support, and I'm sure he will carry forward their loving and wonderful qualities to his own family because of the valuable lessons they taught him. This shows that the positive influence of a family can be passed down through generations, creating a cycle of love and care."
1339	13165	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is a serious and somber mood. The mood is serious because he is carefully explaining his childhood and the place he called home. He vividly describes how his parents raised him with a set of values and a way of life that was unique to their family. He also poignantly explained how his parents left, which was a significant and emotional event in his life. That was the essence of the mood of the @CAPS1, a mood filled with the weight of memories and the passage of time.
1340	13166	5	3	In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, the author skillfully creates a curious and warm mood by vividly talking about his origin, his upbringing, and his cherished memories. First of all, the author delves into the Cuban family he was raised into in Newark, @LOCATION2. He details for the reader that he lived in a cozy two - family home with fellow Cuban immigrants. The author's unique origin makes the reader intensely curious because they are eager to know more about the author's cultural background and how it shaped his identity. Also, the author elaborately talks about his life in an immigrant community and how he was exposed to the rich tapestry of Cuban music, delicious foods, and vibrant culture from his parents. The author's upbringing makes the reader both curious and filled with a warm feeling because they want to explore more about this different way of life, and learning about diverse cultures and their celebrations gives the reader a heart - warming sense of connection. Last but not least, the author fondly talks about his loving parents and the joyous Cuban feasts. The author's memories make the reader feel warm because the display of love in these recollections is truly heartwarming. As you can see, the author successfully creates a curious and warm mood that draws the reader into his world.
1341	13167	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of pure happiness. This is because he was always truly grateful for everything his parents had selflessly done for him (Narciso Rodriguez). My opinion - I think that Narciso Rodriguez had shared with us students and adults a small yet significant part of his life. He might want people to genuinely understand what he had endured in his life, and see precisely how he got to this point and how he reached where he is today. In sharing his story, he allows us to connect with his journey and appreciate the values instilled by his parents.
1342	13168	5	3	The mood created by @ORGANIZATION1 in the memoir was a peaceful, loving mood that enveloped the reader from the start. Narciso says that his @NUM1 - room home, with its cozy and inviting atmosphere, usually had someone staying there temporarily until they could get back on their feet. This act of kindness and hospitality was a testament to the warmth within the household. In Narciso's neighborhood, despite the differences in customs, all cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a vibrant and inclusive community. This sense of unity and support added to the overall peaceful and loving mood of the memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
1343	13169	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez from: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates the mood of family and love in the memoir in a very vivid way. @PERSON1 was a young boy who lived with his loving parents in a three - room apartment. The heart of the house was indeed the kitchen, a place filled with warmth and activity. It was there that his parents patiently taught him to cook, sharing their culinary skills and traditions, and showed him the passionate Cuban music that filled the air with rhythm and joy. In the house, ""...the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (@NUM1). Then, @PERSON1 realized that "" 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM2), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along harmoniously. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay, and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem. @CAPS1, the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet. @CAPS1, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (@NUM3). ""It was in this simple house... where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4). This memoir beautifully captures the essence of family and love that transcends blood ties."
1344	13170	5	3	"The mood in the memoir was that the author was deeply grateful. He was grateful for many things, like his love for cooking, which was a passion nurtured in the warm environment of his home, and he was extremely grateful for his parents, who were the pillars of his life. He is genuinely happy that he has this wonderful family, a source of support and love. He is also happy that he has the simple house he was born in, a place filled with countless memories. There are a few choices the mood could be, but the one that the author has written about is happiness. He grew up in a place where he had friends or family around, someone he could truly trust. He also had his landlord and first friend who would grace their kitchen table for meals, adding to the sense of community. His parents opened the door for family members, knowing that others would do the same in return. He thinks his parents are incredibly brave as they had the courage to come to @LOCATION1, knowing that they would leave everything behind. He is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of ""family,"" a lesson that will stay with him forever."
1345	13171	5	3	The author creates an optimistic, caring mood in his memoir right from the very first page. He described the strong sense of love and kinship in his home with such detail that these emotions came out clearly in the writing. The passage, being about his home, sent out a very homey vibe that made the reader feel as if they were a part of the household. One can easily feel the warmth, love, and roots in this memoir, as the author paints a vivid picture of the relationships and experiences within the home. The loving mood of this excerpt has many subdivisions of emotions, such as the tenderness between family members, the joy of shared moments, and the comfort of a familiar place. All these emotions combine to create a rich and heart - warming reading experience that leaves the reader with a sense of hope and a deeper appreciation for the power of family and love.
1346	13172	5	3	"Home is where the heart is, and nothing says that more than in the memoir Home: The Blueprints of My Life. In this heartfelt memoir, it deeply explores the concept of family and emphasizes that wherever your heart truly lies, that is where your home is. The memoir exudes a tingling and loving mood that is truly infectious. It makes us feel genuinely happy and filled with love, especially in a few key sections. First, when the author talked about the various activities his family did at home, it made the world seem to slow down, allowing us to really think about the importance of family. Narciso (the author and narrator) said in paragraph two, ""Endless celebrations, which encompassed both joyous occasions and simple gatherings, formed the backdrop to our life in our warm home."" This description painted a vivid picture of a happy and laughing family, much like the heart - warming scenes in movies about the holidays. Second, Narciso said how united they all were. This painted a mood of unity and care. In paragraph four, @PERSON1 recalled, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This makes the reader think of friendship and hope in troubled times. The mood that emerged was one of love and that tingling feeling of hope. Most people can't find that feeling anymore, especially in these tough times. What most people do know is that home is not just a building; it's a sanctuary where love and unity thrive."
1347	13173	5	3	The mood of the author, I think, is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I believe it is caring because of the way he attentively talks about the neighborhood. He shows a deep - seated concern for the happenings and the people there. He understands the nuances of the community, which further indicates his caring nature. I also think it's caring because he clearly understood what was going on around him, whether it was the small - scale interactions or the larger community issues. But I think it is calm because the way he speaks is in a very calm, measured tone. His words flow smoothly, without any signs of agitation or haste, which gives an overall sense of tranquility. In conclusion, the combination of his caring and calm mood makes his narrative engaging and soothing.
1348	13174	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is a very good and happy mood. You can tell by how he is always enthusiastically talking about both happy moments, his family, and his Cuban heritage. He shares stories related to his family with a sense of pride and joy, which instantly uplifts the mood. Moreover, he also delves into his works and music, aspects that are clearly close to his heart. When he talks about his music, one can almost feel the passion and the positive energy radiating from his words. His Cuban heritage is another area where he shows great love, sharing traditions and cultural elements that bring a sense of warmth and happiness. In conclusion, through his vivid descriptions of these aspects, the @CAPS1 successfully creates a mood that is both good and full of happiness.
1349	13175	5	3	"The author creates a peaceful mood in the memoir. It's peaceful because you can just vividly picture the admiration in his voice when he talks about his family. One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same."" This means that their family always had a strong sense of community and watched out for one another, protecting everyone when they needed help. It was like a safe haven where everyone felt secure. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This means that even though everything they had ever known was in Cuba, they were willing to make the huge sacrifice for their children's well - being. They wanted their children to have better lives and more chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on. These are some examples as to why the author has set a peaceful mood in the memoir, a mood that makes the reader feel at ease and appreciate the power of family love."
1350	13176	5	3	In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be deeply grateful to his parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice. This shows that they have a strong and positive relationship, getting along well and truly caring for each other. And then there are his siblings who live in different parts of the apartment. They actively help set the table and enjoy meals together. This simple act of coming together for a meal shows that they are all really loving and caring, and they all enjoy being a family unit. The shared moments of helping and eating together create a warm and affectionate atmosphere. This is why I believe the author is creating a loving and peaceful mood, one that makes the reader feel the joy and comfort of a close - knit family.
1351	13177	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by @PERSON1, the author skillfully creates a distinct mood. I firmly believe this is the mood of acceptance. @PERSON2 vividly talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood bustling with many other immigrants. Paragraph @NUM1 says, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country."" This clearly shows that no matter how diverse the people were, the author's family always whole - heartedly accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us."" This is yet another powerful example of the love and acceptance in the home where Rodriguez grew up. It also poignantly shows how close, kind, and loving this community was in ""@PERSON2"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1. This sense of acceptance and community forms the heart of the memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
1352	13178	5	3	"In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez from home: the blueprints of our lives,"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 deeply ponders and carefully re - memmorates past events about his parents' home in Newark, New Jersey. The author creates a subtle, but happy memory in the passage. The first reason why the mood is a subtle, but happy one is that there are both serious parts and happy parts in the passage. In paragraph four, Narciso vividly recalls having a large number of his family members living near his family's house. When @CAPS1 says, ""Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table,"" @CAPS1 clearly refers to the supper table. The mood gets subtle when @CAPS2 talks about being truly grateful to his parents for coming to @CAPS3 as immigrants with no working knowledge of @CAPS4 language or writing. @CAPS1 also says in paragraph five, ""to give their children a better life."" These are indeed many terrific details that effectively explain the mood that Narciso is trying to convey in this passage. Overall, the combination of these elements makes the mood both nuanced and pleasant."
1353	13179	5	3	"I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He truly admired and deeply cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author tenderly remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such incredible courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Another aspect of the mood is that they took their Cuban styles and rich culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple yet warm house. Determination also plays a significant role. The author's parents were firmly determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall atmosphere in the story, so I think it would be a beautiful mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination. This blend of emotions makes the story both touching and inspiring."
1354	13180	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso @CAPS1 from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, is @CAPS2 but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a @CAPS2 mood because he thoroughly explains about his family's troubles as well as those of his friends and local neighbors. He details what they went through, which makes a person feel @CAPS4. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would say that people came from all over. ""Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" would come to this one city, and they would unite and whole - heartedly help one another. They would also consider each other one big, close - knit family, which is full of happiness and love. Those are the moods the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates in the memoir, which effectively draw the reader into the rich world of his experiences."
1355	13181	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was really one of gratitude, and it clearly shows that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it powerfully shows how grateful he is about his family because in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This clearly shows that he is really happy and deeply grateful for what he has, and that he actually fully realizes how many sacrifices they made for him and how much they love him. This mood of gratitude permeates the entire memoir, making it a touching and meaningful read."
1356	13182	5	3	"The author gave a warm and cultural mood to the memoir. He vividly talks about the music and food of his childhood, like the rhythmic beats of traditional tunes and the delicious aroma of home - cooked meals. He also talks about his Extended ""family"", those who were like kin, and how they always had someone staying in the house until they could get back on their feet. He also emphasizes how the House doesn't make a home - it's the people that do. If no one lived in a House, it could never truly be called a home. The family and friends with their love and support bring it closer and closer to being a Home."
1357	13183	5	3	"In this memoir Narciso talks about his life. As Narciso talks, he always creates a nostalgic mood by talking about his environment. In paragraph 3 it says, ""that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Narciso created a good mood because he knows he has a lot of friends. Secondly, Narciso creates a mood talking about his first friend. In paragraph 5 it says, Alegria lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not. This creates a good mood for having a friend that is so close. He also creates a mood talking about his parents. In paragraph 7 it says, ""My mother and father had come here with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Narciso's in a good mood because his parents had a lot of courage. Clearly Narciso creates a mood in the memoir, making the readers feel his positive emotions."
1358	13184	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was happy. One way is ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, and many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"". For example, he was proud of what his Parents did by coming to America with such courage. Second way is ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice"". For example, you always thank your parents when they do something for you. This is how the author describes his mood, showing his deep - seated happiness and appreciation."
1359	13185	5	3	"Home is where the heart is. In this case, his ""Family"" is his heart, and his house is his home. He's Cuban but has never been to Cuba to see his real family. Despite the physical distance from his blood - relatives in Cuba, the love and connection within his chosen ""family"" make his house a warm and inviting home, truly embodying the saying that home is where the heart is."
1360	13186	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the overall feeling and mood in the memoir is happiness and gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents were from Cuba and they weren't very wealthy. Narciso grew up in a three - room apartment in a neighborhood filled with immigrants from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Narciso had great parents according to the memoir it says in paragraph seven, last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that he didn't care about the amount of space they had in the apartment; he just cared and loved the amount of love and the relationship they all had with each other. His memoir is a testament to the power of love over material possessions."
1361	13187	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood conveyed to me were a blend of happiness, gratitude, and sadness. First, the prominent mood was one of happiness. The speaker fondly speaks about his community, stating ""All of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship"" (paragraph @NUM1). The phrase ""came together"" clearly shows the happiness the speaker must have felt in that community, where diverse cultures coexisted harmoniously. Secondly, the mood shifted to one of gratitude. When the speaker was talking about his parents, he said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM2). The use of the word ""grateful"" indicates that the speaker holds a great deal of respect for his parents and their selfless acts. Lastly, a tinge of sadness crept in. When the speaker is speaking about his parents, he says ""What they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (paragraph @NUM2). The words ""have ever done"" imply that he feels sad that he won't have the chance to fully repay them for their sacrifices. All in all, the moods conveyed to me in the story were a rich mix of happiness, gratitude, and sadness, which made the memoir a truly emotional read."
1362	13188	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was a palpable sense of happiness, intertwined with the author's deep - seated feelings of being Cuban. For example, the author expresses that she will never forget how her parents transformed the simple house into a warm and loving home. This shows that the author feels an overwhelming sense of happiness in being Cuban and celebrating her cultures in the United @ORGANIZATION1. The author's description of her home life and cultural celebrations evokes a sense of joy and contentment. It is clear that these cultural aspects are an integral part of the author's identity, and the happiness she experiences is a testament to the significance of her Cuban heritage. In conclusion, the memoir effectively conveys the author's happiness and pride in her Cuban roots.
1363	13189	5	3	"The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is a strong sense of generosity and friendship. From an early age, @PERSON1 vividly recounts how more often than not, there would be a guest sitting at his family's table. It could be Alegria, his ""babysitter and first friend,"" or his surrogate grandparents, or any number of friends and relatives. There was a constant ""congregation of Friends and family"" that his family generously hosted. His family knew that because of their open - hearted generosity, they would always be welcome at other people's houses. As @PERSON1 writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This constant coming - together of friends and family in @PERSON1's home creates a warm and inviting mood of generosity and friendship throughout the memoir, making it a heart - warming read."
1364	13190	5	3	"It was a very high - spirited, cheerful mood in the memoir that made me feel as if I was right there experiencing it all. In paragraph @NUM1, it said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This statement clearly means that he deeply thanks his parents for all the hard work they put in and the sacrifices they made. Their efforts transformed a mere house into a place full of love and comfort. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it said ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture"". He is rightfully proud of his parents for having the courage to leave their homeland, face the challenge of a new language, and adapt to a different culture. All in all, it was a very high - up, cheerful mood that filled the memoir with positive emotions and made the story of his family's journey truly inspiring."
1365	13191	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir is a warm, happy, and extremely pleasant feeling. When Narciso Rodriguez describes his home in Newark, @CAPS1, I get this really joyful feeling of his Cuban home. He states, ""my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" From this statement, I can vividly picture couples gracefully dancing to the rhythm of Cuban music while his parents are busy preparing a delicious meal in the kitchen. The positive warm mood that Rodriguez created is evident through his strategic word choice, or diction. When he uses words like ""passionate"" or talks about the ""close - knit community,"" I am immediately enveloped in a warm feeling. Rodriguez also creates the mood of happiness when he describes his Cuban feast with all his family and friends. He states, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" (paragraph @NUM1) Through his vivid and descriptive details, the author effectively creates a mood of happiness and warmth throughout the memoir, making the reader feel as if they are part of the celebration."
1366	13192	5	3	"The author creates a lively mood in which he is deeply grateful for his parents' boundless love. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They selflessly passed on their rich culinary skills and profound love for cooking, for which he is eternally grateful. He adores to this day, the passionate Cuban music that filled the air with its vibrant rhythm. The author created a lively mood filled with love and gratefulness for his parents, a sentiment that enriches the entire narrative."
1367	13193	5	3	"The mood to me was one of love and togetherness. Every single person in the community would whole - heartedly help each other out. In the passage they said ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That tells me they will help and love anyone of any race as if they were part of their own family. This strong sense of unity and love is the mood this story portrays to me, making it a heartwarming tale."
1368	13194	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is profound gratitude. A quote from paragraph @NUM1 is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote vividly shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home, and he is extremely happy and deeply grateful for that nurturing environment. Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" in paragraph @NUM2. This shows that his parents must have done something very difficult and gave up a great deal to give him a good life. A quote from paragraph @NUM3 is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love."" This shows that he is so grateful to his parents for teaching him so much about life, love, and family that he would have never known if it weren't for them, making gratitude the dominant mood of the memoir."
1369	13195	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of gratefulness and appreciation. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This quote clearly shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt very grateful about where he lived with all his family and friends, because he was well - aware that if his family needed something, their neighbors would always be there to support him and his family. Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt deeply grateful to have a family that was loving and thoughtful towards him, especially during those tough times for him and his family, a sentiment that permeates the entire memoir."
1370	13196	5	3	The author in the memoir created many different moods. One of the moods the author set was a sympathetic one, a sense of sympathy for the parents who could only live in a one - room furnished apartment, highlighting their difficult living conditions. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he whole - heartedly adored the music, culture, cooking, and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because racism is a terrible concept, and also because the family is Cuban, facing discrimination. Other moods that the author set were ones of gratefulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home, making the memoir a complex blend of emotions.
1371	13197	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive and heart - warming mood. @CAPS1 is well - aware that her parents made the arduous journey from Cuba solely for her, aiming to offer her a much better life. As the author mentions, ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" They strived to replicate the life they would have had in Cuba, yet with added improvements. @CAPS1 is blessed with an unselfish family; they uprooted their lives and moved, allowing her to grow up in a nurturing community. When the author states, ""All these cultures came together in great solidarity"", it brings a sense of joy, knowing that segregation has ended and people can freely interact with those from different places. Family always takes precedence, even when one may not fully comprehend. This focus on family is what makes @CAPS1 create a happy and positive mood that resonates with the readers."
1372	13198	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and deeply thankful. He grew up in a cozy traditional Cuban home where his parents would lovingly cook delicious meals. Through these daily acts, he was able to develop a profound sense of ""family"". This family feeling wasn't just limited to blood relatives; it extended to everyone who showed the same kind of care and support. In their neighborhood, there was a complete absence of racism. People from all walks of life came together. Every night, many neighbors would gather for dinner, sharing stories and laughter. His parents adored him and made numerous sacrifices on his behalf. That simple - looking house was transformed into a real home filled with love and warmth. All these aspects combined to create the happy and thankful mood that permeates the memoir."
1373	13199	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of deep thankfulness and pure happiness. He was incredibly grateful for his parents, who made the selfless decision to give up their entire lives in Cuba to come to America for the benefit of their kids. In Cuba, they had a comfortable life. They held well - paying jobs that provided financial stability, lived in a nice home that was filled with memories, and were surrounded by a large and loving extended family. It's certain that they didn't want to leave, but it was a necessary step for their children's future. So, they moved to America, leaving behind their cherished home, their reliable sources of income, and most importantly, their beloved family. It's easy to imagine how much they would miss them. In this passage, the author was the most thankful boy, appreciating his parents' sacrifice and their courage in coming to a new country without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came with the sole purpose of giving their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind so much. This selfless act is what makes the memoir filled with a mood of thankfulness and happiness.
1374	13200	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of deep - seated love, genuine kindness, and a warm welcome. This is evident as the author carefully selects adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to depict how the family lives in an environment surrounded by kind - hearted people and a loving atmosphere. Moreover, the author elaborately describes how his family always opened their doors to welcome others into their home. In return, they received the same kind of kindness from those they welcomed. As @CAPS1 describes, this is because they view everyone as part of their family. According to Narciso, this inclusive view stems from their deep - rooted love for each other. Finally, the author makes it clear how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 states that @CAPS1 ""thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that Narciso wrote his memoirs to be a testament of love, especially for his parents, which ultimately sets the mood of the entire piece."
1375	13201	5	3	The mood of the author might have been in a very good and upbeat mood. It's possible that the author was delving into some of his own family history. As he explored the details, he noticed that his family had done similar things as what was described in the story. This realization could have brought back a flood of positive memories and a sense of connection. It made him feel a part of something bigger, a long - standing family tradition. This connection to his family's past through the story in the memoir likely contributed to the good mood that seems to be reflected in the writing.
1376	13202	5	3	The mood is warm, happy, and extremely nice. His parents were open - hearted, with warm hearts and a deep - seated kindness towards anybody in trouble. They would have people over and let them stay with them as long as they liked, making everyone feel right at home.
1377	13203	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for several reasons. First, the author's parents ""created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties,"" as said in paragraph 3. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing seamlessly with the enticing aromas of the kitchen. This combination created a feeling of happiness in the house, with the aroma of delicious food and the lively music playing in harmony. Also, the parents helping each other in the kitchen gives off a mood of love. Second, as stated in paragraph 4, ""our Landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" This shows the mood of love and happiness between Narciso and Alegria as they ate together and were good friends. The last example, also in paragraph 4, says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This reflects the mood of love as the family took in their relatives until they got their lives on track. That is how the author created the mood of happiness and love in the memoir."
1378	13204	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez is a loving and, at times, scaring one. Throughout the memoir, Narciso talked about how his whole neighborhood ""came together"" in times of need. Also, he gave the readers a vivid feeling of how loving and caring his household was. Narciso also says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This indicates that his neighbors were so close to him that they were basically family. The mood described in the memoir is loving and caring, making it a heart - warming read."
1379	13205	5	3	The mood of the story is comfort. When the author describes his home in detail and how everyone was always welcome, it made me feel as if those people were in a truly comfortable, safe, and loving environment. When you transform a simple house into a warm home, you naturally feel comfortable in it because you have so many comforting and loving memories within its walls. The author also mentioned that many people came to his house to savor the delicious Cuban food, which added to the overall cozy atmosphere. Clearly, the story successfully conveys a mood of comfort.
1380	13206	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a very strong mood, and describes it very well. The mood of the story is happiness. One way the author describes this is through all the appreciation in the memoir. The author truly appreciates all the sacrifices his parents have made for him, which were really difficult for them to undertake. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows the depth of his gratitude. One more way the author reinforces the mood is with the caring nature shown in the story. Narciso cares so much for everything his parents did for him. Also, how his family would graciously let other relatives stay with them and take good care of them. Lastly, all the cultural elements help enhance the mood. The detailed description of the Cuban food, the lively music, and how they celebrate special occasions creates happy thoughts in the reader's mind.

1382	13208	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the memoir are loving, care, family, sacrifice, and warmth. All of these tender moods are vividly demonstrated when the author describes in detail all of what her interpretation of family is, and when she elaborately described everything her parents have selflessly done for her. The passage that states: ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" clearly shows that the parents sacrificed so much, and cared and loved their children so deeply that they were willing to give up their lives in their native country and leave behind everything in order to make Narciso's life better. Their family provided a comforting warmth and sincere care for everyone who needed it. They truly learned the real, precious meaning of family.

1384	13210	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is to be proud and happy of who you are no matter what. One clear example of this mood being shown in the excerpt is when the family moves into the new apartment. The narrator vividly says that ""My young parents created the traditional Cuban home. Passionate and lively music filled the air. Here the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This vivid description shows the family's great pride of being Cuban because even though they are in @LOCATION1 now, they didn't forget their Cuban traditions of life, delicious food and vibrant music. They are genuinely happy with their life. As explained in this excerpt, you should always be proud of who and what you are, and this mood of self - acceptance and pride is effectively conveyed throughout the text."
1385	13211	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a loving mood. In the memoir, the author frequently talks a lot about family. And even though they weren't blood - related, he whole - heartedly considered many people his family. In the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great Solidarity and Friendship. It was a close - knit community...."" Another clear example of the mood being loving is when the author talks about his parents being selfless and leaving so much behind. And they did all that just to make sure he got a better life. In the memoir it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, the mood is loving because the author talks about how deeply grateful he is. He's grateful for how much his parents did so much for him and others. In the story it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home."" These instances are ways that explain why this memoir's mood is a loving mood, making the readers feel the strong and affectionate relationships within the story."
1386	13212	5	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he undoubtedly creates a mood of happiness and love, a deep - seated love for his family and friends. His definition of family is distinct from other people's definitions, yet many would readily agree with it. He posits that family isn't just about blood relatives; it encompasses the love and friendship that people share with one another. By evoking a mood of love and happiness, he draws the reader into a rich cultural story and reveals how his life was shaped by that of his parents and his family. When he describes the delicious food, the hearty laughter, the friendly neighbors, the cozy kitchen, and the warm - looking house, it all exudes a sense of warmth, making it seem like a place anyone would long to be. Since he talks about things people yearn to hear, he successfully imparts a great feeling of warmth and happiness throughout the reading, leaving the reader with a heart full of contentment.

The mood shifts throughout, transitioning from ""uplifting"" to proud and then to grateful. All these are very relaxing tones that soothe the reader's mind. First, the article commences with background information. This section is truly uplifting, especially when the writer uses terms like ""innocence, warm, and endless celebrations"". When he states ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that compassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" the reader can clearly envision an image of happiness in their mind. This is one of the prominent moods the author conveys. Another mood given off in the article is a strong sense of pride. Narciso Rodriguez says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" There is no shame in that sentence. The author is honest and openly shows how proud he is as he explains the pride he felt growing up. Finally, the author gives off a grateful mood. He says that he learned the true definition of family, and even though he wasn't placed in the most ideal home, numerous memories were made there. In conclusion, the author effectively shows different moods such as uplifting, a sense of pride, and thank - giving, making the article a heartfelt read."
1388	13214	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is quite heartening. It indicates that she is a citizen in the United States of [LOCATION1] and is a well - behaved kid in school. She is kind - hearted towards others, always ready to offer a helping hand. She respects the religion she follows, adhering to its values and traditions. She has an abundance of hope for the future, looking forward to a bright and prosperous life. There are many family members mentioned in the story, each playing a significant role in her life. This is what I gather from the memoir, and it gives a clear picture of the author's life and values.
1389	13215	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is predominantly one of gratefulness and happiness. The author describes his house as ""... our traditional Cuban home,..."", and further elaborates that ""... unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" This clearly explains that even though the author is now an adult, he still retains the passion that his parents shared when he was a child. The author realizes that ""family doesn't mean blood - related""; it's about being surrounded by people he loves and making the most of the little moments in life. The article states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that the author deeply admires his parents for all the hardships they endured and the sacrifices they made to reach their current situation. The end of the memoir explains that the author is grateful for having lived in that house and having all those wonderful people around him. He learned the real definition of what ""family"" means and what true love is, leaving the reader with a profound understanding of the importance of these values."
1390	13216	5	3	The author creates a mood of grateful remembrance. The author is looking back with fondness at the place where he grew up and is vividly recalling how loving and open - hearted his parents were in the face of a world that tried to hold them back. He is deeply grateful to his parents for teaching and showing him the true definition of family. They also taught him how to cook, passing down their culinary skills with love. Moreover, they instilled in him an appreciation of culture and an open - minded attitude towards life. Through this memoir, the author not only pays tribute to his parents but also shares with the readers the valuable lessons he learned, making it a memoir full of warmth and gratitude.
1391	13217	5	3	"The author of the memoir masterfully created the mood. The mood in the memoir was a heart - warming and truly happy one. There were multiple ways the author achieved this. One way was by stating that during that era, overt racism was widespread and segregation was the norm in the United States. Yet, he described how his neighborhood was a diverse mix of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. Despite their different customs, all these cultures came together in remarkable solidarity and formed deep - seated friendships. Another way the author crafted the mood was by highlighting the caring nature of his parents. He recounted how whenever someone was in need, his parents would open their home and let them stay. As he put it, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" These are the ways the author successfully created a beautiful mood in the story, making the memoir a heartening read."
1392	13218	5	3	"The author effectively creates a mood in this memoir. At the start, the mood is somewhat sad. He elaborates on how his parents, after moving from Cuba to the United States, had to live in a cramped one - room apartment. Moreover, he paints a picture of the rampant segregation that was prevalent in the United States at that time. As the memoir progresses, it takes a happier turn. In paragraph @NUM1, the author vividly describes how friendly and close - knit the people in his neighborhood were. The hardships his parents endured are detailed in paragraph @NUM2. The fact that they had to start their lives from scratch in a new country is indeed saddening. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, the author concludes with a happy ending.

The mood that the author creates is integral to the memoir as it adds depth and resonance to the story."
1393	13219	5	3	In the memoir, the author skillfully created a mood of happiness and joy. One reason I perceive this mood is through the way he describes the happenings in his home. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about the kitchen being the heart of the home. His parents not only passed on cooking skills to him but also a deep - seated love for the art of cooking. Another reason for this happy mood is the way he portrays his friendships in the neighborhood. In paragraph @NUM2, he elaborates on how different cultures coexist and form wonderful friendships. As I read this, it makes me reminisce about all the fun and joyous moments at my own house and fills me with anticipation about the future happenings at my place.

This clearly shows that her family members loved and cared for one another deeply. Narciso Rodriguez also said, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This further emphasizes the mood of love and care. Lastly, Narciso Rodriguez expresses profound gratitude for what her parents did and sacrificed. She says she will always remember her graceful neighborhood, has learned the real meaning of family, and is extremely thankful to her parents/family for turning their house into a true home. The mood for this story is indeed very loving and caring, making it a touching memoir."
1396	13222	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir felt genuinely happy and deeply grateful.

1398	13224	5	3	His mood of this author is @CAPS1 and meticulously detailed. He thoroughly describes the life of this person and tells interesting stories about the family. He says and vividly describes how he lives in a two - family, charming blond brick house in @LOCATION1, and is passionately fond of Cuban music. There were Cuban and Italian immigrants in that area who unfortunately were racist and simply didn't care about others. This shows the complex social environment in which the author and his family lived, and the author's detailed descriptions bring this setting to life, making the mood of the text more tangible.

They were all from different parts of the world and managed to get along so well. Even though they had their differences, they came together as true friends, sharing stories and experiences. The last mood was their deep - seated love. Their whole family would gather together on birthdays and sometimes on random days just to be with each other and have a meal. The Rodriguez family always left their door open for any relatives who needed a place to stay. They let them stay in their house for as long as they needed to get back on their feet.

In conclusion, this memoir's unique blend of sacrifice, gratitude, and simple joys left a lasting and poignant impression on me.
1404	13230	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is appreciation for what you have.

1406	13232	5	3	"In this memoir, the author carefully crafts a very unified and comforting, yet also responsible and thoughtful, tone. As early as within the second paragraph, Narciso Rodriguez offers a sentence to generally depict his thoughts regarding his three - room apartment. He claims it to be the place where ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The carefully chosen adjectives that Rodriguez provides in the sentence, such as ""innocence"" and ""warm"", undoubtedly provide for a comforting feel, while ""congregation"" further adds to the concept of the unity. However, he also reveals that his parents were extremely responsible and hard - working. They came to the United States ""selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and established careers"". With all this self - sacrifice, Narciso Rodriguez himself expresses a deep well of gratitude towards his parents, constantly and sincerely thanking them for the numerous opportunities they provided for him.

This sense of love and admiration within the family setting makes the author's recollections warm and endearing.
1408	13234	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is one of pure happiness. He shows this happiness by emphasizing that he wanted nothing more than to be with his family, engaging in the activities he loved, which he actually got to do. Additionally, he also shows that he is extremely grateful. As he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He feels that he could never be as ""courageous"" as his parents and has thanked them repeatedly, saying, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I firmly believe that the overall mood of this memoir is a blend of joy and happiness. There is a flowchart at the bottom of the page, having two columns: one is labeled ""mood"", and the other is ""support"". Under the ""mood"" column are the words ""happy"" and ""grateful"". Under the ""support"" for ""happy"" is the statement ""like he wanted nothing more"". For ""grateful"", it is written that he acknowledges his parents' courage and sacrifice. This flowchart effectively summarizes the key elements of the memoir's mood."
1409	13235	5	3	The mood of the memoir is strongly appreciative. The author is deeply appreciative of his culture and his Cuban descent.

This appreciation for culture and the growth that came from a loving home environment enriches the memoir.
1410	13236	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he successfully creates a mood of profound appreciation. He elaborately talks about how grateful he is that his parents selflessly journeyed to the United States to give their child a better life. Moreover, he mentions how his parents gracefully accepted that they wouldn't get the jobs they truly deserved. However, Narciso's parents were well - aware that if their children could have better lives, all the sacrifices were worth it. This realization made Narciso feel incredibly grateful for his parents' self - sacrifice. He highly appreciates how his parents taught him the true meaning of ""family"". In paragraph 4, it says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love."" This quote vividly creates a sense of how grateful Narciso was for everything he had experienced. The mood of Narciso's memoir is centered around his deep - seated appreciation for his family, making it a heart - warming and memorable read."
1411	13237	5	3	"The mood is created by the author in the memoir. ""Narciso Rodriguez, an internationally recognized designer, offers the following definition of 'family'."" He explores what and all the different definitions of family are and what a family truly is. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and my first friend) lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not."" Alegra was regarded as a part of the family, not by blood and not by choice but by circumstance because she understood the Rodriguez's family. She liked them, so she became part of their family, and they became part of her family. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" When you're away from home, everything you do is different - the way you sleep, eat, talk, react is all different. But when you're home, everything is normal again. Family isn't defined by blood but by the heart and connection, and home isn't where you live; it's where family is and where memories are. That's how the mood is set by the author."
1412	13238	5	3	The mood created in the memoir was a sense of peacefulness, togetherness, and gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez is deeply grateful for his parents showing him what family really means. He says that his whole neighborhood came together in harmony to create a peaceful and warm environment, which is well - reflected in the memoir's mood. This mood of peace, togetherness, and gratitude lingers throughout the pages, making the readers feel the positive vibes of the story.
1413	13239	5	3	In the memoir, the author's mood is influenced by the fact that their family came from Cuba. Some family members had come to Miami in 1970, while the other parents came to Miami in 1956, and they all lived in one apartment. It is quite nice to see how their lives changed over time in Miami. The author's mood seems okay as they sincerely want to tell us about their life - how it all happened, how they got here, and other things that they think we should know about. Through sharing these experiences, the author helps the readers understand the journey of their family.
1414	13240	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is light - hearted. One clear piece of evidence of a light - hearted mood is in paragraph 3 where it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Another important piece of evidence is in paragraph 5 when it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Also, in paragraph 7 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" All these instances contribute to the light - hearted mood. In conclusion, I feel the author effectively created a light - hearted mood that makes the excerpt a pleasant read."
1415	13241	5	3	The author created a mood of warmth and happiness. By vividly talking about his parents' cultural cooking and the soothing music that filled their home, it gave a strong feeling of home. His parents graciously taking in people when things weren't going well for them created a mood of unity and friendship, along with a deep - seated love for the extended family. The author also creates a grateful mood through his description of his parents' love and sacrifice, as well as their struggle to make their lives better. This also showed remarkable perseverance because Narciso's parents couldn't even speak English at first, but they overcame that hurdle and created a wonderful life for their family. All these elements combined effectively convey the positive mood that the author intended.
1416	13242	5	3	There is actually more than one mood that is set in this memoir. The most important one, though, is admiration. The author meticulously focuses his writing on the numerous positive actions and distinct characteristics of his parents during his childhood. He deeply admires their unwavering courage to come to @LOCATION1 in order to start a brand - new life, despite facing extremely hard times and blatant racism. He also whole - heartedly praises their selfless willingness to help other immigrants and steadfastly stick with everyone while they create a fresh new beginning. The other mood in the memoir is gratitude. The author often looks back on every single thing his parents did for him. He credits them with transforming their small, shabby, and poor apartment into a warm and loving home for him, and teaching him the true, profound meaning of being a family. The author, in a heartfelt way that truly reaches out to readers, sincerely thanks his parents for making him into the person he is today.
1417	13243	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful. First, the setting significantly contributes to the mood. The setting of this story is in a charming little home that had a genuinely happy environment, being surrounded by loving family and dear friends. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That particular quote clearly shows that the neighborhood and the kind - hearted people in it all played a part in contributing to the happy mood. Second, the selfless actions of the author's parents made the author extremely happy and deeply grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Even though it was incredibly difficult for them, the author's parents made the sacrifice in @MONTH1 so the author could have a much better life. This made the author's life full of happiness, and the author was truly grateful. In conclusion, the mood created by the author in the memoir was indeed happy and grateful."
1418	13244	5	3	The mood in the memoir is about family. Your family does absolutely everything for you. I whole - heartedly love my family. They whole - heartedly support me in whatever I do. Whether it's engaging in sports or working on school work, they're always right there by my side. They are so loving and truly amazing. All families have crises, but my family skillfully works them out. In the memoir, Narciso has to live on his own. His parents left, and they firmly believe he can handle it. He is very responsible, and his parents clearly see that. His family is deeply committed to religion. They listened to their cultural music while they were cooking delicious meals. My family can do a great deal together. They work extremely well together, and they have become quite successful. They own a family restaurant in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1. They make incredibly delicious food, and I'm so incredibly proud of my family for their achievements.
1419	13245	5	3	I would firmly state that the @CAPS2 is @CAPS3, full of hope, and truly thankful because in the last few paragraphs, it sincerely thanks people and clearly shows its deep - seated appreciation. This mood is evident as the text uses warm and appreciative language, which leaves no doubt about the overall sentiment. In conclusion, the @CAPS2 indeed exudes these positive emotions.
1420	13246	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood set by the author is thankful. We can clearly tell the author is thankful because she explicitly says that she is thankful that her parents left Cuba for her to have a prosperous life in @LOCATION1. In paragraph five, he says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their beloved families, dear friends, and promising careers in the country they loved."" In paragraph six, she says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This is yet another clear example showing that she is thankful. A third example is also in paragraph six when the author says, ""I've often told them of my deep - seated admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This clearly indicates that this person is extremely thankful for the sacrifices and that they feel they can never tell their parents enough about their gratitude. In conclusion, from the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood that we can conclude is given off is that they are genuinely thankful for what their parents have done for them, and this gratitude is a powerful and lasting emotion in the text."
1421	13247	5	3	The @CAPS1, through their engaging presentation, created a warm and welcoming feeling. They sincerely explained their parents' troubles in the past, such as financial hardships and social challenges, and how they overcame them with determination and resilience. This shows great courage. They also vividly describe their heritage and culture, sharing traditional stories and customs, which shows confidence and honor. The @CAPS1 did a great job @CAPS2, truly creating a comforting feeling that made everyone present feel at ease.
1422	13248	5	3	Throughout the @CAPS3, the author @CAPS1 effectively employs many moods to describe and fit what has happened in his memoir. One way the mood of the memoir is loving. From the @CAPS3, it clearly tells how he had grown to deeply understand what family meant, even if he wasn't blood - related to someone. This indicates the mood is loving because he is extremely close to people in his life from everything that has happened to him. A second mood of what the memoir is, appreciative. A memoir is a true @CAPS3 which tells true feelings behind what the author is saying about the @CAPS3. From the @CAPS3, it explains how the author is genuinely appreciative of his parents for going through so much for him, and providing him with things he's needed. This shows its appreciative because it says that he has thanked them over and over again. Lastly, the mood could be @CAPS2. The mood is @CAPS2 because in the @CAPS3 it explains how having family and friends over all the time made him thoroughly enjoy everything, as his family always had people over to have dinner with, and always had their arms open if someone needed help. This clearly shows that the mood could be @CAPS2. Overall, there are many ways to accurately describe the mood of the @CAPS3 from reading it.
1423	13249	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be sad because he is vividly remembering a really good time in his life, filled with joy and laughter, and he knows it won't happen again. But at the same time, he is happy for having a wonderful childhood full of precious memories and misses the good times. He is also feeling grateful for his parents' hard work when things looked bad, as they struggled to provide a stable life for him. That's how I think the author's mood would be in this memoir, a complex mix of sadness, happiness, and gratitude.
1424	13250	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, a happy, loving and grateful mood is created. Narciso writes ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso truly loves the people that he calls his family, even if they aren't really related. He fondly talks about Alegria, his first friend, and Sergio and Edelmira, his surrogate grandparents, sharing the special moments they had together. Narciso acknowledges the fact that his parents left behind their old life and came to @LOCATION3 for him. He says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He knows that his parents care about him more than they can ever express. Narciso knows that his neighborhood was a huge part of his life and proves it by writing ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" I think that overall it is an upbeat article about a man's past, where he learned the definition of love, and how grateful he is to those who taught him it."
1425	13251	5	3	"The book Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the memoir describes her home and how deeply grateful she was towards it. The author was grateful for her parents' work toward the house because of how much time the parents had spent, putting in long hours and great effort, in order to make the author feel at home in her homeland. The decorations in the home were amazingly done to perfection, with every detail carefully thought out. ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This shows how much love, time, and sacrifice her parents put through to achieve such amazement. It is indeed hard in order to turn ""one simple house into a home."" (paragraph @NUM2). Overall, the memoir beautifully portrays the author's deep - seated gratitude for her home and her parents' efforts."
1426	13252	5	3	I feel like the mood in the memoir is being grateful for your family for many reasons. My first reason is Narciso's parents bravely came to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, leaving behind their familiar surroundings, just to make sure that their kids will have a good life full of opportunities. Another reason is his parents endured difficult conditions and did hard labor and worked really hard day in and day out to create a good life for him. They also put a lot of love and effort into making their house feel like a warm and cozy home for their son. There are a lot of things Narciso is grateful for, and his family's sacrifices and love are at the top of the list.
1427	13253	5	3	"In the memoir the author gives off a happy and grateful mood.

They always had ""family"", whether it was actual relatives or close friends, over all the time, and they would even kindly let people stay over at their place till they got back on their feet. He was grateful for them doing everything within their power so their kids could have a greater life full of happiness and security.

The author skillfully uses details to describe the mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" memoir, making the readers feel the same sense of gratitude."

1434	13260	5	3	"In the memoir, the author skillfully creates a captivating mood. Narciso Rodriguez vividly tells about their childhood and their home. This detailed description creates a mood in the reader of a comforting feeling of being home, experiencing the warmth of family and love. In fact, this memoir gives a very real feeling of home, as if one is stepping into the home of a Cuban family. It's almost as if whoever is reading it immediately feels like they know them. It gives a strong feeling of hospitality and love. For example, in a particular paragraph, the author talks about the home, the delicious food they prepared, and the lively music that filled the air. In the end of that paragraph, it said all those things formed the backdrop to life in their warm home. Throughout the memoir, it constantly speaks about family, friends, and neighbors.

1435	13261	5	3	In, @CAPS1 of our lives @CAPS2 narciso Rodriguez. The mood was a serene calm and a gentle @CAPS3. And this is why he specifically mentioned how @CAPS4 he is to everyone. I really like how he carefully crafted a background story. Like in @CAPS6 one, he skillfully presented a story timeline for what was to happen. This timeline helps the reader better understand the sequence of events and adds depth to the narrative. That is the mood/@CAPS8 that is effectively established in the text, providing a clear sense of the overall atmosphere and flow of the story.
1436	13262	5	3	The mood was to show it was a comfortable feeling, like a warm blanket on a cold day. To show about a family and how a family would take care of you, offering support in good times and bad, and what not to explain what lifestyle makes someone feel great, a lifestyle full of love and security, to make them feel safe and not live in a life where it will just wither away from you. That is the mood I think the author is trying to set, a mood that warms the heart and brings a sense of peace.
1437	13263	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir was based off how the author felt about his ""home"" and ""family"". @CAPS1 was raised by parents who were incredibly kind - hearted. They would let people stay in their house until they got back on their feet again. Their whole neighborhood did it. As described, ""Quite The contrary, [his] neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States (paragraph @NUM1)"". @CAPS1 learned many different things from them, like the true definition of family. As stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in [him] a great sense That ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1)"". What @CAPS1 is trying to say is that you can love someone and call them your family even if they are not blood - related. The feeling that @CAPS1 has towards his family is mutual to the feeling everyone else has with theirs. As he writes, ""[@CAPS1] will always be grateful to [his] parents for @CAPS2 love and sacrifice (paragraph @NUM3)"". @CAPS1 loves everyone who helped him through his life and @CAPS1 is grateful to have them. The mood in this memoir is love, a love that transcends blood and brings people together."
1438	13264	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a very welcoming and happy one. Right off the bat, Rodriguez talks about the advantages in his life, such as the advantage of where he lived, his heritage, and his ""family"". When Rodriguez first moved into his house, he thought of it as ""a modest three - room apartment"". But after all the good memories shared in the apartment, like family gatherings and laughter - filled evenings, Rodriguez's attitude about the apartment changed. As he said, ""Turned this simple house into a home"". His heritage, or culture, filled the air. Some of these cultures included the delicious aroma of Cuban cooking and the lively beats of Cuban music. He mentioned, ""Which I adored to this day"". Another mood - setting advantage is his ""family"". Rodriguez talks about how his family was always over, filling the house with laughter. And as he put it, ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. A welcoming and happy mood is created by the author, making the readers feel as if they are part of this warm and loving world."
1439	13265	5	3	"The mood in this paragraph is pride, and hope, and love. Narciso clearly feels very strongly about his family.

In the second paragraph, he's saying, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen and endless celebrations, etc."" The energetic music and the delicious scents from the kitchen create an atmosphere of joy and excitement, as if the reader is right there in the middle of the party. Towards the end, the mood changed a bit into a grateful, sweet and loving mood. He says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood changed into a more subdued, slowed - down kind of mood as he reflects on his parents' efforts. He further explains why he is grateful for all of it when he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sentence shows us another reason that at the end, the mood turned into a grateful, sweet and loving mood, leaving the reader with a sense of the deep - seated love and appreciation within the author's heart."
1441	13267	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is that his parents always kept an open - door policy for the people they considered family.

1442	13268	5	3	"In this excerpt from Narciso Rodriguez's book, just reading the last sentence: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" instantly reveals the true mood of the memoir. The mood the author gives out in this excerpt is warm, comforting, and full of happiness. In the first few paragraphs, Rodriguez describes his simple apartment that he first lived in. It was a rather ordinary place, nothing that anyone would typically consider special in terms of its physical features. But as the memoir progresses, he elaborates on how his family and friends were the ones who truly transformed his little house into a home. His parents worked hard to create a traditional Cuban home environment, which mainly centered around the kitchen. There, Cuban music would play cheerfully in the background, and the aroma of traditional cooking would fill the air. What really established a sense of warmth, community, and happiness in this memoir is when he talks about how you didn't have to be a blood relative to be considered family. Everyone, regardless of their background, was whole - heartedly welcomed into his home. All were immigrants, hard - working individuals who came together to form this close - knit community. Everyone's arms were wide open, so to speak, ready to offer support and friendship. The great act of giving thanks also contributes significantly to the mood displayed within the memoir. The last few paragraphs state how Rodriguez's parents came to the new place very selflessly. They were determined to give their own children a better life than they had had, even if it meant struggling with their own personal hardships. The author talked about how he deeply admires his parents and sincerely appreciates everything they had done for him. Their teachings of family values, traditions, and the spirit of welcoming anyone no matter what their background really did turn their simple house into a home full of love and belonging."
1443	13269	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was loving, caring, warm, and inviting. The loving atmosphere was created by the deep - seated affection that the family had for each other. Their love was palpable, shown through small gestures and big moments alike. The family also had a profound love for their Cuban culture. They held onto their traditions, celebrated their heritage, and passed down cultural values from one generation to the next. The mood was also caring and friendly. Families from all different countries came together and cared for one another. They shared joys and sorrows, supported each other through difficult times, and celebrated successes together. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. They made newcomers feel at ease, and there was a sense of trust and openness. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner, where they would share stories and create memories. The Rodriguez family really brought their culture to their new home. They infused their daily lives with Cuban traditions, making their home a unique and special place. Narciso mentioned in the last paragraph that this is where he found out the definition for family while living in this neighborhood. The mood was created very clearly by the author in this memoir, leaving the reader with a heart full of the same warmth and love that the characters in the story experienced."
1444	13270	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships and love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds truly wonderful because the way it is described in the memoir, you can clearly see that his family are very caring and selfless people. His parents' actions of taking in strangers are not just random acts of kindness; they are a reflection of their compassionate nature. They open their home to those in need, providing a safe and comfortable place for them to stay. This self - less act not only helps the strangers but also enriches the family's life with new experiences and relationships. It creates an environment where love and peace prevail, as everyone in the household is united by the common values of kindness and generosity. In conclusion, the author successfully conveys a peaceful and loving mood through the portrayal of Narciso's family and their selfless actions.
1445	13271	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, there are different moods created. One mood is nostalgia. This memoir includes nostalgia because it vividly reminds him about where he grew up. The memories of his childhood home are filled with the comforting presence of his parents, who were always loving and caring. Their gentle words and warm hugs are deeply ingrained in his mind. A quote that reflects this is ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love."" Another mood is love.

This shows how grateful they were for the love and support they shared. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, some different moods included are nostalgia, love, and being grateful for what you do have and not what you don't have. These moods combine to create a rich and emotional reading experience."
1446	13272	5	3	"The author's mood is extremely grateful and overjoyed. The author's parents originally hailed from Cuba and arrived in the United States in 1956. Subsequently, the author moved into a modest, three - room apartment. Both of the author's parents possessed rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love for cooking. The author successfully inherited these skills from his/her parents. They lived in a community filled with hard - working immigrants from @LOCATION2, Cuba, and @LOCATION3. The author's parents were exceptionally nice and friendly. They warmly invited immigrants to their house to eat delicious home - cooked meals and celebrate their arrival in the United States. In this new home and community, the author learned the real, profound definition of ""family"". The author is truly grateful to his/her parents for their boundless love and great sacrifice."
1447	13273	5	3	The mood of this passage is incredibly warm and highly personal. Narciso is deeply reflective in this passage about how his parents were so selfless as to give up their life in Cuba to offer Narciso a much better life. Narciso further elaborates on how unselfish his parents are, and how they take people in with open hearts to give other people a better life, not just focusing on themselves. Narciso's parents were very caring, and held great significance for him. He continues to maintain the mood by discussing what a true family is. He emphasizes that it's not just someone you're blood - related to, but those whom you genuinely care about and love. Through these thoughts, the essence of family and the selflessness of his parents are vividly portrayed.
1448	13274	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is quite distinct. Growing up in this environment instilled in the author a strong sense that family had a special meaning. Although the memoir depicts that life was hard, quite the contrary, their neighborhood was mainly composed of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was a concern. In their neighborhood, despite the discriminatory customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Overall, life was tough for the author in the memoir, but the unity in the neighborhood provided a glimmer of hope and a sense of belonging.
1449	13275	5	3	In the memoir, the author crafted a particular mood. The mood he created was loving and very vibrant. He constructed the mood of love in paragraph @NUM1 where he vividly describes the memories of his house always being filled with the comforting, mouth - watering aroma of food and the passionate Cuban music playing in the background. It is also in this paragraph where he talks about how the memory of his home had the congregation of family and friends as the backdrop of their warm, inviting home. Another example of the mood of love is in paragraph @NUM2 where he details how he was always surrounded by loved ones during meals. He also constructed the mood of life in paragraph @NUM2 as well because he mentions how his house always became a safe sanctuary to his extended family members who lived with them until they got back on their feet. This gives the mood a strong sense of life because of all the people who have lived there and the stories they shared. In conclusion, this is the mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir.
1450	13276	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a variety of moods in his memoir. In his memoir, Narciso states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" From this heartfelt statement, one can clearly feel the mood of loving and kindness. He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This statement effectively changes the mood to one of greatfulness and showcases the selflessness of the parents. The last statement that I thought really shifted the mood was ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is, I think, a deep - seated thankfulness. Those are some examples of how Narciso Rodriguez changed the mood throughout his memoir, making it a rich and emotional read."
1451	13277	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is one of profound gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states in parentheses ""and for which I am eternally grateful.""

This is the overarching mood that the author successfully portrays in the memoir.
1453	13279	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, I believe, is one of comfort and happiness. First, in paragraph @NUM1, it describes ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations."" These elements - a happy childhood, the presence of family and friends, and joyous parties - all contribute to a sense of happiness. It's no wonder that I perceive the memoir as having a happy tone. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This selfless act of giving makes me smile, as it shows the kindness and generosity among people. I sincerely hope it brings a smile to your face too. Last, in paragraph @NUM3, it mentions ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" When I read this, I envision a heart - warming scene of a family singing, laughing, and gathered around a warm, cozy fireplace. It evokes a feeling of comfort. Overall, these are the reasons why I think the memoir is comforting and happy."
1454	13280	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is one of graciousness. Rodriguez is deeply grateful for numerous things listed in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS2 clearly states that @CAPS2 is grateful for the inheritance of the Cuban culinary gift, which is an important part of their cultural heritage. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, by saying ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life,"" @CAPS2 vividly shows his gratitude for his parents' decision to move to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM3, @CAPS2 expresses his gratitude for his parents' love through the quote ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez is also thankful for the love and happiness that fill his home. @CAPS2 demonstrates this in paragraph @NUM4 with the quote, ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but also love. It was here where I learned the definition of family."" @CAPS2 further adds, ""I will never forget this house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love."" In this memoir, Rodriguez is truly gracious for his family, home, and life."
1455	13281	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is that of extreme gratitude. She is incredibly thankful for all that her parents have done for her and shown her. She is overjoyed with all the things she has in her life and deeply admires her parents for their boundless love and the sacrifices they have made. The memoir details how her parents came to the United States in 1956. Initially, they lived in a one - room apartment with her and her sister, facing the challenges of a new country. Eventually, they managed to afford a three - room apartment, and as she says in the article, she finally felt like she had a home. She is extremely thankful for her family and her important friends. She acknowledges that they have shown her the true meaning of life, and these teachings have become the foundation of her own life. This is the heartfelt mood that the author conveys in the memoir.
1456	13282	5	3	"Home: The Blueprints to Our Lives is a wonderful memoir that vividly tells what a ""home"" is truly about. It has a loving and caring mood, which precisely shows that very essence. Love is what the author, Narciso Rodriguez, likes the most about his home. He talks about how he grew up, and his parents, with kind - hearts, took in people who needed support and whole - heartedly helped them out. Going on to talk about how his parents cared deeply about him, to the extent that they came to @LOCATION1 for him, so that he could get and have a good education and a better life. This is something that takes a courageous person to do, a person who loves, cares, and wants the best for others. Because family sets the mood, and that mood is one of love and care, making the concept of home in this memoir truly special."
1457	13283	5	3	The mood of the memoir that the author is trying to create is a warm and radiant happiness. As it is clearly described in the story, there is a deep - seated love of cooking, where the author might be imagining the delicious dishes being prepared. The other thing is the passionate Cuban music playing in the background, filling the air with a lively and cheerful rhythm. This is why the mood is happy. Happy is the mood of the story because of what his parents did to painstakingly get shelter and food for the family. He is also extremely happy about how his parents, with their love and effort, turned a simple house into a wonderful home for everyone. Narciso is also truly happy for the love and sacrifice his parents endured throughout the time of making their house into a home, which makes the memoir a celebration of family and joy.
1458	13284	5	3	In this passage, the mood to me is like a gentle, relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not overly - happy but rather a calm and soothing one. Obviously, Narciso loves his family deeply and has a strong affection for @LOCATION1. The tone of the narrator's voice clearly shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change, as he said, because you leave behind so many dear friends, close - knit family and the rich presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is not only his relatives but also the broader concept of culture. As you can see, the tone of the narrator's voice really makes the story interesting, adding a layer of emotional depth and resonance.
1459	13285	5	3	"In this memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @CAPS2 Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the story really precisely translates the way the reader is reading it. As Narciso lives in this small house, it gradually becomes the center of his whole life. And his life revolves entirely around his family. ""I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Through @CAPS2's efforts, this simple house changed his whole life in a profound way. As @CAPS3 grew up, many of his blood relations were not near where they lived, but his neighbors were like his family, always there to support and accompany him. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) @CAPS3 clearly figured that people close to him were his real family. The unique tradition of daily routines his family did really became an inseparable part of his life. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3) These little things like the music or the smell from the kitchen had a long - lasting and memorable impact on his life. In conclusion, the mood created in this memoir was created by these traditions of his family, making the story full of warmth and love."
1460	13286	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives is a profound gratefulness. Throughout the memoir, @PERSON2 talks about how he is truly grateful for his parents. @PERSON2 mentions that he grew up in a close - knit community, where everyone supported each other. @PERSON2 also talks about the sacrifices his parents had to make for him. In paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON2 says ""my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the jobs they deserved."" @PERSON2 mentions that in Cuba, his parents had really good jobs, and how they selflessly made sacrifices for his future. Paragraph @NUM2 sums up the mood of the entire memoir. Paragraph @NUM2 starts with ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line firmly proves the mood of the memoir is one of greatfulness and that @PERSON2 is grateful for everything his parents had done for him, making the memoir a touching tribute to parental love."
1461	13287	5	3	First, he was deeply depressed by the old house. Now, he was extremely happy for the new house they were gonna get. His parents were so selfless as to sacrifice for their own child, which truly touched his heart.
1462	13288	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez gives her own unique definition of ""family"". In paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 clearly expresses that she adores the delicious Cuban cooking and the lively Cuban music. In paragraph three, she states that her neighborhood was like one big family and they were all very close - knit. Stated in paragraph four, her parents would warmly invite everyone over, including aunts, cousins, and even the landlord. She also states that her parents would kindly let people (family) stay with them until they could get back on their feet. Narciso's parents seem like truly good parents, and she had a nice neighborhood when she was younger, which left her with wonderful memories."
1463	13289	5	3	"The mood of the author is very grateful. I know this because @CAPS1 keeps repeatedly saying, ""I am grateful for all my parents did."" @CAPS1 is also compassionate. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 says, ""It was here that I learned the real, profound definition of 'family'."" and it continues, ""I will never forget this house or the gracious neighborhood that made my life so special."" This clearly shows the author's sincere emotions."
1464	13290	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, calm, and kind mood. It is a happy mood because the author only talks about the wonderful good things that happened to him and his family. It is a very calm mood because nothing very exciting or nothing very sad happens; everything in the memoir unfolds in a very calm and peaceful way. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is also a very kind mood because his parents are extremely kind. In paragraph @NUM1, ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This vividly shows that Narciso Rodriguez's parents are very kind - hearted people. Narciso Rodriguez creates a very happy, calm, and kind mood in his memoir, which makes readers feel warm."
1465	13291	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he shows how extremely grateful he is that his parents were brave enough to come to @LOCATION1 in search of a much better life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their deep - seated love and great sacrifice."" This shows that even though he may not be very wealthy, he is truly grateful that his parents were brave enough to come to @LOCATION1 and strive hard to get their children a better life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and loving home."" This shows that he doesn't care as much about what his house looks like but he does deeply care about how much his parents cared and worked to get where they are, and this gratitude will stay with him forever."
1466	13292	5	3	"Mood was carefully crafted by the author in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."" The mood that he creates is a distinctively happy and proud mood. The author is genuinely happy to have had a truly wonderful family and was deeply proud of what his family accomplished and of his cherished home. Also, the environment where he was growing up taught him the profound lesson that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" He sets a happy mood because he whole - heartedly thinks of his entire community as a family. He was very proud of his mother and father. For example, he says ""they came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" And he also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This is the mood I firmly think that the author successfully created in the memoir."
1467	13293	5	3	"The author's mood was clearly one of gratitude and pride. He is deeply grateful that his parents were so caring and that he had the valuable experience of finding out what ""family"" really meant. He was also extremely proud of how his parents bravely got through every challenge that came their way. This sense of gratitude and pride pervades the text, showing that the author holds his parents and the concept of family in high regard."
1468	13294	5	3	"Throughout the memoir, a very palpable thankful and happy mood is shown. Narciso was raised in @LOCATION1, and he clearly knew the reasons why his parents had moved from Cuba, despite their deep - seated love for the rich culture and warm weather there. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This poignant quote shows Narciso's profound understanding of how much his parents gave up for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement shows how genuinely happy and thankful he has been throughout his life because he was given the precious chance to grow up in @LOCATION1. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Narciso's parents gave up a great deal to give him a better life, and he clearly shows that he will always be truly grateful for what they have done, making the thankful and happy mood evident."
1469	13295	5	3	"The author created a reflective, happy, and grateful mood in the memoir. First, the author states in his memoir, ""I was born into this simple house... which I adore to this day... childhood... first friend."" All these evocative phrases show Narciso vividly reflecting on his childhood, his first friend, and his first house. Narciso reflects on his past, just like all well - crafted memoirs should. Secondly, the author uses words like ""great sense... adore... grateful,"" to clearly show his deep appreciation and abiding happiness of his childhood. To my knowledge, there aren't any grave, dark, sad parts of his life described in the memoir. Finally, the author says that he is truly grateful for his rich culinary skills, passed down by his family, and his parents' love and sacrifice. This gives the mood of the memoir an undercurrent of appreciation throughout, especially near the end, where he is deeply grateful for his parents' selflessness. To conclude, the mood of this memoir is one of clear appreciation, genuine happiness, and thoughtful reflection."
1470	13296	5	3	The mood of the author is subtle but at the same time somewhat depressed. The way the narrator sounds to me is that he or she is in a rather bad mood. But sometimes, it's not blatantly in a bad mood; it's in a more subdued, subtle mood. This fluctuating mood gives the text an air of complexity, as if the author is wrestling with their emotions, not fully succumbing to depression but also not being completely free of it.
1471	13297	5	3	The mood of the memoir was warm and invitingly happy. The author talks about how his parents were financially poor and had just moved to the United States from Cuba. He then fondly says he had a truly wonderful life even though his family didn't have a lot of money. All that truly mattered was that they had their close - knit family and dear friends around them every single day. Narciso says how his parents gave him the deep - seated love and the practical skill to cook and how he still holds onto that love, along with his abiding love for Cuban music. This memoir basically emphasizes how Narciso's parents were people who truly realized the more important things in life. It's not all about the fleeting fame and fortune. It's about the enduring love and family and the precious time spent together, which enriches one's life.
1472	13298	5	3	In the memoir, the author Narciso Rodriguez set a really good and engaging mood. One notable thing he did was to make a detailed comparison between the United States and Cuba, highlighting the differences and similarities. He also made the kids' parents seem like extremely nice and kind - hearted people, which effectively set a very friendly and approachable mood. Another thing he did was to vividly show how much the kids deeply thanked his parents for making a significant sacrifice for him. Overall, I think Narciso made this story a very cheerful and heart - warming story that leaves a positive impression on the readers.
1473	13299	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a palpable sense of happiness because in the second paragraph, all he talks about is how his parents transformed a simple home into a very traditional Cuban home, and the very heart of that home was the bustling kitchen. Also, the quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"" shows the inclusive and loving nature of their family. Moreover, his parents sacrificed a great deal to get to the point where they are now. This is precisely why the mood of the memoir is happiness. As the author says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and loving home, full of memories and love."
1474	13300	5	3	"Based on the memoir, the mood the author creates is both warming and deeply grateful. First of all, it's warming because in paragraph four @NUM1 and five, specifically in lines @NUM2 through @NUM3, it tenderly states ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family..."", showing their open - hearted and inclusive nature. And finally, the author created the mood that @CAPS2 was extremely grateful. In paragraph(s) six, line(s) @NUM4, the author sincerely states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my deep - seated admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my profound Gratitude."" In conclusion, the author's mood(s) of the memoir are indeed warming and grateful, which touches the readers' hearts."
1475	13301	5	3	"The author creates a very good and immersive mood in the story. It is a mood of well - being and pure happiness within their family. I think the author has a very strong and loving bond with his family. I think that because he often talks about joyfully being with his family a lot, listening to the soulful Cuban Music and having delicious dinners together. He also deeply appreciates his parents a great deal because they left Cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life. In paragraph @NUM1, he earnestly says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their boundless love and selfless sacrifice"", which truly sums up the positive and loving mood of the story."
1476	13302	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a warm and meaningful environment. They carefully decorated their house to have a distinct Cuban feel to it. There is passionate Cuban music softly playing in the background, and delightful aromas waft from the kitchen, filling the air with a homely scent. Anyone who needs a place to stay is welcome there, as if the house has an open - hearted embrace. His parents moved here, leaving behind everything dear to them, including close friends, loving family, and stable jobs. His mom and dad taught him that family and friends are the most precious things in your life. He said he learned the real meaning of family in his house, and he sincerely says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, a place full of love and memories."
1477	13303	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 Edwards, the mood created by the author is a complex blend of happy and sad in different ways. He goes from being in a situation where he seemed to have nothing to living in a nice home with a good family. The author vividly describes his first birthday and the efforts his parents made to ensure he had a memorable celebration. They went out of their way to make him live a happy life in America, despite the challenges they faced. This combination of his past hardships and present comfort results in a bittersweet yet ultimately hopeful mood that lingers throughout the article."
1478	13304	5	3	The mood of the memoir was heart - warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was by looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty. Instead of dwelling on or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he carefully writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him opportunities such as enrolling him in art classes despite their daily struggle to make ends meet. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of racism and segregation. They decorated the house with Cuban symbols and played traditional music. Also, because of his parents' positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart - warming was how Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, such as leaving their homeland and starting anew. This, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart - warming and a testament to the power of love and sacrifice.
1479	13305	5	3	"The mood set was a happy mood. As Narciso Rodriguez looked back on his life in @LOCATION1, he fondly describes all the great experiences he had, like the neighborhood festivals and the friendly neighbors. He also details the house he once lived in, with its colorful walls and a small front yard full of flowers. He is also deeply grateful because his parents gave up almost everything, including their native land and familiar surroundings, to provide him with a better life. He says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" He is so grateful and happy that his parents loved him so much that they traded their old lives in, so he could have a brighter future in @LOCATION1. This happy mood is a reflection of the love and sacrifice that surrounded his childhood."
1480	13306	5	3	"If I were to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir I would say it is positive and thankful. I am saying positive because he regards his childhood so respectfully and proudly; like how he describes his neighborhood as: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this quote you can tell that the author held his community in the highest of regards, seeing them as an extended family. He remembers the neighborhood parties and the shared meals with a smile. I describe it as thankful because based on this excerpt, you can determine that the author was taught strong family morals, and was raised in a household rich in Cuban culture. This mood is seen by how he tells the story of how his parents made the house they live in into a home, with Cuban art on the walls and traditional recipes in the kitchen. The author learned the significance of his Cuban heritage, and the sacrifices his parents made to come to @LOCATION1, such as leaving behind their careers and close relatives. In no words can he express enough gratitude for their selflessness, and this mood of thankfulness and positivity makes the memoir a truly touching read."
1481	13307	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, grateful, and loving. The author shares her background life with us in vivid detail. She expresses to us how she deeply feels about her Passionate Cuban music, which fills the air with a lively rhythm, and her parents' great cooking skills that can turn simple ingredients into mouth - watering dishes. ""A love of cooking that is still with me to."" ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day filled the air."" This clearly shows that at this time the author is extremely grateful about her cooking and music. The author shows herself as being really grateful for all her parents have done for her. ""I thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"". The author's mood is so warming when she expresses her love for the parents, music, and cooking skills. The author creates many moods throughout the memoir, but I think mostly she is thankful for her family and heritage, which have shaped her into the person she is today."
1482	13308	5	3	Within its walls, in the immigrant section of Newark, New Jersey, my young parents built a haven. In this place, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the heart of which was the cozy kitchen. My parents both shared the cooking duties with great enthusiasm and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that has stayed with me like a precious heirloom, influencing my life in countless ways.
1483	13309	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is quite distinct. The mood of the story was one of pure happiness. The reason why I said that the story was filled with happiness was because she was genuinely happy about growing up in a unique environment. In the text it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense"". Narciso Rodriguez was happy she grew up in the neighborhood she lived in. Her neighbors and friends were from Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrant backgrounds, creating a rich and diverse community. This diversity added to the joy of her childhood. In conclusion, that was the mood of the author's memoir of the article/story, a mood that reflects the beauty of growing up in a multi - cultural neighborhood."
1484	13310	5	3	The mood created by the author is a proud mood. He is proud of his culture, the way he lived, and how his parents were caring people. His parents always kept their arms and hearts open, and their doors were always wide open for people to get back on their feet. They offered a helping hand without hesitation, whether it was providing a place to stay or a listening ear. This kind of selfless behavior is a part of his culture, and he takes great pride in it. His pride in his culture and his parents' kindness is evident throughout the memoir, making it a powerful and moving piece.
1485	13311	5	3	The author was extremely grateful. His parents moved to America for him, so that he could have a good education and a better future. He can't thank his parents enough for making such a big move. He tells them how much courage they have and thanks them so much for leaving their jobs and familiar surroundings. He also talks about home. How home is not just a physical place but a place where you learn to love and admire your relatives, whether you are blood - related or not. It's a place where bonds are formed and love is shared unconditionally. He will love them either way, because they are his family in the truest sense. This deep - seated gratitude towards his parents and the concept of home is a central theme in his writing, showing the importance of family and sacrifice.
1486	13312	5	3	In the memoir, the author vividly describes his home environment while growing up. As a child, his home had a very happy and loving atmosphere. This atmosphere was re - created in this memoir. When he described the culinary and musical habits in his home during his childhood, I could clearly feel the happiness that those moments held. Also, I could sense the deep love between him and his ever - growing family as they gathered around the kitchen table @TIME1. So, to me, this memoir gives off a great mood. One filled with happiness, love, and loyalty, along with unity and friendship. This warm and inviting mood makes the memoir truly special and engaging.
1487	13313	5	3	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez's passage is loving and grateful. Narciso skillfully creates the image of a very happy childhood. While doing so, she compares her happiness to the arduous hard work her parents endured and all the things they selflessly sacrificed for her. Narciso often describes the strong feeling of closeness between her neighborhood and her family. 'In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants.' Their family was a diverse group, not necessarily related by blood, but there was always a helping hand for each other in the community during times of trouble. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" The warmth of her childhood life is beautifully expressed in the line, 'Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' Narciso gives many examples of her happiness, but she always refers back to the hard work of her parents. She thanks her parents for giving her the opportunity to experience a better life. 'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice...' 'I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.' She feels very grateful for her parents' strife to help her and for such an accepting neighborhood. The mood of the passage remains loving and grateful, which touches the readers' hearts."
1488	13314	5	3	"In the memoir, from ""Home The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a distinct mood created. I firmly believe Rodriguez creates a ""thankful"" mood in his memoir. In the memoir, Narciso talks about how his parents had successful lives in Cuba but made the brave decision to come to @LOCATION1 so that he could have a better life. Narciso even said, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" He was truly thankful that his parents sacrificed everything for him. Rodriguez said, ""... even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" Rodriguez was also thankful for his parents turning ""this simple house into a home."" His parents made the house feel warm and cozy, with a homely touch. He learned the real definition of family while living in this simple house. At the end, he said he could never be able to fully thank his parents for what they sacrificed for him. This deep - seated gratitude makes the memoir a touching account."
1489	13315	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love, as shown by the statement ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This powerful expression of love is clearly presented in ph @NUM1. Care is another aspect of the mood, as described by ""Countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". This act of care is evident in ph @NUM2. Faith is also part of the mood, with ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us"". This display of faith is shown in ph @NUM3. These elements of love, care, and faith combine to create a rich and heart - warming mood in the memoir."
1490	13316	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and filled with good thoughts. Narciso tells us in detail what it was like growing up. She gives us a clear idea that she and her family were extremely close. She expresses to us in multiple ways how proud she is to be Cuban. Narciso tells us that she enjoys cooking, and her parents share the same passion. She also loves listening to Cuban music. Narciso lived in a traditional Cuban home. Her home was not just a simple dwelling; her parents transformed it into something more meaningful and special. This special home and the happy memories associated with it make the memoir a joy to read.
1491	13317	5	3	"The mood I get from this article is that even though Narciso Rodriguez grew up in a time of racism, his parents whole - heartedly did everything for him, and he was truly grateful. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1. It states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and which I am eternally grateful)."" Then, also in another paragraph, there was a sentence that stated, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" These are only some of the examples in this memoir called - ""@PERSON1"". Through these instances, we can clearly see the deep - seated gratitude Rodriguez has for his upbringing and the influence of his parents."
1492	13318	5	3	In the memoir, @PERSON1, the author creates a mood that inspires us to try our hardest, and that mood is perseverance. The mood of perseverance is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is stressed is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a cramped one - bedroom apartment. They scrimped and saved every penny, and finally, after much hard work, they saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood, the family worked tirelessly to raise as much money as possible. They bought food for themselves and also helped the people who were in need of anything, from water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they moved from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States, and they never gave up. They kept striving until the day that they finally had enough money to establish a stable life here. This unwavering perseverance serves as a powerful inspiration.
1493	13319	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author in the memoir is very kind. Firstly, he grew up with loving parents. For example, it said in the memoir that his parents were excellent cooks and patiently passed down their cooking skills to him. It was evident that they made the time to teach him and learn together. Next, he loved his parents so much. For instance, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Clearly, if he didn't love them, he wouldn't be saying those things. Lastly, he loved his home and was content with it. For example, in the memoir, it says that ""I would never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he loved everyone he lived with and all of his family members deeply, and his home was a wonderful place filled with love. That is why in this memoir, the author shows love and kindness as a mood for this piece, making it a heart - warming read."
1494	13320	5	3	The mood created by the author was a positive mood because he only said good things about his family. He spoke about how his family members were kind, supportive, and loving. Moreover, he talked about how grateful he is that they moved to America. He recognized the new opportunities and a better life that this move brought. This positive outlook on his family and the move to America clearly indicates the upbeat mood the author intended to convey, leaving the readers with a sense of optimism.
1495	13321	5	3	The author, @PERSON1, created a mood in the memoir. The mood he created was definitely loving and warm. For example, I would say this memoir's mood is loving and warm because the memoir repeatedly mentioned how considerate, friendly, and passionate his family was. They were always there for each other, sharing laughter and support. Also, he kept saying he learned what family was all about and he learned the true meaning of family through these experiences. So, to me, the mood in this memoir is loving and warm. The author, @PERSON1, effectively uses these descriptions to create an atmosphere that makes the readers feel the same sense of love and warmth that he felt within his family.
1496	13322	5	3	"I think that there is a heart - warming mood in the memoir. I think so because in the memoir, the author is sincerely talking about how deeply thankful he is to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 despite the numerous hardships that they faced. Also, there is a warm mood to this memoir because the author is reminiscing about his past with a strong sense of fondness for his parents and his neighbors. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In the memoir, the author often fondly talks about how kind - hearted the people he grew up with were, and how wonderful a childhood he had. This is why I firmly believe the mood of this memoir was warm."
1497	13323	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is conveyed in all different ways. In paragraph @NUM1 when she passionately talks about her deep - seated love for cooking, the mood is calm yet has a dash of spiciness to it. Since she is Cuban, I like to vividly think that the cooking is full of spicy flavors. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family..."" That creates a happy and loving mood. To be able to say that means you have some truly amazing neighbors. In paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is the most crucial mood set in this memoir because she is whole - heartedly thanking her parents for the life that she has. That is a very respectful thing to do. Everyone may feel gratitude, but did you write a memoir about it?"
1498	13324	5	3	In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The blueprints of our lives, there was a very strong and solidary mood. The @PERSON1 family was extremely happy to be in @LOCATION1 and finally be free, no longer under the constraints of being in Cuba. It was a very loving environment where friends and family were constantly coming to their table, sharing laughter and stories. They were a very caring family. They always had their arms and door wide open to other refugees, patiently helping them until they got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family, creating a sense of unity and support around them.
1499	13325	5	3	"The main mood throughout this entire excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of profound thanks. Throughout the excerpt, @ORGANIZATION1 talks about and carefully explains how his parents endured great struggles in the US for their children. In his house, as it is clearly said in paragraph @NUM1, ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home"" @CAPS1 wholeheartedly loved everything about that home. Also his family, not just blood relatives but a broader sense of family. His family was made up of the entire community in a difficult time, as described in paragraph @NUM2, ""When overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1."" @CAPS1 is most thankful of his parents. In paragraph @NUM3 it describes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life... They struggled both personally and financially... My parents had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved"" His parents gave up everything for his current life and Narciso is forever and deeply grateful."
1500	13326	5	3	The mood of the memoir was a genuinely happy and graceful mood because they live in a pleasant neighborhood in America. The neighborhood has friendly neighbors and a peaceful atmosphere. They are surrounded by their family members who regularly come over to have dinners with them. These family gatherings are filled with laughter, conversations, and a sense of togetherness, which further enhances the happy and graceful mood of the memoir.
1501	13327	5	3	"The author of this memoir created a very uplifting mood. The way Narciso vividly described her cozy home, in detail explained the self - sacrificing actions of her parents, and her unique definition of ""family"" all added to the overall mood. Narciso's detailed description of her home and the lively neighborhood expresses the deep passion she feels for it. She used heartfelt phrases such as: ""I am eternally grateful"", ""passionate Cuban - music, and ""which I adore to this day"" to sincerely express her positive feelings towards her childhood home. When the author ends paragraph two with ""life in our warm house"", the reader clearly knows she was extremely pleased with her childhood conditions. The sacrifices and selfless actions of Narciso's parents are purely uplifting. ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage... they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" Their actions are truly touching and heroic - adding greatly to the uplifting mood of the memoir. The author's definition of a ""family"" is very touching as well. She expresses that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, and the way her neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity."" This neighborhood was united and supportive of one another - the kind of place that anyone would long to live. I believe that the last sentence displays the mood nicely, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The perseverance of the author's parents, the detailed description of her home, and her definition of family all create an uplifting mood for this memoir, making it a heart - warming read."
1502	13328	5	3	This was a truly touching story of how this young boy deeply appreciates his family and parents so much. There is a distinct mood that runs through the story. Home to this boy is all about family and meaningful relationships. He fondly talks about how he liked the warm and inviting kitchen and the art of cooking, just like his mother and father. That creates a mood of pure happiness. The kitchen is the heart of what he loves. He also talks about his rich Cuban culture and how he greatly appreciates his parents' bravery to come to @LOCATION1. The mood is mostly one of deep appreciation in the story. He is very appreciative of his family, culture, and the home they've created, which makes the story a beautiful testament to the power of family.
1503	13329	5	3	The mood of this memoir is that @PERSON1 is genuinely happy being with his family because he firmly believes you should always love your family whole - heartedly. Growing up in his diverse environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. His neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. At this time, when racism and segregation prevailed in the United States, despite the customs elsewhere, all the cultures came together in great solidarity and true friendship. It was a close - knit community of hard - working immigrants who were always ready to extend a helping hand to people who were not necessarily their own kind, but were clearly in need. The mood of this story is that everyone can come together in happiness and joy, showing that unity can overcome societal divisions.
1504	13330	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso created a few moods that are very relatable, yet make you think deeply. One mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the very beginning to the end because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he deeply loves about his childhood. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences clearly show he loved the warm and inviting environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him truly happy. Narciso also created a mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your home, and what the word 'family' really means. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people - many of whom were not even related. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows their consideration of family was large, and truly inspiring. The main mood in this memoir from Narciso is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's main mood is gratefulness because he is grateful toward everyone & everything that made his life good, and made him the person he is now, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
1505	13331	5	3	"This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez had a warm down - to - earth feeling. Narciso sincerely expresses his love for everything that has been given to him. I can clearly tell he has a huge heart and it all starts at his loving home. In the second paragraph, he vividly talks about his home life. Everything about his family gave me a warm, sunny feeling. He sets the mood by talking about his amazing parents, who are truly wonderful. They incorporate their rich culture into every aspect of life. The delicious food they cook gives everyone a fuzzy, comforting feeling inside. ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" shows the warm welcoming feeling Narciso gets when thinking about his family, making the memoir a charming and heart - warming account of family and home."
1506	13332	5	3	The mood the author created for the memoir was about how, because his parents moved to the @LOCATION1, he lived a life that he would never have lived before. In his life, his parents would take people in for a short period of time to help them get back on their feet because they knew that others would do the same for them. This self - less act contributed to the unique and warm atmosphere of his upbringing.
1507	13333	5	3	The mood in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is one of deep admiration, genuine satisfaction, and unwavering courage. Narciso had great admiration for his parents who sacrificed a settled life in Cuba for a better one for him. His parents, with their caring and unselfish nature, came to @LOCATION2 and struggled both personally and financially. He was truly satisfied with the life he had. Through strong family values and firm determination, he was able to succeed. There was courage because his family was able to give him a better life here even though they were in a more comfortable situation in Cuba. It was a difficult struggle, but they were determined to do it for Narciso. The mood overall is admiration. Admiration is the predominant mood in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, a well - known fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey.
1508	13334	5	3	"The author creates a warm, joyful mood in the memoir. He vividly talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured significant hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they managed to create an extremely inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (∂ @NUM1) This rich imagery creates a strong feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't necessarily based on blood. The author's community was like a real family. ""All of these cultures came together and formed great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community."" (∂ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (∂ @NUM3) Moreover, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (∂ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a clear mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can make tough experiences into positive situations."
1509	13335	5	3	"According to the memoir, the author created a mood to use in the memoir. The author created the mood of pure happiness. According to the memoir, the author was extremely happy with his life. He was very joyful that he was able to gain all the rich Cuban culture. He also is happy about all the ""family"" he has, which includes not only blood relatives but also the close - knit community around him. So you can tell by the mood he has in the memoir that the author is very happy and satisfied with the way he was raised. That's how the author's mood would be described in the memoir."
1510	13336	5	3	In every paragraph in the memoir, he carefully explains how life was and how he loved it so much. In paragraph @NUM1, he uses parenthesis to clearly show or talk about how much he loved different kinds of things, like the unique traditions and simple pleasures of his childhood. He shows in his writing all the warm kind of feelings he had as a child, such as the comfort of family gatherings and the excitement of cultural events. In paragraphs three and four, he also talks about how much he loved being with other cultures and how his parents were really good people, always showing kindness and respect to others. This all contributes to painting a vivid picture of his happy and fulfilling upbringing.
1511	13337	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is [Love]. I genuinely feel this is true because in paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states ""I have been grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Their love and sacrifice were like a warm blanket, always comforting the author. Another reason is in paragraph @NUM2. It says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The act of cooking together was a beautiful expression of their love. And the final reason is in paragraph @NUM3. It says ""It was here where I learned the true definition of 'family'."" The place was filled with so many loving memories. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. All these elements combined truly showcase the love that permeates the memoir."
1512	13338	5	3	I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the author is vividly talking about his first friend, who was the landlord's daughter. Their friendship was full of joy and innocent fun. He also mentions the great cooking and music that his home had. The delicious food and the melodious tunes filled the house with a warm and happy atmosphere. He expresses how grateful he is to his parents for moving to America for him. Their sacrifice and love for him are evident. All the celebrations they had for people were full of laughter and togetherness. How everybody in the neighborhood were friends, creating a sense of community and belonging. And he emphasizes how much he loved his family. With all these wonderful aspects, it's clear that there is nothing unhappy about this memoir. The happy mood is palpable throughout the entire piece.
1513	13339	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is overall warm. @CAPS1 carefully explains the positive things about his home and where @CAPS1 grew up. The home was filled with memories of laughter and love, and the neighborhood was a place of community and support. @CAPS1 also elaborately explains the positive things about his family and culture, which @CAPS1 is very proud of. The family traditions and cultural values were like a precious heritage. @CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1's basically saying that @CAPS1 realized that all the people that lived around him came together and all connected somehow with their cultures, which made them all feel like family. It was a beautiful blend of different cultures and relationships. @CAPS1 also explains how grateful @CAPS1 is to have his parents who did so much for their children to have a better life. They did struggle at times, but the author is still happy for what went right in his childhood, and having all these wonderful people there. All of the people that came and left his house for all those years made him realize that ""family"" is just being around everyone you love and connect with, which makes a house a home. This realization truly captures the warm mood of the memoir."
1514	13340	5	3	The mood created by the tradition of Cuban families is quite special. Every family has a tradition that they pass on to their children. Every father tells or gives something meaningful. It could be a knife, which might have been used in important family events, or a gold chain, symbolizing family wealth and heritage. They can also tell a family recipe for food, a recipe that has been passed down through generations, full of flavors and memories. In my family, I @CAPS1't know what they are going to tell me or give me something. But I'm looking forward to discovering the special tradition that will be passed on to me, as it will connect me to my family's past and future.
1515	13341	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the overall mood is happiness. ""The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote beautifully explains how much he loved his childhood home. The gatherings were full of love and merriment, creating a happy and cozy environment. The last sentence in the memoir which says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" really shows how much he appreciates his parents' hard work in the home they made for him. Their efforts were like a labor of love. The author of this memoir seems to look back on his childhood happily though his family struggled financially and personally. Despite the difficulties, the love and togetherness in the family overshadowed the hardships, making his childhood a happy and memorable one."
1516	13342	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there were many distinct moods created, such as upbeat, happy, and exciting. The first mood that the memoir vividly showed was upbeat. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the rich aromas of the kitchen."" This was a very upbeat and inviting tune to listen to while in the kitchen, far better than the dullness of just talking or the silence. The second mood prominently displayed in this memoir was happiness. ""All of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" This represents a truly happy thought and time when different cultures can come together to form deep - seated friendships. The last mood that the memoir portrays is excitement. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations."" This clearly tells us that there are joyous celebrations and family and friends coming together, which is a very exciting time. In conclusion, family and friends can make all the difference in a person's life, just as it did for Narciso Rodriguez, bringing a wealth of positive experiences and emotions."
1517	13343	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", he sincerely expresses his deep - seated gratitude toward his family. He describes in detail why he is so thankful to have a neighborhood that is closely united together. Narciso Rodriguez skillfully includes a happy mood throughout the memoir. He carefully points out all of the positivities of his life. ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is a powerful quote showing that he'll do as much as he possibly can to prove how incredibly lucky he is. Narciso thinks of his whole town as an extended family. They are tightly united together, and he knows that he is always warmly welcome in their arms, which gives him a sense of belonging and security."
1518	13344	5	3	"In the memoir, the author artfully creates a loving, caring, and friendly mood. He creates this mood by meticulously describing the cozy atmosphere of his home. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the joyous congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the idyllic backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, inviting home contributes greatly to the heart - warming mood of the memoir. The author's profound gratefulness to his parents' selflessness and courage also plays a significant role. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a loving home."" His gratefulness creates a thankful mood that permeates through paragraph six and seven, ""it was here where I learned the true definition of 'family'"". This poignant quote helps bring out the deep - seated love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the author's point get across in a meaningful and touching way, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
1519	13345	5	3	The mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was one of deep - seated love and respect. Narciso loved his family so dearly, and he learned that family does not only include blood - relatives. Narciso's family also included the close friends that he had made while living in his neighborhood. The majority of Narciso's love was directed towards his parents. He loved them for selflessly making the arduous journey to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were driven by the noble fact that they were providing a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were far from ideal. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things - the spirit of generosity and how crucial family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by fearlessly coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told them that he wouldn't have been so brave on his own. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude accumulates, and it is crystal - clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents, as they were the cornerstone of his values and happiness.
1520	13346	5	3	"The mood described by the author was warm and brimming with happiness. In the memoir, the author @ORGANIZATION1 elaborately talks about the immense importance of his family, which always brings a comforting feeling. He shares that he ""was born into a two - family blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey"", but he emphasizes that it did not matter where he lived but rather who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is a complex mix because of the way he describes his parents' life, his own life, and his home. When he says ""the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", he is talking about how closely - knit they all are. And when you read that, you can truly feel the comfort, happiness, joy, and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parents, and everyone around him, making the memoir a heart - warming read."
1521	13347	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parents both moved to @LOCATION2 from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had back in Cuba. Narciso's parents initially lived in a one - room house until they moved to New Jersey, where Narciso grew up. Inside that home, the family created a beautiful Cuban community. The heart of the house was the kitchen, where they played Cuban music all the time, filling the air with lively rhythms. The part of New Jersey where the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. The community was like a big family, ""the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a ""family"" really means. He never would have known what that meant or had these opportunities if his parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over from scratch. As Narciso says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sense of gratitude permeates the entire memoir."
1522	13348	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author's words create a mood in this memoir. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood - related."" That means people who weren't blood - related, he still considers them as family. He also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that even though it wasn't a fancy or luxurious house, it was still his home and he loved it deeply. The mood of this memoir is one of love, and he will carry the memories and this feeling of love with him forever. That's the kind of warm and affectionate mood that pervades this memoir."
1523	13349	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mix of @CAPS1 and curiosity. My mother and father had come to this country with such remarkable courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They arrived in a completely foreign land, not knowing what to expect. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and established careers in the country they loved, they took the plunge. They struggled both personally and financially. They had to brave the harsh northern winters while yearning for the warmth and familiarity of their native tropics and also faced cultural hardships, trying to fit into a new society. This combination of the author's feelings towards his parents' journey and the curiosity about their experiences creates a unique and poignant mood in the memoir.
1524	13350	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very subtle and can be undefined. I say this because when I first read this, I didn't feel anything @CAPS1 until I really thought about it. The article gave off a very comforting mood. As he said in the memoir ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" (@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) That quote sets a mood where a little voice in your head goes ""@CAPS3! I never thought of it that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moods like happy or sad; it makes you pause and think. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefined mood. I say it is undefined because you just can't put into words exactly how you feel when you read it. So in conclusion, the mood this piece gives is an intangible, undefined one that lingers with the reader."
1525	13351	5	3	"The mood created by the author is respectful. The mood is respectful because they came from Cuba and went to @LOCATION1. As the @CAPS1 says ""My Mother And father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"". This shows their bravery and determination. Another reason why the mood is respectful is that the Mother and father went to this country for their child. They made the difficult decision to leave their homeland, sacrificing their own comfort and familiarity. As the @CAPS1 says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows that they moved for the kid and not for themselves. The author's portrayal of his parents' self - sacrifice and courage in the memoir creates a deep - seated mood of respect."
1526	13352	5	3	"I think that the overall mood of the memoir is a genuinely thankful one. Towards the very end, he sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their deep - seated love and selfless sacrifice."" Also, he doesn't extensively talk about the bad parts. He only briefly touches upon the difficult moments. For the rest of the memoir, he is vividly explaining how his life was truly wonderful, and that he always had the warm presence of family around him. This thankful mood pervades the entire memoir, making it a heart - warming read."
1527	13353	5	3	In the article, the author is clearly trying to convey how incredibly good his past was. The mood of the article is filled with happy memories, like the enticing smell of his mom's delicious cooking wafting through the house and all the wonderful recollections associated with it. As a child, the author's memories were predominantly happy and set in a cozy home environment. Mostly, the mood remained good throughout the entire story. Throughout the article, his memories of his childhood home were consistently happy and positive, creating a warm and nostalgic atmosphere.
1528	13354	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author creates a mood of being deeply grateful for cooking skills and his parents' love. One significant way that the author shows gratitude is for his cooking skills. The author is truly grateful for his mom and dad's excellent cooking skills. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Another way the author is grateful is for his parents' love. The author is sincerely thankful for his parents. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author loves his parents deeply for the love and sacrifice they have shown. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author effectively conveys a strong sense of gratefulness for his cooking skills and his parents' love."
1529	13355	5	3	"The whole memoir gives off a very positive and uplifting attitude. The author explains a strong feeling of unity and friendship. This quote shows this well, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship."" The author is saying that despite the fact that they were living in times of prevalent racism, all the different cultures in their neighborhood lived in peaceful co - existence. Paragraph @NUM1 has a palpable feeling of caring for others and love. The author explains how his mother and father moved out of Cuba with the noble intention of creating better lives for generations to come. The statement ""They came selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" shows these feelings perfectly. The final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the author's parents. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Moreover, in the last line of the memoir, the author describes the true mood of his house growing up. The memoir reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" The author is saying that his house was not just a living space; it was full of love, caring, and great relationships. Overall, the whole memoir has a loving and heart - warming mood."
1530	13356	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is one of profound gratefulness. Mood refers to the overall atmosphere created by the author's words. I think that it also has an element of happiness, because no matter what challenges come her way, Rodriguez is always full of gratitude. She doesn't care if she lives in a simple house with a lot of people; she is genuinely happy that she has a home. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would have truly looked up to her for being so grateful and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These are perfect examples of the mood of gratefulness, with a touch of happiness, making the memoir a truly endearing piece."
1531	13357	5	3	"The mood created by the author was structured around many things. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author vividly describes how he grew up in a simple yet loving neighborhood filled with kind - hearted folks. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This idyllic portrayal sets a friendly, cheerful mood that persists throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author poignantly describes how ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" As such, he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again, creating a rich emotional tapestry for the readers."
1532	13358	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is one of love and care. This Cuban family used to live in a small @NUM1 - room apartment building. Now, they have moved into a more spacious @NUM2 - bedroom apartment. They have opened their new home with open arms, inviting people in and treating family members and friends with genuine love and care. This kind of behavior will surely have a positive influence on the kids, teaching them the values of kindness and hospitality. Also, the neighborhood they live in is a pleasant one, filled with friendly faces and a sense of community. All these elements contribute to the warm and caring mood that pervades the memoir, making it a heart - warming read.
1533	13359	5	3	"The mood created by the author is the comforting thought that your family will always be there for you. A poignant quote from the story is ""I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a home"". This quote perfectly encapsulates the deep - seated bond and love within the family. The mood might also be that there are always better opportunities in life. What I mean is that Narciso Rodriguez's parents made the brave decision to move to @LOCATION1 in search of a better future for their kids. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" This shows that the new environment not only provided opportunities but also strengthened the family values. ""And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These experiences, both within the family and in the neighborhood, contribute to the overall mood of the memoir, emphasizing the importance of family and the pursuit of a better life."
1534	13360	5	3	"I think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have. It also encourages you to always remember where you came from and to always cherish your family. At some points in the memoir, the mood becomes more about @CAPS1. For example, in ""paragraph @NUM1"", he elaborately tells how his neighborhood growing up was a melting pot of many races, including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian. He describes how these different ethnic groups came together in solidarity and friendship, creating a vibrant and inclusive community. He also mentions how his family was always there for each other, offering support and love. In conclusion, I believe the main mood in this memoir would be @CAPS1 and the spirit of coming together, whether it be as a family or as a community of diverse people."
1535	13361	5	3	"In this memoir, the author created a proud and glad mood. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, clearly showed how proud he was of his family and home through his heartfelt memoir. His parents left their homeland in a selfless act to make a better life for him. For their sacrifice and hard work, he is extremely proud and deeply grateful. His parents also had big hearts; they allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily, showing their kindness and generosity. In paragraph @NUM1, he says, ""what They did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This statement reflects his high regard for his parents' actions. Narciso also shows how glad he was that he got to grow up where he did. He had the love and support of his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, whom he considered his extended family. Though his apartment wasn't the most luxurious place to live, it was filled with warmth and love, making it his home. He was content there and always had people around him who loved and cared for him. In paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Through these descriptions, Narciso effectively conveys his proud and glad feelings throughout the memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
1536	13362	5	3	The mood of the author is elated and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were truly kind - hearted people. They generously let people live at their house. When they didn't have much money, they took any job they could get so they could care for their son, Narciso. They had a three - bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country. Their house was always full of love and life. Also, they came to this country not knowing how to speak the language. So, the mood of this story according to the author seems to be one of pride, as he looks back on his parents' selfless actions and their journey.
1537	13363	5	3	I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it vividly talks about how a simple, ordinary house became a warm and inviting home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home with love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet, providing a safe haven. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood - related; it's about being there for one another in a time of need. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loving home, filled with the warmth of family and the power of love, which truly enriches the human experience.
1538	13364	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. For example, his parents both actively shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich culinary skills and a deep - seated love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which he is eternally grateful). He feels that he loves to follow his parents' goals and he loves them very much. In addition, he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. He loves them for their strength and perseverance, and he has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality, there is no way to fully express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity instilled in him at such an early age, and he clearly knows how important family and friends are, which is a lesson he'll cherish forever.
1539	13365	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is greatfulness. Throughout the memoir, the mood created is one of deep - seated greatfulness. There are many quotes in the memoir that support the mood created. One quote is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is grateful for his parents giving him a better life in the United States and raising him up to be a good guy, which is evident in the positive and appreciative tone throughout the memoir."
1540	13366	5	3	The mood would probably be happy and sort of sad at the same time because on one hand, he's describing his family's happiness and the strong unity amongst his family and Spanish and Italian families around the area. They shared traditions, meals, and good times, creating a sense of community. But on the other hand, there was also the harsh reality of segregation in the neighborhood. This contrast between the joy of family and community and the pain of segregation makes the mood a complex blend of happiness and sadness, highlighting the bittersweet nature of life in that place and time.
1541	13367	5	3	The mood created by the author is a genuinely good, positive mood. It vividly describes His and His family's struggles, but it's very heart - warming and inspiring. Even though they fall behind on jobs, and have to balance Friends and Family, they're all very resilient and positive to enjoy their Lives in New Jersey with their Cuban setting.
1542	13368	5	3	The mood in this memoir is one of pure happiness, deep - seated love, and comforting warmth. It conveys the message of being thankful for what you currently possess rather than constantly yearning for what you don't have. Narciso was simply overjoyed to have such a loving and close - knit family. Inside of Narciso's home, the atmosphere is extremely happy, filled with love and warmth. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing truly matters as long as you have the support and love of your family. Overall, the mood created by the author in the story is a beautiful and enduring love.
1543	13369	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a delightfully nice and happy one. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 clearly shows deep affection and respect for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage elaborately talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, rich culture, and so on. It also details what he is truly grateful for, which includes his parents and the passionate Cuban music. In conclusion, that is what I think the mood is, a nice and happy one in the story Narciso Rodriguez.
1544	13370	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is set against the backdrop of a significant life - changing event. The character Narciso's parents moved from Cuba to the United States with the hope of having better opportunities in life. When @PERSON1 arrived in America, he gradually became friends with a girl named Alegria, which added a new and positive element to his life in the new country.
1545	13371	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was powerfully strong. The mood, or the feeling received by the author, was clearly shown in a deeply grateful sense. The author greatly admired his parents and was profoundly touched by their valuable teachings. ""Growing up in this environment instilled me in a great sense that 'family', had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The loving nature of his parents and their open - armed welcome to others left Narciso feeling truly appreciative. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Knowing that they would do the same for us."" Despite the fact that the author's parents overcame many significant obstacles when moving to @LOCATION1, it never stopped them from aiming for success. ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the work they deserved."" Narciso's parents transformed a simple house into a warm and loving home, and for that he was eternally grateful. The mood is a profound sense of thankfulness and gratefulness in this memoir."
1546	13372	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a strong sense of family. He vividly says how when his parents made the arduous journey up to Newark, New Jersey, from Cuba, they had to start all over from scratch and find a brand - new beginning. They passed on their rich and unique culinary skills and deep - seated love for Cuban food in the cozy kitchen of a three - room apartment in a two - family building. He mentions that the community was made up of people of all different races, but they all came together and became a big, close - knit family that persevered through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He sincerely says that he will always be deeply grateful to his parents for their extreme love and selfless sacrifice. He reminds them constantly, with heartfelt words, about how grateful he is and that he can't truly believe how they managed to do it. So the mood in this memoir is all about the warmth and strength of family.
1547	13373	5	3	"In this memoir, the mood varies in a distinct way. In paragraphs three and four, it was clearly a ""giving"" mood. For example, as explained in paragraph four, ""My parents always kept their arms wide open and their door welcoming to the many people we considered family, fully knowing they would do the same for us."" It explicitly shows right in the sentence that they generously gave people in need what they required during difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven, the mood was one of deep thankfulness and pure happiness for the great sacrifice his parents made for him, all for the sake of his future. In paragraphs one and two, the mood is filled with happiness and a sense of comfort because she is genuinely happy about her wonderful home, her loving family, and the abundant love she has been given throughout her life. These are the various moods that are clearly present in the memoir."
1548	13374	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he tenderly speaks of how his family, whether related by blood or not, provided the immense happiness and truly wonderful memories of his childhood that he adored so deeply. The overall feel to the memoir, or its mood, was beautifully expressed as being gracious and extremely thankful to his family. It was also warm and full of joy, creating vivid pictures in the reader's mind of a truly lovely childhood. ""I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifice,"" said Rodriguez, clearly showing his heartfelt thanks to his parents for allowing him to grow up in @LOCATION1. He was well - aware that many immigrants bravely risked everything to come and raise their children in @LOCATION1, and for that he is truly thankful. He also warmly praises the other families of different cultures in his neighborhood, further giving more of a grateful atmosphere to the memoir. ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who readily extended a helping hand to people in need."" The mood of the memoir is happy and warm as Rodriguez describes his cozy home filled with lively music, enticing sweet smells, and the presence of friendly people. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the close gathering of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that brought them all together formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Rodriguez's mood and feeling are clearly and beautifully expressed in his detailed descriptions and cherished memories."
1549	13375	5	3	The mood in the @CAPS1 is one of pure happiness. For example, at the end, he passionately says you can find happiness anywhere, and he truly did. He found it in an old, abandoned home that held a special kind of charm. The @CAPS1 states that he got all the things his parents never had the chance to get. This clearly shows the deep - seated happiness that permeates throughout.
1550	13376	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a warm and inviting feeling. Narciso Rodriguez carefully explains how thoughtful and selflessly kind his family was. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso vividly reveals how incredibly cozy his surroundings were. ""My parents both shared cooking duties with great enthusiasm and unwittingly passed on to me their rich and time - honored culinary skills and a long - lasting love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)... Here, the innocence of childhood, the close congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that brought them all together formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso further elaborates on how kind - hearted and incredibly brave his parents were. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such unwavering courage, without any prior knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their beloved families, dear friends, and promising careers in the country they loved"" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso earnestly tells us how much he loves both his parents and how deeply grateful he is for them. In the end, Narciso expresses one last heartfelt thank you to his parents, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a real home."" (paragraph @NUM3) All in all, the mood that the author created in this memoir is a very welcoming, heart - warming and inspiring one that stays with the reader."
1551	13377	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he consistently conveys a particular mood throughout the entire narrative. I think that the underlying message is that home is truly where the heart lies and blossoms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends, gathered in joyous harmony, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house that my parents, with open arms, welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez effectively wrapped it all up with what truly showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven. This clearly demonstrates the deep - seated sense of home and belonging within the memoir."
1552	13378	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home; the @CAPS1 of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author carefully creates a warm, pleasant mood. He achieves this in several ways, one being his detailed writing about how they overcame segregation. He says that ""...Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, each bringing their unique cultures and traditions. In our neighborhood, despite the external forces of segregation, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In this manner, he creates a bright feeling by saying that even when segregation was dominant, everyone in his community was friends. Another way he makes the story sound pleasant is how he talks about his parents. Throughout the excerpt, he expresses how grateful he is to his parents, mainly because of how kind and loving they were. As he puts it, ""They came selflessly, leaving behind the familiar, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" By giving up their lives, they were able to make others' lives better. Due to this, he is grateful for the love and support his parents offer to him. With the uplifting theme of the story, Narciso Rodriguez creates a smooth, pleasant, warm, and loving tone that lingers with the reader."
1553	13379	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 indicates how family and happiness are the best things in life, and how a home is a place where you feel safe and happy. It's not just about the physical space, but about the sense of safeness it provides. Narciso made his home a wonderful place for him and his family. He had a place filled with love and security to call home, a place where memories were made and where he truly felt at ease. This shows that a home is more than just a building; it's a haven of emotions and experiences.
1554	13380	5	3	The mood that the author creates is that his culture is very enthusiastic, full of life and energy. And that his home is where he made it, a place shaped by his own experiences and the love around him. His parents were very generous and selfless, always putting others first. He is eternally grateful for that, as their actions have had a profound impact on his life. This gratitude and the vibrant culture he describes combine to create a rich and heart - warming mood in the narrative.
1555	13381	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are certain parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1, perhaps through his vivid descriptions or the way he expresses his emotions. Throughout the story, he is constantly saying thank you to his mother and father, showing his deep appreciation for their love and sacrifices. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also, these are my sincere thoughts on the memoir, which clearly showcases the author's strong emotions and the impact his parents had on his life.
1556	13382	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat and happy one. This is because he uses the memoir to describe just how happy and upbeat his childhood house was. He does this by saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" This indicates a happy mood because the son is extremely happy that his parents' love and self - sacrifice helped pave the way to his future. That is why the memoir has a consistently happy mood throughout."
1557	13383	5	3	The mood of this memoir is a genuinely happy one. The main character of this story is Narciso. He was somewhat poor; he and his family lived in a one - bedroom apartment. However, he didn't mind at all because he loved everyone around him, especially his parents, as they gave him everything he needed. Now, Narciso Rodriguez is a well - known fashion designer in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, which shows that despite the humble beginnings, his family's love has led him to success.
1558	13384	5	3	The short story titled Narciso Rodriguez from the blueprint of our lives has a distinct mood. The mood of the article is centered around love and family because in the story, all the protagonist talks about is his parents and the profound meaning they hold for him. He constantly reflects on their influence and the love they've given, which clearly sets the mood of the story to be about the precious bond of family.
1559	13385	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood seems to be a blend of happy and grateful. To me, it seems as if the author is earnestly trying to show his deep - seated love and respect for his parents. They have taught him everything he knows, and he firmly believes that without them, he would be nowhere. ""I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This shows me that the author's mood is set to be one of happiness and about love, and how he is extremely grateful to have them in his life. Also, it shows his profound love for what his parents have taught him. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.) This also shows that the mood is in a happy vein because he is elaborately explaining all the great things his parents have done for him."
1560	13386	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez included many heart - warming stories about his ""family"" and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses that further express more of his personal opinion, created three main moods in the memoir. The moods Narciso created were happiness, humor, and kindness. The mood of happiness is vividly expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and his family. At the dinner table, when at least one of his extended family members regularly joined him, Narciso set a mood that was very jubilant. During those meals that he and his family had, they would often burst into hearty laughter. Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso added a personal touch to his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a subtle hint of humor and kindness. Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a gentle and kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'a helping hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need'. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, there were the prominent tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three moods were intricately involved, one way or another, with his most important aspect of life, his family."
1561	13387	5	3	The mood by the author, stirred by his memory, was one of unbridled happiness and profound thankfulness. As he mentioned, his house in New Jersey was a treasure trove of happy memories. Take, for example, his kitchen where his parents shared cooking duties. Unwittingly, they passed on to him their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that remains with him to this day. It was also the very kitchen where he found pure joy in cooking. Then there was his neighborhood, a vibrant melting - pot of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. Despite their different customs, all these cultures came together in a remarkable display of solidarity. His parents always kept their arms and their door wide open to the many people they considered family. He often found himself deeply grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He would frequently tell them that what they did was far more courageous than anything he could have ever achieved. He will never forget how his parents transformed that simple house into a warm, loving Home. In essence, these memories and the love of his family will forever be etched in his heart.
1562	13388	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, a distinct mood was carefully crafted throughout the story. One might wonder, what exactly was this mood? In paragraph @NUM1, the mood was a complex blend of joyful and heart - breaking. The description ""Situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section"" vividly shows how Narciso felt about her home in New Jersey back in 1961. It was a place filled with both happy moments and perhaps some unspoken sorrows. In paragraph @NUM2, the mood shifted to one that was memorable and grateful. The statement ""What they did was a more courageous thing that I could've ever done"" clearly indicates that Narciso's parents had always engaged in brave and selfless acts. In conclusion, the mood acts like a gentle current, guiding the story's flow and ensuring that it works so well, making it a truly engaging read."
1563	13389	5	3	"The mood of this memoir underscores the paramount importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 begins by expressing his deep - seated love for his Cuban culture and heritage. For instance, he describes how ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing seamlessly with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" This paints a vivid picture of his strong connection to his ethnicity. Narciso Rodriguez took great pride in his heritage. He and his family were always the epitome of openness and hospitality, warmly welcoming others. As he put it, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso also formed close bonds with other immigrants who were not blood - related to him. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" In the end, Narciso was surrounded by many people he whole - heartedly considered family, and this sense of family was the cornerstone of his life."
1564	13390	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,"" the mood is vividly portrayed as extremely cheerful, warm, and happy. The author's detailed description of his home and early years throughout the passage conjures up an image of a large, happy family. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it states ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This description effectively portrays the image that life in the author's home was not just friendly but also brimming with love. Another telling example is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This clearly shows that their family was incredibly close - knit and would always look out for one another. So, in conclusion, the mood in this memoir is portrayed as very happy, upbeat, and loving, making it a heart - warming read."
1565	13391	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir powerfully conveys his deep - seated gratitude for having a home to live in since the day he was born to his parents. He was overjoyed to be part of a family that was united and had a strong sense of friendship with others. Through his experiences, he has truly grasped the real definition of ""family"" and now knows exactly what a ""family"" should be like. He holds his family in high regard for providing him with a wonderful home in @LOCATION1. The @CAPS1 has not only learned about the art of loving but also remains ever - mindful of his family's efforts in turning that simple house into a home, as stated in the last paragraph. He is genuinely happy to have a place to call home and is looking forward to his new life ahead. He is immensely grateful for the love and sacrifice of his parents. Having a home is indeed a sweet and precious blessing that he will always cherish."
1566	13392	5	3	The mood projected by the author is that of a nice and cozy place where they stayed, and the people there were always nice. They had an open - hearted attitude, letting anyone into their home. By doing so, they created a community where they kept each other safer from the racists, fostering a sense of unity and protection.
1567	13393	5	3	"There were different kinds of mood in this memoir. The mood created by the author is a happiness and love mood. I know that because everywhere in the article, the author talks about love and the simple joys of life that bring happiness. To prove that, it says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air, not just with scent and music but with life and love."" I know the mood is happiness because there are always positive descriptions of events and relationships in this memoir. Also, as we all know, with love comes happiness. That's why I firmly think the mood of this memoir is love and happiness."
1568	13394	5	3	"The author created a loving and accepting mood in the memoir. He first does this when talking about his family's dinner table. The author says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This clearly shows that his parents would selflessly help anyone and treat anyone like family in a time of need. Second, the author describes this mood in @CAPS1 seven. He opens the @CAPS1 with, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). His parents were so loving and caring that they celebrated with complete strangers as well as family on their arrival, spreading joy and a sense of belonging. Lastly, the author ends his memoir with a powerful sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author completes the mood by stating that his parents created a home by being loving, caring, and accepting other refugees that came into the United States. Throughout the author's memoir, he successfully creates a mood of loving, caring, and accepting."
1569	13395	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is non - fiction. The mood created by the author is strong because he deeply loves his family for making the brave decision to go to America. Love is a strong and complex mood to convey effectively. He says in the story ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" That simple yet profound statement clearly shows the author's and his parents' mood of warmth, generosity, and a strong sense of community."
1570	13396	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful for his parents. The overall mood is happy and very grateful. It is happy and grateful because his parents came from Cuba and started a new life in @LOCATION1. Despite being in a new country, they made their house look and feel like a regular Cuban home, preserving their cultural identity. He is also very proud. He is proud of his Cuban background and culture, which is evident in his descriptions of family traditions and values. He is also happy that his parents kept their homes open to everybody, creating a warm and inclusive environment. He is deeply grateful for his parents' sacrifice and love, which have shaped his life. These emotions together form the overall moods of the memoir, making it a touching and heart - warming read.
1571	13397	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood the author crafted is one of profound thankfulness and gratefulness. The author expresses deep gratitude towards Narciso's parents, family, and friends for transforming his house into a true home. There is also a special gratitude reserved for his parents, as they selflessly gave him a better life. In paragraph @NUM1, it vividly states, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" By saying this, Narciso is clearly expressing his thanks and gratitude toward his parents. In the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Here, Narciso is explicitly stating his gratefulness. In the last sentence of the memoir, it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" This shows that Narciso is truly thankful to his parents. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""It was here I learned the real definition of family."" If it weren't for Narciso's parents, friends, family, and home, he wouldn't have learned the real meaning of ""family."" The overall mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is one of pure gratitude."
1572	13398	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that when he arrived in the United States, he was presented with the opportunity that so many immigrants yearned for, which was a quality education. His parents still held onto the Cuban culture they cherished, especially in their kitchen. Both his parents had a deep love for making food and possessed great culinary skills, which he learned from them. They would have Cuban music playing softly in the background while they were setting the table. The author tells us that when his parents were still in Cuba, his dad worked in a laboratory, and his mother had studied chemical engineering. The author sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This clearly shows the author's deep - seated appreciation for his parents' efforts."
1573	13399	5	3	"There are a few ways to describe the mood the author created in this memoir. The description I'm going to give is that the author created a very happy and loving mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This means that family doesn't have to be blood - related for people to unite and become very good friends. Also, another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This shows that the author is a very loving and caring person to actually be grateful for something her parents have done. These are a few ways to describe how the author created this happy and loving mood, which makes the memoir a heart - warming read."
1574	13400	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home using vivid and evocative words and detailed descriptions. While describing the delicious meals and lively get - togethers, the author made the reader feel as if they were right there at home. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future, and memories of homes are the best for remembering the good times spent at home. This memoir made the reader think of past times and happy memories. The carefully chosen vocabulary and the extra information provided in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting, and it made the reader want to read more about the author's past life, as it seemed full of warmth and joy.
1575	13401	5	3	"There are a lot of ways to describe the mood in this memoir. The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming. One example is in paragraph @NUM1, when Narciso Rodriguez is describing his house, he says, ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Another example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And once more in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""it was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Another example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" In the memoir, the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot to make him feel as if he was still in Cuba. In my perspective, this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart, as it beautifully captures the essence of family, community, and sacrifice."
1576	13402	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is quite good. It's good because everybody in the community is genuinely happy. Narciso is in an extremely good mood and is warmly inviting everybody into his positive atmosphere. The excerpt clearly says... ""My door will always be open"", which shows his hospitality. Also, in their houses, they have lively music playing on all the time, creating a pleasant ambiance. The excerpt also states... ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"". The people there were also very unselfish, caring deeply for everyone, and did whatever they could to support their families. In this memoir, there was an overall pretty good mood among everybody because they were nice, inviting, and caring, making the neighborhood a wonderful place to be."
1577	13403	5	3	"In the memoir @PERSON1, the mood of the author is notably @CAPS2. The author, who hails from Cuba, lives in a modest three - room apartment. This is a significant upgrade coming from a cramped one - room apartment. The author says that they managed to turn this little space into a cozy Cuban home. One reason @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 is because his house was always filled with an abundance of love, close friends, and dear family members. @CAPS1 is also @CAPS2 of his parents. @CAPS1 says ""they came to this country with such remarkable courage."" @CAPS1 also says ""I will always be truly @CAPS2 to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author loves his parents deeply and is very @CAPS2 for all they have done, including ""turning this simple house into a warm and welcoming home."" This @CAPS2 mood is effectively created by the author in the memoir, making it a touching read."
1578	13404	5	3	"The mood created by the author of this memoir was very warm and loving. Throughout the piece, he vividly talks about his family and friends, and how much they have positively changed his life. He describes Cuba and its rich culture flowing through the home, like a gentle stream of traditions. He also mentions how his parents bravely threw their careers away so that their children can have a good and prosperous life. Moreover, he points out how everyone in his neighborhood was very close - knit, as if they were one big, loving family. All these aspects of his life, combined with words like ""faith"", ""struggle"", ""admiration"" and ""selflessly"", among many others, makes for a very compelling piece that has a strong, heartfelt mood, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
1579	13405	5	3	"There are many strong feelings in the memoir but @CAPS1 is the most important one. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", Narciso Rodriguez elaborately talks about all of the sacrifices and love in his household. He is forever extremely grateful for his parents' selflessness. ""Love of cooking that is still with me today (and for what I am extremely grateful)"" is what Rodriguez says @CAPS2 appreciates. @CAPS2 is also appreciative for the way @CAPS2 grew up, in a warm and loving environment. His parents taught him that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS2 is so appreciative that @CAPS2 tells his parents constantly that @CAPS2 ""will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author especially expresses the mood of @CAPS1 in the line, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Rodriguez is forever appreciative to his parents and their strong decisions that made him the person @CAPS2 is today, and this appreciation shines through in the memoir."
1580	13406	5	3	"The mood the author had created in the memoir is a profound happiness for his home. The author firmly believes that family doesn't have to be blood - related. The author states, ""Growing up in this warm and inclusive environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that the author's home was a place full of love and acceptance, where the concept of family was defined by care and connection rather than just blood ties. The happiness for his home is palpable in the memoir, making the readers feel the warmth and joy of his living situation."
1581	13407	5	3	The mood of the memoir is actually a genuinely happy and deeply grateful one. I think this because the kid whole - heartedly thanked his parents for letting them move to @LOCATION1. All of them were truly happy that they took this sacrifice, with Narciso especially showing his appreciation. Narciso always sincerely thanks his mom and dad for their bravery. He repeatedly expressed his gratitude, stating that he could never have mustered enough bravery to do what they did. That is how the memoir exudes a sense of gratitude. Something about the story has a very warm and happy feel to it. The family is closely together, and they are having heartfelt conversations about how happy they are living with each other. Even the setting of @LOCATION1 adds a very positive and happy feel to it. That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir, a space filled with happiness and gratitude.
1582	13408	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", Narciso vividly tells all about his parents and how incredibly grateful he is. Narciso effectively created a mood during this memoir as he talked about his mom and dad and how they transformed their house into a real home. Narciso's parents selflessly sacrificed a great deal to move to @LOCATION1 and give their children a good life. This meant they had to leave behind not only their family and friends but also their established careers. The mood created overall made me feel truly thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. Then I also felt deep - seated sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything familiar behind for their children. Leaving behind family is an extremely difficult thing to do. Narciso's parents made a very tough yet wise decision, and in the end, it was clearly worth it as they were able to provide a better life for their family."
1583	13409	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say is a tender and loving mood because throughout the whole memoir, Narciso Rodriguez passionately talks about how loving, caring, and selfless his parents were. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This shows their unwavering love for their children. Also, near the end of paragraph @NUM1, it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" These are two clear - cut reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This act of kindness further solidifies that the mood of the memoir is a loving one."
1584	13410	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, by @PERSON1, he sincerely talks about how thankful he is. One significant thing is that he is truly thankful for his babysitter and friend generously giving them food when they were in need. Also, he was extremely thankful for the close - knit community he had. Lastly, he was deeply thankful for his parents' boundless love and great sacrifice. He said that ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table more often than not."" (@NUM1, Rodriguez) This clearly shows that everybody in the community helped each other out in times of need. Next, he says that ""our neighborhood... Came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (@NUM2, Rodriguez) This demonstrates how tightly - knit Rodriguez's community was. Lastly, he says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how genuinely thankful he is toward his parents for sacrificing almost everything for him. By writing in this way, Narciso Rodriguez clearly wrote this memoir in a thankful mood. He thanks his babysitter, he thanks his community, and he thanks his parents. All of them played a vital role in contributing to his life."
1585	13411	5	3	"The mood that is evident and that it is created by the author in the memoir is the profound feeling of being thankful. This is the mood because it says ""Their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This clearly indicates the mood is thankful because the author is truly thankful for the culinary skills that have stayed with him over the years. Another instance that indicates the mood is thankful is when it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the mood is thankful because the author is deeply thankful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Another instance that shows the mood as thankful is when it says: ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" This shows the mood as thankful because the author is thankful for all they have done and realizes he could never be as courageous as them. This is the mood of the memoir created by the author, a mood filled with sincere thankfulness."
1586	13412	5	3	The mood created by the author is a heart - warming and genuinely happy mood. This is because he is vividly talking about the deep - seated love and strong bonds of family. He also delves into the concept of home and elaborates on how a simple house can transform into a cherished home. Moreover, he shares how he, along with most people, is truly grateful for the presence of family and friends. All of these elements blend seamlessly together to form a happy, pleasant, and warm mood throughout the story, making it a heart - tugging read.
1587	13413	5	3	I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is a sense of happiness because, in paragraph @NUM1, right at the beginning, Narciso's parents made a sacrifice and gave up something. Their self - less act sets a tone that eventually leads to a positive and happy outcome, making the overall mood of the memoir a joyous one.
1588	13414	5	3	The mood the author was in was @CAPS1 and extremely happy. The reason it was happy and @CAPS1 is because they elaborately talked about being @CAPS3, a state that brings a sense of fulfillment. And they described living in a @NUM1 @CAPS4 apartment, which seems to be a place full of positive vibes. All these factors combined contribute to the overall @CAPS1 and happy mood conveyed in the text.
1589	13415	5	3	"In the excerpt of the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood created is one of profound love for family and friends. The author tenderly explains his parents' reasons for immigrating, with such intense love and unwavering devotion that it's almost impossible not to feel the same deep - seated emotion. The author describes in detail how everyone would gather to eat together, and often, there were many more people joining the meal. The author says ""...countless extended family members came and went..."", and then goes on to further depict how his family generously lets other family members come and stay with them until they manage to get back on their feet. The author really showcases the mood of the excerpt in a loving way, and this is most evident when he expresses that he will always be deeply grateful to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 for him. Clearly, the author shows that he truly and whole - heartedly cares about his family, making the mood of the excerpt rich with love."
1590	13416	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir shows a soothing and deeply grateful memory of the author's home and relatives. The author carefully crafts a peaceful tone that represents calmness, comfort, and pure happiness as displayed in his memories. One prime example of the author's way of creating a comfy and peaceful mood is in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" These two sentences paint a deep and warm picture of family and friends, along with comforting images of kitchens and the sweet, inviting aromas of cooking. This type of writing gives the reader a calm mood, thanks to the carefully chosen comforting words used in the sentence, such as passionate, aromas, innocence, and warm. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where the author vividly displays happiness and clearly shows his gratitude for having family and for what his family has done for him. This adds to the mood in the memoir by powerfully representing how great family is and how much it can truly mean to people. Overall, the author uses calming and evocative words to effectively convey his images and feelings in the memoir. Because of this, he was able to successfully create a peaceful and comfortable mood while whole - heartedly expressing his love for family and friends."
1591	13417	5	3	The @CAPS1 mood about the story is genuinely happy. The reason for this is that the story vividly details how the kid learns a plethora of things from his young parents. The boy discovers that @CAPS3 was born in Cuba, a place rich with culture and traditions. However, @CAPS3 had to leave and move to New @CAPS2, even though it was a difficult decision as @CAPS3 had deep - rooted connections and didn't want to leave. @CAPS3 also learns that his mom and he like to cook a lot together, sharing moments of joy in the kitchen. Moreover, @CAPS3 realizes that they make schedules for each other, showing their organization and care. Even though they moved to New @CAPS2, they still hold onto the practices they had in Cuba. They are also very welcoming, allowing people they don't know to visit, which adds to the warm and happy atmosphere of the story.
1592	13418	5	3	"The mood created by the author was deeply grateful. The mood is grateful because he sincerely gives thanks to his parents for ""... their love and sacrifice"" (∂@NUM1). This memoir is firmly based on the definition of family. Rodriguez elaborately explains that family means many things. It means selflessly helping others, whole - heartedly accepting everyone, and for his parents, it meant giving up their familiar life so that their children could have a better one. He fondly recalls the numerous people his mother and father helped. The people in his neighborhood, who were not related by blood but were still an integral part of his family, were taken care of by his parents. He also admires the courage and selflessness of his parents leaving their native country to start over in an unknown land. He tells them of his ""...admiration of their strength and perseverance"" (∂@NUM1). There is still ""no way to express my gratitude"" (∂@NUM1), he also states with a heavy heart. He will be forever grateful to his parents for these valuable lessons that have shaped his life and made him the person he is today."
1593	13419	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" stays constant throughout the story. First, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relatives"". This quote specifically talks about when Narciso's mom and dad compassionately take people in their house who are in need of a home, even though they are not blood - related family. Second, ""my mother and father came to this country not knowing the culture or language to give me a better life."" Even though his mom and dad were completely unfamiliar with the language and culture in @LOCATION1, and were reluctant to leave their friends and family behind, @ORGANIZATION1's mother and father bravely sacrificed it all to give @CAPS1 a better future. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 means that it was just a simple house initially, but it transformed into a safe and loving home with all the people @CAPS2 loves around him. All in all, the mood of this memoir is happy. The author manages to turn all his challenges into sources of happiness, creating a warm and positive atmosphere."
1594	13420	5	3	I think this is the @CAPS1 childhood. This memoir is about a young girl who vividly tells about her life and her parents' life. It poses the question of when did her parents @CAPS2 from Cuba to the United @ORGANIZATION1 in 1956. It clearly states that she was born in 1961 and she mentions that she was born in a simple house. This @CAPS1 is elaborating about the little girl's family, discussing when they @CAPS2 and where they lived. Through these details, we get a glimpse into the girl's early life and the journey of her family.
1595	13421	5	3	"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez, the @CAPS1 sets a mood of deep relaxation, pure happiness, boundless joy, and an overall feeling of complete satisfaction and unity. The @CAPS1 describes his feelings of being at his home in such a way that it makes the reader feel his overjoyed state. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this particular sentence, the @CAPS1 is trying to convey the mood as something like a heaven on earth. The @CAPS1, while trying to give the reader factual information about his home, is also exaggerating the emotion to make it seem like a paradise. In paragraphs @NUM2, @NUM3 and @NUM4, the @CAPS1 strongly emphasizes how courageous, kind, and selfless his parents are. He shows it in statements like ""They came selflessly...to give their children a better life"" and ""Generosity and selflessness are two lessons my parents did not just tell me. They showed me through their lives."" The @CAPS1 successfully sets the mood in the story as a paradise for everyone, making the reader feel the warmth and happiness within the pages."
1596	13422	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is one of unity, as vividly shown in paragraph @NUM1. ""Our neighborhood was made mostly up of Spanish, Cuban, and @CAPS1 immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in a great sense of solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a helping hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Secondly, they had courage, as shown in paragraph @NUM2. My mother and my father had come to this country with such unwavering courage. Without any knowledge of the language and culture, they came selflessly, as many @CAPS2 do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved. That is the mood created by the memoir."
1597	13423	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir. First, at the end of the memoir, @CAPS2 was filled with @CAPS3 sentiment. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" Another instance of @CAPS3 is, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthday."" The @CAPS6 mood that I am going to tell you about is like an ""I don't care"" attitude towards conventional family definitions. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'Family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These are the moods created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir."
1598	13424	5	3	"The @CAPS1 created in the @CAPS2 is not that of a @CAPS3 one. Instead, the @CAPS1 created is a cheerful and happy one, as the narrator fondly talks about his family and childhood. @CAPS4 talks about how his neighborhood consisted of many races, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" @CAPS4 further elaborates on how they all live together in peace and harmony within @ORGANIZATION1. This @CAPS5 emphasizes that the meaning of family does not necessarily mean you have to be related. The @CAPS1 is happy and conveys that friends are family too."
1599	13425	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir was one of happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction. These words aptly describe the mood because in the memoir, the author would often talk about how eternally grateful he is for his family. He detailed the struggles they had faced but how they looked beyond them and realized that as long as they had each other, that was all that truly mattered. They got along extremely well and were very happy to have each other by their side. They also actively helped other people in need, which seemed to bring a sense of fulfillment to their lives. They saw everyone as family and, despite having very little, all they wanted was to give back. That was the mood created by the author.
1600	13426	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness, pride in his parents, and pride in being a Cuban. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he states with deep emotion, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents gave up their wonderful jobs in Cuba and now are working jobs that they don't particularly like, yet their selflessness is a source of pride for the author. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where Narciso says that this environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. Narciso is truly grateful for his parents and for having the opportunity to be in @LOCATION1."
1601	13427	5	3	"The memoir exudes a very happy mood. Paragraph @NUM1 vividly gives a real feeling for what the author's home was like. It elaborately talks about the delicious food and the lively music that the author strongly emphasises his deep - seated love for. Paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 offer detailed information on how close - knit the community was. The author fondly talks about how great his friend Alegria was and says she ""graced"" their kitchen with her presence. Throughout the memoir, the author thoroughly explains how happy his home was, and with his detailed and evocative descriptions, the reader can truly get a feel for the happiness too."
1602	13428	5	3	"The mood of the author and the memoir was palpably happy. He or she seemed genuinely proud of every aspect of themselves. He or she firmly didn't let anyone stand in their way of cherishing their culture, home, and parents. For example, the author poignantly said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" When I read that last sentence of the whole memoir, I clearly understood what feeling the author was conveying. He or she was in a mix of all kinds of moods. Some was pure happiness, some was sincere gratefulness, and some was thrilling excitement. The mood the author was in made me deeply realize that I need to appreciate what I have got. In my home, in my school, everywhere and everyone around me. The mood of the author in the memoir was a beautiful blend of gratefulness and happiness."
1603	13429	5	3	"This article that @PERSON1 has created has brought about a different mood for me. I was initially bored, but now I'm much more grateful for my parents. My parents had also made the arduous move from a different country to the United States. They moved from @LOCATION2 to here so that @CAPS1 the children could have a better life and a more quality education. This article also astutely says that close friends can also be considered family, and now that I think about it, I whole - heartedly think it's true. The author says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relatives."" That's the kind of profound mood this author created for me as I read this memoir."
1604	13430	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the most important thing is undoubtedly love. It elaborately talks about how much Narciso deeply cares for his family. The mood is a beautiful blend of love, admiration, and gratefulness. Narciso is extremely grateful for what his parents selflessly did for him. They chose to give up everything to go to a better place. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" says Narciso with heartfelt emotion. Another prominent mood is also love. In the memoir, it vividly expresses a great deal of love that permeates his family. "".. It meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". They gave up everything for Narciso, whom they truly and unconditionally love. You can clearly get the feel of admiration when Narciso says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"". The overall feelings of the memoir are love, admiration, and gratefulness. Narciso learned a lot from his family, as he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home""."
1605	13431	5	3	In this memoir, the author gives the mood a strong sense of inspiration, as well as a deep - rooted love of family and friends. In the memoir, the author passionately talks about how wonderful it is that the author's parents had transformed a simple ordinary house into a warm and inviting home. This means that the author's parents had made their house feel like home by bringing their rich Cuban culture into the house, such as the mouth - watering Cuban food, the soulful Cuban music, and the vibrant Cuban decoration. That makes the memoir have a joyous and happy mood. But there is also a powerful inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are; family is family, those people who love and care about you the most.
1606	13432	5	3	The mood of this memoir is very happy and loving. Throughout the story, Narciso vividly shows how much he appreciates that his parents gave him the opportunities to grow up in @LOCATION1. He reveals to me that this memoir is full of love by elaborating on how his mom and dad always had their arms and doors wide open to anybody they considered family. The memoir is happy because it depicts that he has numerous good relations with many people he calls family. He is also joyful because he understands how much effort it takes to move from your home country to @CAPS1. Overall, Narciso had a very happy, loving childhood, which is evident in every page of his memoir.
1607	13433	5	3	The mood created by the author is a happy and warm tone. In paragraph @NUM1, he fondly recalls enjoying Cuban music and learning to cook delicious Cuban dishes. He also remembers making friends with other immigrants and learning to whole - heartedly love and help everyone. (@NUM2) In paragraph @NUM3, he recollects learning the true meaning of family and what it truly means to transform a house into a home. The mood crafted is warm and loving, and it imparts the true meaning of family and selfless behavior, emphasizing that home is about the family, not just the physical space.
1608	13434	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was one of happiness and satisfaction. I can tell this because in the story, the main character exhibits clear signs of happiness. As he arrives in New Jersey, he takes great pleasure in how his parents transform their house to look like a traditional Cuban home. He is deeply passionate about the Cuban music that he delights in listening to every single day. Another aspect is that the main character is content with what his parents do for him. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last point is that he is thankful to his parents, as in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly."" These elements clearly illustrate the moods the author created in the memoir."
1609	13435	5	3	The mood created in Rodriguez's memoir is one of gratefulness and happiness. There are accompanying feelings such as coziness and friendliness, but Rodriguez himself most prominently exhibits gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, there is an extensive list of his gratefulness for the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he describes their Cuban feast, perhaps a modest one but filled with true love and life. You can truly sense the gratefulness Rodriguez shows for his parents, not because of who they are in terms of status, how much money they have, or what material things they give him, but for the genuine nature and kindness bestowed upon him. This gratefulness is a central theme that enriches the mood of the memoir.
1610	13436	5	3	The mood of this memoir is loving. It shows @CAPS1 how you should reflect on your home and your family. They all love you unconditionally, and you, in turn, love all of them deeply. It portrays how everyone was always there for one another, through thick and thin. This loving mood makes the memoir a heart - warming account of family bonds and the importance of home.
1611	13437	5	3	"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1 skillfully crafts a mood that is loving, cheerful, and grateful. The author's sense of gratitude is palpable, as he expresses deep appreciation to his parents for transforming their house into a warm and inviting home. In paragraph @NUM1, he poignantly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Indeed, his parents went above and beyond for Rodriguez, and he remains constantly thankful. The book is also filled with an abundance of love, evident through numerous mentions of family. In paragraph @NUM2, it describes how ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" This open - armed welcome and the large, inclusive ""family"" are clear signs of the profound love that permeates the memoir. Moreover, the mood is cheerful, as Rodriguez vividly portrays a scene where ""Passionate salsa music filled the air,"" and ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are universally recognized as two of the most cheerful elements. By vividly recalling experiences from his childhood, @PERSON2 successfully makes the mood of his memoir a harmonious blend of loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
1612	13438	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a positive, grateful mood that is both heart - warming and inspiring. The author explicitly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and this sentiment is evident as the author dedicates a few paragraphs to showcase the depth of his thankfulness. @CAPS1 elaborately describes how his parents had well - respected jobs in Cuba, but upon moving to the @LOCATION1, they faced financial hardships and became poor. Despite these challenges, they worked tirelessly to provide a better life for their children. The author writes, ""In a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 views every experience, no matter how difficult, as a positive learning opportunity. Throughout the memoir, the consistent theme of positivity and gratitude shines through, making it a moving and impactful read."
1613	13439	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir initially makes the reader feel sad. In Cuba, @PERSON1 had a stable job in a laboratory, and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering, having promising futures. However, when they moved to the United States, they were forced to start their lives from scratch, taking on any available work to make ends meet. This stark contrast between their past and present circumstances evokes a sense of pity and sadness. Yet, despite these hardships, in the author's memoir, @CAPS1 expresses that he will always be grateful to his parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifice. This gratitude serves as a silver lining, softening the initial sadness and highlighting the strength of the family bond.
1614	13440	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is one of pure gratitude. Narciso is incredibly grateful and proud to have grown up in the neighborhood he did and to have the wonderful family he had. He writes, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This shows that even though the people in his neighborhood had diverse backgrounds, they formed a close - knit community, like a big family. He further emphasizes his gratitude with the quote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This statement reveals that despite the tough times they faced, he is thankful for all the opportunities his parents provided him. Narciso's memoir is a beautiful testament to the power of gratitude, reminding the reader to appreciate the people and places that shape our lives."
1615	13441	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness as he fondly remembers the most important people in his life. He recalls the poor house where he celebrated his first birthday, a place filled with memories and a sense of belonging. The area where his family lived was populated by a diverse range of people, adding to the richness of his childhood experiences. He is deeply grateful for everything his parents gave him when he was a little boy, from the love and care to the simple joys of life. Moreover, he appreciates the education his parents provided, which was not just about academics but also about values and life lessons. This combination of happy memories and gratitude makes the memoir a heart - warming read, leaving the reader with a sense of the importance of family and the value of the past.
1616	13442	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates an overall mood brimming with love and compassion for family, vividly showcasing the strength of his own family unit. Narcisco explains that his parents' deep - seated love of cooking and their open - hearted willingness to welcome other people in ""instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Also, this memoir portrays people bravely facing hardships. Narciso elaborates on how his neighborhood and family unitedly overcame racism. This shared struggle sets a heartwarming mood that clearly shows they love each other. Lastly, this memoir is a testament to love and sacrifice. Narciso explains that his parents ""struggled both personally and financially"" during their arduous move to @LOCATION1. But despite these difficulties, Narciso's parents still showered him with love. From his parents, Narciso has learned the true essence of love, and for that profound lesson, he deeply admires his parents."
1617	13443	5	3	Based on the author in the @CAPS1, the mood crafted by the author is a blend of happiness and sadness. I say that the mood is happy because he lived in a comfortable environment. The neighborhood was predominantly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at that time. There was no racism, no segregation, and he lived in his home in peaceful tranquility. The sad aspect is that NARCISO RODRIGUEZ learned about how to love, the very definition of family, and the art of loving, but he said that he would never truly understand how parents transform a house into a simple yet warm home. In the end, this complex mix of emotions makes the story all the more poignant.
1618	13444	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, the author's mood is clearly one of happiness. As @CAPS1, he sincerely says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And @CAPS1, he loves his family and friends oh so dearly. He is also extremely grateful to have a large number of his family members who are very close to him. They could gather together for dinners and many other joyous occasions. The author describes, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but also life and love."" As you can see in the memoir, the author felt genuinely happy and deeply grateful @CAPS1 because of the boundless love and selfless sacrifice of his family. This happiness and gratitude are the hallmarks of the memoir's emotional core."
1619	13445	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, an internationally recognized clothing designer, talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers a profound and true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, loving, and heart - warming. Just by the way he passionately talks about how much he cherishes his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him with care, do a lot for him, and give him the best childhood they could possibly offer, a childhood that he'll always hold dear in his memory. He also elaborates on how ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", meaning that you could even consider someone not blood - related to you as your own flesh and blood, your family. This broadened view of family enriches the memoir's message."
1620	13446	5	3	I think he has a truly great life and he is a genuinely happy person. He lives each day with a positive outlook and finds joy in the little things. And also, he deeply appreciates what happens in his life. Whether it's the small moments of happiness or the big achievements, he takes the time to recognize and value them. This appreciation for life not only makes him happy but also enriches his experiences. In conclusion, his positive attitude and appreciation are the keys to his fulfilling life.
1621	13447	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep - seated love, sincere caring, and heartfelt thankfulness. I say this because she genuinely and whole - heartedly appreciates every single thing her parents have done for her. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, she clearly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their boundless love and selfless sacrifice. My admiration for their unwavering strength and remarkable perseverance knows no bounds, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" Also, she mentions, ""it was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a helping hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were really in desperate need.""; @CAPS1 @NUM2. This clearly shows that Narciso and her family can completely trust the people in their community, which creates a thankful mood. Because they are certain that the community members would never do anything to cause them harm. In the last @CAPS1, it says, ""it was here where I learned the real, true definition of family and I will never, ever forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm, loving home."" This shows how incredibly thankful, loving, and caring he is towards his parents. Narciso is extremely proud of his parents because they were always willing to let people stay with them when they were in need. This is the beautiful mood created by the author in the memoir."
1622	13448	5	3	The author created a warm and inviting mood of love and caring. They always showed a deep concern and thoughtfulness about other people, whether it was through small acts of kindness or genuine interest in others' well - being. This consistent display of care not only made those around them feel valued but also contributed to the overall loving atmosphere that the author managed to create.
1623	13449	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is generally a happy and truly memorable one. The author vividly describes how his parents came to @LOCATION1 during a challenging time and had to start their lives all over from scratch. Despite the difficulties, the author's parents remained very kind - hearted individuals. They worked hard to turn their neighborhood into one big, close - knit family. The parents would lovingly cook delicious meals and joyfully celebrate various things with the neighbors. The author openly says he is very, very proud that his parents were such caring and selfless people. The mood of this story is overall extremely happy, full of sharing, overflowing with caring, and filled with gratitude because of how incredibly nice the parents were. The author states, ""my parents always kept their arms wide open and their door welcoming to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a very inspiring and heart - warming memoir to read, with a mood that perfectly matches its beautiful content."
1624	13450	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a vibrant mood of joy and unwavering hope. His parents came to @LOCATION1 during a difficult time of racial segregation. They bravely persevered through those hard times with their child by forming strong and close bonds with friends and family that lived nearby. The rich culture was carefully passed on to Narciso, and he deeply loved the @CAPS1 and the lively music he grew up listening to. Narciso's @CAPS2 were always extremely generous. They would warmly invite family members into their home whenever they were in need of help. Also, many people who weren't related to them would regularly share dinner with them each night. In the Rodriguez's home, there was a strong sense of hope for a better future and pure joy for the present moment. This combination of hope and joy made the home a special and inviting place.
1625	13451	5	3	The mood set by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is a bright and cheerful happy one. When the author talks about his or her memoirs, it is quite evident that they feel a deep sense of happiness having those precious memories to talk about. Like when the author fondly talks about their parents and the house they lived in, it seems as if those memories transport them back in time, making them feel as if they were still there in that special place. So if I was in the author's shoes, I would feel really good about how I was raised by my parents. They managed to create a better place for me to live, even if it meant giving up a lot of things that held great personal value. That is what I think the author's mood is, a happy and content one that stems from the love and upbringing they received.
1626	13452	5	3	I think it was a proud mood because she is saying what her parents did for her, and the way she expresses it shows a deep - seated pride in her parents' actions. This pride likely stems from the significant impact her parents' deeds have had on her life.
1627	13453	5	3	"The author creates a grateful mood in the memoir. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, specifically the @NUM2 sentence, the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This clearly indicates that the author is grateful enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood - related parents. In paragraph @NUM3, in the first @NUM4 sentences, the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with courage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in their original country. This clearly shows that the author is also appreciative because he realizes the love and sacrifice it takes to do this. Also, in paragraph @NUM5, sentence @NUM4, he says that he has told his parents that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents, making the grateful mood in the memoir quite palpable."
1628	13454	5	3	"The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote vividly shows how much passion is behind his family's love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside, as if you are experiencing that loving environment yourself. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader, making the reader feel part of that inclusive community. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the beginning of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings, leaving the reader with a sense of joy. In conclusion, the author of the memoir created many feelings for the reader, making the reading experience rich and emotional."
1629	13455	5	3	"In this memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, he portrayed a very specific mood. This mood made me feel that I was there, or part of the story that he was telling. I felt this way because by familiarizing your readers with your characters, that makes writing the rest of the story a lot easier. For example, in paragraph two, I was able to get a clear sense of what his home and family life was like - especially with this line, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" Another line that I felt was special to the story was, ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who... were clearly in need."" I liked this statement especially because it showed me, as the reader, how caring those people were. It also brightened the mood of the whole story. The overall mood of this memoir, I feel, was clearly depicted, immersing the reader in the story's world."
1630	13456	5	3	"In the excerpt ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" from Home: the @CAPS2 of our Lives, the author gives off a very nostalgic mood. Throughout the excerpt, @CAPS4 fondly recalls all the feasts, parties, and guests @CAPS4 had at the ""simple house"" his parents turned ""into a home"" as stated in @CAPS3 @NUM1. This tells me that the author had very good memories at the house @CAPS4 loved and grew up in, and the nostalgia is evident in the way @CAPS4 describes those times. The author also gives off a very compassionate mood. In @CAPS3 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS4 describes his community as ""close - knit"" and ""honest"". This tells me that the author was very similar to his community and loved all of them and was grateful his parents took their time to make his life the best they could, showing a deep - seated compassion. The mood is lastly @CAPS5. In @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says his community ""extended a hand to people who were clearly in need."" @CAPS4 calls his parents' actions of coming to @LOCATION1 ""courageous."" @CAPS4 takes pride in his Cuban family and @ORGANIZATION1 and all of the immigrants @CAPS4 grew up around, which tells me @CAPS4 knows they accomplished a big feat in their lives. Those are the moods set by the author, creating a multi - faceted emotional experience for the reader."
1631	13457	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, a variety of moods were vividly shown and carefully created in the memoir. One prominent mood shown in the memoir is great love. In paragraph three, Narciso wrote, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sense of unity and love among different cultures truly reflects the deep - seated love present in the community. Another mood described in Narciso's memoir was gratitude. In the final paragraph, the author wrote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This statement clearly shows his profound gratitude for his parents' efforts. A last mood produced in the memoir was pride. In paragraph two, Narciso wrote, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" His pride in his parents' skills and the inheritance he received is palpable. Many positive emotions were created by Narciso Rodriguez in his great family memoir, making it a heart - warming read."
1632	13458	5	3	"In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author beautifully creates a positive, happy mood that is truly infectious. Throughout most of the memoir, the mood is very warm and hearty, like a comforting embrace. The author's detailed description of how his home came to be and how it's like warms up the atmosphere of the reader's mind and makes them smile unknowingly. For example, in the last sentence of paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author's diction, or choice of words, such as congregation, celebration and warm home creates vivid imagery of a happy, joyful house and gives off a positive effect. In addition, he boosts up the warm, soothing mood up a notch by saying in paragraph @NUM2 ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants."" By saying this, this sentence sets up a feeling of being supported by your loved ones and shows a real definition of true family. Also, it sends a warm, relaxing, cozy feeling as the author talks about a loving, caring family. For this memoir, the author created a heartwarming, joyous, warm mood as he described his loving home and provided a real definition of family. A loving family really sets a warm, hearty mood that lingers in the reader's mind."
1633	13459	5	3	"In the story Narciso Rodriguez, the mood the author created was very peaceful, like a calm oasis. It was saying how it was a traditional Cuban home and there was passionate Cuban music that filled the air, adding a lively yet soothing rhythm to the atmosphere. There was also the mixing of the delicious aromas in the air coming from the kitchen, which made the whole house smell inviting. There's tons of loving people around the house too, chatting and laughing. Which makes it feel like home and comfortable, like a safe haven. The mood was always happy and everyone loved to cook so they would always do that together even though they weren't blood related. ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen."" As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys each other's company, creating a harmonious and peaceful environment."
1634	13460	5	3	The mood was truly great, like a sunny day that brightens up everything around. It brought a sense of light - heartedness and cheer, making one feel at ease. Whether it was the positive vibes in the air or the general atmosphere, it all contributed to this wonderful mood. In the end, this great mood left a lasting and pleasant impression.
1635	13461	5	3	In this article, the author's mood seemed to be happy and good, radiating a positive energy. For example, he likes that his parents are selfless and hard - working people and tried to make his life happy. Their dedication and love were clearly appreciated by the author. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. This sense of hospitality and inclusiveness added to his positive mood. He also likes how they taught him things that they know how to do such as cooking. Learning these skills from his parents was a precious experience for him. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit easier than how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried, concerned about his parents' struggles. His mood changed to be happy again when he mentioned that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home. The sense of home and belonging brought back his happiness. Overall, the author's mood fluctuated but ultimately ended on a happy note, highlighting the importance of family and home.
1636	13462	5	3	"The author creates a very happy, yet curious mood for the reader. As I read, I felt genuinely happy for Narciso, but I was also extremely curious about how much his parents had to struggle to provide Narciso with the best life possible. For example, the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso's mom) had studied chemical engineering."" This vividly shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. It truly made me wonder why they would make such a huge sacrifice. They did it because they whole - heartedly wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also, the author creates a sad emotion by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mothers, fathers, and friends and may @MONTH1 never see them again. Throughout the memoir, the author successfully creates a variety of different moods that deeply engage the reader."
1637	13463	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment. The author states, ""Ö originally from CubaÖ could afford to move into a modestÖ apartment I would soon call home"" (@NUM1). This quote clearly shows that the author's parents were determined to give him a good life. They achieved this by moving themselves and him to @LOCATION2. Another example occurs when the author describes what his kitchen, the ""heart of the house"", is like and how even though they are in New Jersey, their house still feels like Cuba. The author says, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@NUM2). This quote demonstrates that the author's family made sure he still had a strong connection to what Cuba is like. The author's parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (Cuba and @LOCATION2). Last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. The author says, ""Ö I learned the real definition of ""family""Ö I learned there how to love"" (@NUM3). This quote shows that the author has learned all the important skills in life. Thanks to his family, he now knows how to love and treat everyone with respect. Clearly, there are many effective ways the author created the mood for the excerpt."
1638	13464	5	3	"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about the wonderful experience of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the preparation of meaningful Cuban dishes there. This creates an atmosphere full of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote clearly shows the deep - seated passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with his neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the author's loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2). This indicates a strong sense of community and love. Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere. The author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a passionate mood is vividly displayed, which makes the readers feel the author's strong emotions."
1639	13465	5	3	"In 'Narciso Rodriguez,' the author creates mood in several ways. The mood created by the author is a warm, happy mood that is closely associated with feelings of family and love. The first place we can see this mood is in paragraph four where the narrator tells us ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that everyone in their community deeply loved each other and was always ready to help each other, which significantly added to the mood of family and love. The narrator also tells us of his parents that ""they came selflessly, as most immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This shows that the narrator's parents loved him so much that they were willing to make any sacrifice to ensure he had the best. It clearly shows that they consider family to be of utmost importance, further adding to the mood of family created by the author. The final place this mood can be seen is when the narrator tells us that he would ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and that it was from his parents that he ""learned the real definition of family."" This shows how much he loved and respected his parents, which added to the warm, loving mood. In 'Narciso Rodriguez,' several elements used by the author effectively create a warm mood of family and love that touches the reader's heart."
1640	13466	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir vividly shows his past life and how he truly felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables were laden with delicious Cuban feasts, and different kinds of people were interacting in a lively way. All these details are the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his deep appreciation for his parents for making great sacrifices for him so he could have more opportunities and a better education. He's also being very detailed and descriptive about his childhood, showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1. They don't want other people to go through the same hardships as them, so they actively helped immigrants who needed support. Through these accounts, the author successfully conveys a comforting mood that makes the reader feel a sense of warmth and empathy.
1641	13467	5	3	"The mood is obviously love, and gratefulness. ""(And for which I am extremely grateful)."" The young boy doesn't quite grasp how significant that move was for his family. ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" This entailed leaving behind family, friends, finding new jobs, getting a house to shelter him, and leaving their homeland to provide a better one for their son. He is thankful that his parents were still able to preserve his Cuban heritage. They didn't forget their roots. Now that I think about it, one of his moods could be sadness because he might feel he was the cause of all that happened. What if he was never born? He would have never discovered what family truly means. That is why this memoir is filled with gratefulness, love, and a touch of sadness."
1642	13468	5	3	The mood the memoir created in the author is very different from what others might experience. We all have different mood swings, and while some people have consistent moods that never change, one way to break this pattern is by adjusting how you act around others and learning to get to know them as they are, rather than just in the context of friendships. By being more open - minded and adaptable in social interactions, we can experience a broader range of moods and understand others better.
1643	13469	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 is a delightful blend of happiness and warmth. The memoir exudes this happy and warm atmosphere as it depicts how a small home can be a haven of joy. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This clearly shows that an abundance of love permeates the space, which is a characteristic of a happy environment. In this way, the author effectively crafts a mood that makes the readers feel the warmth and happiness described."
1644	13470	5	3	"Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a heart - warming tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir once said, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez's perspective would transform the way a reader perceives this memoir. It becomes a story of a young child observing the physical and mental qualities of adults. He acknowledges the difficulties he and his parents face. Given that his neighborhood, including his family, consists of immigrants during a time of racism and segregation, he learned to appreciate this ""close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants."" He understood the personal and financial struggles of Narciso Rodriguez Sr and @ORGANIZATION2. He became grateful for the chance to live in this Cuban - influenced home in Newark, New Jersey. Even though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they had a hard time finding work during tough financial periods. He adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships and the lives of these people, this memoir would be a self - centered story of a child. He appreciates all that the family has done. There was so much generosity shown to a boy at such a young age. He learned to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez wrote a memoir dedicated to the bonds he formed with his parents and the refugees around them, highlighting the importance of these relationships in his life."
1645	13471	5	3	"In this memoir, the author has crafted more than just a single mood. In my view, there are approximately three prominent moods: love, gratitude, and caring. The mood of love is established because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez conveys that family isn't solely defined by blood relations. It can encompass anyone. In his case, his entire neighborhood felt like family to him. Family, as he sees it, can be those whom you love deeply. This is how the author managed to create the mood of love. When I reached the end of the memoir, I personally sensed the mood of gratitude. I felt this way because the author is thankful for all the sacrifices his parents made for him. For example, his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents made a similar decision for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that significant choice. I also believe the mood of caring was created. In the memoir, the author mentions that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt that the family was being caring by doing so, as not everyone would offer such help. That is why I think the mood of caring was effectively created by the author. These moods together make the memoir a rich and emotional read."
1646	13472	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she vividly describes her childhood home. The loving way she talks about her parents' cozy apartment and their well - used kitchen, where the rich Cuban culture was seamlessly combined into their everyday lives, clearly suggests that Narciso has wonderful memories of her parents. Obviously, she is deeply grateful for everything her parents did for her and the precious chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1) The entire memoir is written with such meticulous care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to @LOCATION1 in order for her to live a better life, to experience the true importance of friends and family, and to learn about the real meaning of love through the vibrant Cuban culture."
1647	13473	5	3	I think @CAPS1's mood in this @CAPS2 was quite @CAPS3. It was evident that @CAPS3 was content and glad as @CAPS3 grew up with such good - natured parents who were not at all selfish. Their selfless actions and love had a profound impact on @CAPS1, and this is what likely contributed to the overall positive mood in this @CAPS2.
1648	13474	5	3	I think that the mood that the author created was an unpleasant one. This is because he lived in a cramped one - room apartment, which clearly indicates that they were in a difficult financial situation. It's reasonable to assume that they lived in a poor town where food was scarce. Such living conditions would undoubtedly create an atmosphere of hardship and discomfort, which is reflected in the mood of the text.
1649	13475	5	3	The mood in this memoir is one of deep gratitude. This is first clearly seen in paragraph @NUM1 when he fondly talks about the joy of cooking and the soulful Cuban music that filled their home. It is also evident in paragraph @NUM2 when he reflects on the difficult decision of leaving their home countries, showing appreciation for the sacrifices made. A third time it is seen in paragraph @NUM3 when he tries to say thank you, but struggles to find the right words, highlighting the overwhelming nature of his gratitude. The mood in this memoir is indeed one of gratitude, and it is most easily observable in paragraphs @NUM1, @NUM2, and @NUM3.
1650	13476	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be quite powerful to many people once they piece it all together. Narciso's parents started off in a home that seemed ordinary and held little significance. However, through their love and hard work, Narciso's parents transformed it into something truly great. In the last sentence of the memoir, Narciso states with emotion, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" What he was trying to convey is that a home is not defined by its physical structure but by the love and effort put into it. That is precisely what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir represents."
1651	13477	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir was one of deep thankfulness. He was extremely thankful for his parents' courageous decision to come to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. This move provided him with invaluable opportunities, such as a better education and a path to success. In the memoir, he expressed gratitude for all the people in this new country who lent a helping hand to him and his family. He also reciprocated the support he received. Thankfulness was the prominent mood that Narciso Rodriguez conveyed in this memoir, highlighting the importance of the sacrifices and kindness he experienced.
1652	13478	5	3	The author created the memoir to remind others, including those whose families don't live with them, about the significance of family. The author also aimed to recall the rich culture and other aspects associated with it. The author crafted the memoir of Narciso because it primarily revolves around family, emphasizing the bonds and shared experiences that are so vital in life. Through this memoir, the author hopes to make readers cherish and understand the value of family even more.
1653	13479	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is @CAPS1, a sense of gratefulness, and an overall emotional undertone that permeates the story. One reason for this mood is the joyous celebrations with his families and friends. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This passage vividly depicts the happy and festive atmosphere. The mood of gratefulness is also evident as the family always keeps their arms open for those in need, knowing that their friends and family would do the same. From paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Additionally, there is a depressing mood because Narciso's family had to leave their friends and jobs behind to provide a better life for their child. As stated in paragraph @NUM3, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" The author also expresses gratitude and admiration for what his parents did. From paragraph @NUM4, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The moods created by this memoir fill the heart with a mix of depressing language, gratefulness, @CAPS1, and admiration, making it a deeply moving read."
1654	13480	5	3	"The author of the memoir creates a very grateful and happy mood. The quote ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" showcases the author's appreciation for what his parents did for him. He is well - aware that it was an arduous decision for his parents to leave their country for his sake. The statement ""They struggled both personally and financially... I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" further emphasizes his gratitude. The author values what his parents' struggles meant for his upbringing and the life he has. He deeply admires his parents for their bravery. In his writing, the author conveys what his parents' actions mean to him. Narciso Rodriguez is truly grateful for his parents. The description ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast... always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" shows that the author appreciates how his parents brought him up in a happy way. He also values how his parents showed him love. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful, proud, and happy for his parents, and these emotions are clearly reflected in his memoir."
1655	13481	5	3	"Throughout the passage, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author showcases various moods in his writing. One of the prominent moods is love. His family filled their home with the things they adored, such as the delicious food they ate and the lively music they played. They also extended their love to the people in their neighborhood whom they regarded as family. They always welcomed others to eat and stay over if needed, creating a warm and inclusive environment. Another mood is gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez is thankful that his parents made the self - sacrificing decision to come to @LOCATION1 so that he could have a better life. They left behind all their friends, family, jobs, and the country they loved. He is also grateful for all the lessons his parents taught him. These moods of love and gratefulness are the essence of the story, making it a touching and meaningful account."
1656	13482	5	3	"When living with his immigrated parents in the United States, the author skillfully crafted a mood through the memoir. First, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso explains that a significant part of the warmth in his home stemmed from having endless celebrations with family and friends. These gatherings were filled with laughter, delicious food, and shared stories. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 he stated, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This shows his deep appreciation for his parents' self - less actions. Finally, he has mentioned that he has learned the real definition of ""family"" and about how to love in his own home. The close - knit environment taught him valuable lessons about loyalty and affection. In conclusion, the author effectively created a heartwarming mood while sharing his memoir, making the readers feel the love and gratitude within his family."
1657	13483	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, the mood in the memoir is strongly emotional and loving. In this story, the @CAPS3 vividly talks about how his parents are immigrants. His parents were incredibly kind - hearted, as they were nice enough to let people stay in their home and share their lives with them. They opened their doors to those in need, creating a warm and inclusive atmosphere. This act of generosity not only showed their big hearts but also contributed to the loving mood of the story. Overall, the author successfully portrays a touching and affectionate mood through the account of his immigrant parents' kindness."
1658	13484	5	3	The author that wrote this story created a rich tapestry of mood. First, the story is filled with a profound sense of love. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, his parents had to leave all that they held dear. They had to leave their native country, their close - knit family, their childhood friends, and their established careers. His parents left behind so much, making a huge sacrifice out of love for a better future. Secondly, there is a great deal of gratefulness in the story. For example, in paragraph @NUM2, Narciso is deeply grateful for what his parents had to give up and for their unconditional love. He also said that what they did was more courageous than anything that he could have ever done, highlighting his high regard for their bravery. Thirdly, there is a blend of sadness and generosity. Narciso is stating how impressed he is by his parents' generosity and he realizes how important friends and family are in paragraph @NUM2. Narciso also states in paragraph @NUM2 that the two lessons that he learned weren't just taught, but were shown through his parents' lives. I think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as I was reading, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
1659	13485	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a warm and happy one. He achieves this by vividly talking about homes, friendship, and his neighborhood. He creates this happy feeling by talking about his home. He describes his simple house, which was transformed into a Cuban home full of character. His kitchen has the wonderful aromas of traditional Cuban food filling the air, making it a place of comfort and joy. The rich skill of cooking, passed down through generations, was also passed on to him. In this house, he experienced the pure innocence of childhood, with carefree days and happy memories. The second way he creates a happy mood is by talking about friendship. He talked about how the landlord's daughter was not only his friend but also his babysitter. This led to a playful and warm tone as he then mentioned his grandparents who also enjoyed a delicious meal at his house, adding to the sense of togetherness. The last way is by talking about his neighborhood. He talked about how the immigrants in his neighborhood all helped each other. They all came to @LOCATION1, hardworking and willing to build a new life. The author also wrote that family doesn't need to be bound by blood, emphasizing the strong community spirit. Those are the ways that the author created a happy mood in the memoir, making the readers feel the joy and contentment within his world.
1660	13486	5	3	The mood that was created by the author was a warm feeling because the text describes a strong sense of pride and gratefulness. Also, it gives a @CAPS1 and a clear sense of a good family relationship. The author skillfully puts genuine feelings into his writing, making the emotions come alive on the page. He details the moments of pride within the family and the deep - seated gratitude for the sacrifices made. The descriptions of the family interactions show a loving and supportive bond. Those are the feelings that the author describes, successfully creating a warm and inviting mood that makes the readers connect with the story on an emotional level.
1661	13487	5	3	"After reading the selection ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1, I have come to the conclusion that as a child, @PERSON1 seemed to have a truly enjoyable and event - filled life. The memoir had a very positive and lively mood to it. One of the things that contributed to this great mood was all the vivid descriptions of parties. I absolutely love parties, and just thinking about those parties during @CAPS1 makes the @CAPS2 - related stress a little more bearable. Another aspect that set a good mood was the talk about how Narciso's parents were always in high spirits and ready to embrace any situation. They seemed to bring an infectious energy to the story. The final element that made the selection have such a wonderful mood was how Narciso talked about all his family and friends. Whenever I think of the good memories I have with my family and friends, it always brings an involuntary smile to my face. Overall, this memoir had a profound effect on me; it made me feel good and truly brightened my day."
1662	13488	5	3	The mood set by the author is one of deep thankfulness. The author clearly states that he is extremely happy to have his parents. He sincerely thanks them for giving him a life in @LOCATION1, while still keeping and carrying out their traditional Cuban ways. It was heart - warming to read about how he was happy to have others come into his apartment and sit down, acting like a part of the family. He appreciates that his parents are selfless individuals who genuinely care about others. Moreover, he also enjoyed the process of learning to cook. He has held onto this love for cooking ever since, and he says that he adores it to this very day. This shows that the author's gratitude extends not only to his parents' care but also to the skills and values they passed on to him.
1663	13489	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is centered around teaching us how to be grateful. It encourages us to appreciate what we have in life. For example, in the memoir, Narciso lives in an apartment with just one bedroom. But he has a deep love for this place because there are and always will be good memories associated with it. Narciso quotes on @CAPS1 @NUM1.... ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This quote truly sums up the whole mood of the story. The very last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" further emphasizes the theme of gratitude and the value of family. It makes us realize that true happiness doesn't come from material possessions but from the love and care within a family."
1664	13490	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of appreciation and happiness. @CAPS1 achieves this by starting with a detailed background, and by the end, moving to the valuable lessons @CAPS1 learned from his parents. First, @CAPS1 vividly describes how wonderful this environment was in paragraph @NUM1. ""My young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... My parents passed on to me... a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air..."" @CAPS1 continues by elaborating on how it was an ideal place to grow up and how his parents showed him the true meaning of generosity. They made the home a warm and inviting place. Next, @CAPS1 says how difficult it was for his parents to leave everything they knew, just for the sake of their children. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 further writes about how strong they were by showing him the value of family, friends, and generosity. This clearly shows how appreciative @CAPS1 was of them. Overall, by communicating this mood, @CAPS1 was able to honor his parents in a more profound way, highlighting their sacrifices and the positive impact they had on his life."
1665	13491	5	3	The mood that I was feeling in this passage was a strong sense of how a simple home, @CAPS1, and a loving family together can create a haven. In this tough @CAPS2 stage in life, you can always turn to your family. There will always be someone who would do @CAPS3 for you without hesitation. This passage really makes you take a moment to realize how incredibly grateful you should be to have a loving family, no matter what challenges you may face. It reminds us that family is the constant support system that we can rely on, and their love is unconditional. This realization can bring a sense of comfort and warmth, making us cherish our family even more.
1666	13492	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez attempted to evoke a heart - warming feeling within you, vividly recalling all those delightful childhood memories. He also encouraged you to reflect on all the sacrifices our parents made in an effort to provide us with a good life. ""They came selflessly, just as numerous immigrants do, to offer their children a better life. This often meant leaving behind their families, friends, and established careers,"" said @CAPS1 while elaborating on how parents solely aspire to give their children a good life."
1667	13493	5	3	In the memoir, the author crafts a @CAPS3 that serves as a beautiful blend of @CAPS2, love, and unity. The author clearly demonstrates @CAPS2 for his home country of Cuba. He passionately expresses his deep - seated love for the unique culinary creations of the Cuban culture, the lively music, and the joyous celebrations shared with his extended family. As a consequence of his @CAPS2, it becomes evident that one can still have a sense of home even when residing in another country. The author also establishes a love - filled @CAPS3 due to the open - hearted nature of his family towards others. His family would graciously welcome many people into their home and forge strong friendships with them, regardless of race or cultural beliefs. The author further sets a @CAPS3 of unity. This @CAPS3 stems from how all the diverse individuals in his neighborhood, despite hailing from various countries, always collaborated effectively and showed the utmost respect for one another. This is precisely how the author set a @CAPS3 of @CAPS2, love, and unity in the memoir.
1668	13494	5	3	There were several distinct moods crafted by the author, some of which were @CAPS1 and peaceful. For instance, he was reminiscing about his first @CAPS2, the comforting warmth of the Cuban kitchen during a feast. There was also a mood of courage, evident in his description of his parents' decision to move to the United States. His deep admiration for his parents' strength and perseverance shines through. Additionally, there is a sense of faith amidst the struggles and hard times they endured. Overall, these various moods paint a rich and complex picture of the author's experiences.
1669	13495	5	3	The mood in this memoir is caring, happy, and loving. First, it is caring. For example, @PERSON1 would go to great lengths for his family. If @PERSON1 didn't take any actions for his loved ones, it would be clear that he didn't care for them. Second, it is happy. For instance, @PERSON1 has a kind - hearted babysitter and a wonderful first friend, which brings a sense of joy. Lastly, it is loving. An example is when he talks about his parents. He is extremely grateful when he mentions them, and the mood effectively conveys this by making the home environment feel truly loved. In this way, the author successfully creates a multi - faceted mood in the memoir.
1670	13496	5	3	The mood was him simply trying to recollect all of his past memories as a @CAPS1 and his home. What he could recall were all positive aspects; there was nothing negative about his home. From what I read, it was a very nurturing and healthy environment. He had good friends and a loving mother. It's easy to understand why everybody wishes their life could be like that, as his memories paint a picture of an idyllic past.
1671	13497	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author is filled with a very appreciative mood. One clear example of this is when he says, ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This simple yet powerful statement shows that he is incredibly thankful to his parents for every single thing they have done for him, from the small daily acts of kindness to the major life - shaping decisions. A second instance is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" By the author saying this, one can vividly see how much deep - seated gratitude he holds for his parents' unwavering support and selfless giving. Lastly, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This tells us that the author truly comprehends the profound impact his parents had on his life, transforming a mere physical space into a place full of warmth, love, and memories. That is the appreciative mood that permeates throughout the memoir."
1672	13498	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is one of deep - seated gratitude. The narrator in this memoir is extremely grateful, as clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He also emphasizes that they have done a more courageous thing than he could ever do, highlighting the magnitude of his parents' selflessness. The narrator is also very proud of his Cuban heritage. He takes great pride in being Cuban, and this pride is evident in his love for Cuban music, which fills his home with a sense of cultural identity and joy. Additionally, he expresses his love for his house in paragraph @NUM2. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" These moments of community and celebration in the house are a testament to the love and kindness his parents shared. The mood created by the author is one of gratitude, as it weaves through every aspect of the story in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."
1673	13499	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, a well - known designer, the mood created by the author in the memoir is one of pure happiness. You can tell that the mood is happy because throughout the memoir, the author fondly recounts all the wonderful times they had in their house in Newark, New Jersey. The author tells about how her family would regularly come over to her house and have delicious dinners together. The dining table would be filled with laughter, stories, and the aroma of home - cooked food. He also tells about how there was always the lively sound of Cuban music and the mouth - watering smell of Cuban food filling the air. They used to have so much fun at that house, with the music setting the rhythm for their celebrations and the food bringing everyone closer. That's how you can clearly tell that the mood of the memoir is a happy one."
1674	13500	5	3	In the short story of @PERSON1, there is a very happy mood that pervades every page. The story has numerous examples of how his family was so kind - hearted. He says how his parents made their house a true home, not just a physical structure but a place full of love and warmth. They put a great deal of their Cuban heritage into the house, from the colorful decorations to the traditional Cuban music that played in the background. The story also reveals that he was incredibly grateful to have parents that gave him so much love and made great sacrifices. Their love was like a warm blanket on a cold day, always there to comfort and protect him. The mood in the story is definitely a very happy one, as it celebrates the love and heritage within his family.
1675	13501	5	3	I think the @CAPS1 was truly happy. I believe he was happy because he has a beautiful house and a loving family. The house was a place of comfort and security, and his family was always there to support and love him. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in @LOCATION1 but still surrounded by his Cuban culture. Even though he is in a new place, the familiar elements of his Cuban heritage, like the music, food, and traditions, make him feel at home. His parents put him in @LOCATION1, I think, because they wanted to live there and start a new and prosperous family. They saw the potential in this place for a better life. That is why I think that this is the happy mood of the @CAPS1 in this memoir, as he thrives in a place that combines new opportunities with his cherished cultural roots.
1676	13502	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the author skillfully creates a warm and inviting mood. In paragraph @NUM1, the speaker vividly shows the readers the abundant love and happiness that flowed through his family's house. There was the delicious cooking by his loving parents, who patiently passed down their culinary skills to him. The passionate Cuban music they played filled the air, which he adored, and there were friends and endless joyous celebrations. This clearly showed a happy mood that the author was crafting, as the scents of cooking, the rhythm of music, and the energy of parties made happiness seem to float through the air. In paragraph @NUM2, Narciso's parents came to this country with the sincere desire to give their children a better life, even though they had left behind the country they deeply loved. This act showed the immense love they had for him, and because of this, he had a truly happy life. In paragraph @NUM3, the author expresses his heartfelt gratitude for his parents' love and sacrifices. This reveals the profound love and appreciation he has for his parents, who transformed a simple house into a home he can always fondly remember. In conclusion, the author effectively creates a heart - warming mood in the memoir."
1677	13503	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, it vividly portrays the mood of Narciso's home and his relationship with his parents. The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful, and richly cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home that was brimming with the aroma of Cuban food and the lively sounds of Cuban music. This clearly states that the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story, there was a sense of hope. They left Cuba and initially lived in a @NUM1 - room apartment, but his parents were steadfast in their hope that they would succeed. The place was also very alive; they always had someone other than their family at the table, and their doors were always open to family and friends. The Cuban music and the enticing food aroma gently drifted through the small space. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents took a simple house and turned it into a warm and loving home, a place full of memories and emotions."
1678	13504	5	3	"The author creates a strong sense of unity and happiness when she is explaining how she had grown in her home, her neighborhood, and with her parents. Narciso first begins to tell us about the place where she grew up and how she was brought up. She says that she was born in a simple, cozy house in Newark, New Jersey. She also mentions that she had lived in a traditional Cuban home and expresses how she is deeply thankful for her Cuban roots. Then Narciso continues by elaborating on the great sense of unity and ""family"" that existed where she grew up. She says she grew in a neighborhood where everyone knew each other well and was like one big, close - knit family. Towards the end, Narciso tells us in detail how much she is grateful for her parents and their selfless love and sacrifice. Throughout the whole memoir, Narciso's main focus is on how she grew, her strong connection to her Cuban roots, her deep - seated gratefulness for her parents, and last of all, her own unique definition of a real ""family"", which is a blend of love, unity, and shared experiences."
1679	13505	5	3	"I think the mood the author created in the memoir is a profound sense of love. Through the memoir, he elaborately talks about his parents' immigration journey, his new home, and the people who were constantly at his house. This vividly shows their love and his parents' selfless nature. He portrays his parents as truly caring people, and it seems that they showed love to everyone around them. Rodriguez says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" They seemed to genuinely put other people before themselves, and they always surrounded themselves with the people they loved, showering them with affection and kindness. In essence, the memoir is a beautiful ode to the power of love."
1680	13506	5	3	The mood of the memoir is one of deep - seated gratitude and thankfulness. It is something @CAPS1 @CAPS1 will never forget, the kind of feeling that lingers in the heart. The comfort of his home was like a warm embrace, a safe haven from the outside world. The memories associated with that home, filled with love and family, are etched in his mind. This mood of gratitude and the comfort of home combine to create an unforgettable experience for @CAPS1 @CAPS1, making it a central part of his life story. In conclusion, the memoir's mood of gratefulness and the allure of home's comfort leave a lasting impression.
1681	13507	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the author was deeply feeling grateful and a strong sense of homesickness. Narciso sincerely explains that he is extremely grateful for his parents and all the sacrifices and efforts they put in for him. ""My parents both shared cooking duties with great enthusiasm and unwittingly passed on to me their own remarkable culinary skills and a profound love of cooking that is still firmly with me today"", which he holds dear."
1682	13508	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", was so vivid that it made me feel as if I was right there in their cozy kitchen, savoring delicious Cuban food, and listening to lively music. Also, he detailed the life of a Cuban immigrant. My grandfather followed the very same path. He was just a young, innocent boy when his family immigrated from Cuba. But he worked his hardest with unwavering determination and became a very successful man. This story completely reminds me of him, and since I have some background with this kind of experience, I truly know this ""mood"" and it deeply speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and then going on to become a very successful person. Finally, the mood he created clearly shows that if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Also, it authentically shows the mood created in a typical Cuban home."
1683	13509	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of being truly thankful. Narciso Rodriguez is genuinely thankful for his parents giving him a warm and loving home in @LOCATION1. The author skillfully created a mood that makes the reader realize they should be thankful for their parents. The great sacrifice and boundless love of anyone's parents (like Rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for, as it forms the foundation of a happy life.
1684	13510	5	3	That he was truly happy. He realized that he has a much better life in @LOCATION1 than what he would have had in Cuba. Although he was in a new place, he still lived in a house that was very much like a Cuban house, with familiar elements that brought a sense of comfort and connection to his roots.
1685	13511	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON2, the mood is incredibly friendly. Anybody was always welcome to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms wide open and their door ajar to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents were always ready to take anyone in because they firmly believed they also would receive the same kindness. Their community had an incredibly strong bond. ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who readily extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other whole - heartedly even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was the essence of life in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the joyful congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the beautiful backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the central theme of their home. @CAPS1 loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood, making it a truly special place."
1686	13512	5	3	The mood created by the author of the memoir is a mellow, unintense and subdued almost sad mood, which is emphasized by the numerous hardships the Rodriguez family (parents) faced in their arduous struggle to give their children a better life. Although slightly depressing, the mood is happy and in a way, cheerful when the author describes how kind and genuinely welcoming the Rodriguez family is in paragraph four. But, the memoir creates the depressing mood in paragraph @NUM1 due to the detailed explanations of the family's struggles in moving to @LOCATION1 and what they had to selflessly give up in order to better their children's life. Overall, between the cheerful mood of the memoir and the sad mood of the memoir, the memoir generates a mellow, calm and serene mood throughout the article, leaving a lasting and peaceful impression on the readers.
1687	13513	5	3	The @CAPS1, which was carefully crafted, created @CAPS2. The @CAPS3 in this story is a very strong and genuinely happy @CAPS4 @CAPS5. They bravely emigrated from Cuba to a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 in the United States, and they were sincerely hoping for a better life for their kids than the life that they had. This noble aspiration is the reason why the @CAPS1 was happy, as it reflects the family's hope and determination for a brighter future.
1688	13514	5	3	"In the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the writing is deeply grateful. The two main examples of what Narciso is grateful for are his rich heritage and his loving family. Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud Cuban. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 he elaborately talks about how he truly loves Cuban food, the art of cooking it, and the lively music, and how he is sincerely grateful for all of them. Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to @LOCATION1 before he was born so that their children could have a much better life. They have selflessly sacrificed so much for their children, including significant social and financial sacrifices. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso writes, ""I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice."" Any sane human being would be truly grateful to have parents that did what Narciso's parents did for him. As is now clearly evident, the main focus and mood of this excerpt from @PERSON1 memoirs is that he is full of gratitude, which permeates every word of his writing."
1689	13515	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is a well - known clothing designer who wrote a memoir titled Home: The blueprints of our lives. The mood created in this memoir is a warm feeling that tenderly surrounds the profound meaning of family and home. Narciso says in the memoir in @CAPS1 @NUM1 ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the enticing Aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocent days of childhood, the joyous congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that embraced both, formed the beautiful backdrop to life in our warm home."" That clearly proves that Narciso's house was a warm family home, that was always invitingly welcoming. Narciso's community was also close - knit like a real family. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it proves this when saying ""Close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who readily extend a hand to people who were clearly in need"". He also firmly states that blood doesn't necessarily mean your family, like his kind surrogate grandparents. In @CAPS1 @NUM3 he proves that his parents were always welcoming as ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"", which shows the strong sense of community and family spirit in his life."
1690	13516	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed and genuinely happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be truly great. For example, Narciso talked about how his unique sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, he described how passionate Cuban music filled the air, beautifully mixing with the delicious aromas of the kitchen. As well as the deep love and great sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all, the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents painstakingly turned the simple house he lived in into a real home. Then, how it was in @LOCATION1 he learned the real and profound definition of the word ""family"", and how to truly love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir smoothly jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real, presenting a rich and multi - faceted view of his life experiences."
1691	13517	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to capture a certain mood towards his parents, a mood filled with happiness and gratefulness. Throughout the entire memoir, Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done and sacrificed just for him to have a better life. His parents gave up their jobs, their houses, they left their family and friends behind there, and in return, they moved to a new place and gave their son a better life. He is constantly expressing how grateful and honored he is to have parents who will give up everything they had for him. Overall, throughout the memoir, Narciso sets a mood of happiness and gratefulness towards his loving parents, making the readers feel the deep - seated affection and appreciation he has for them."
1692	13518	5	3	"The mood in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is clearly a blend of happiness and sympathy. One significant reason is that they never gave up no matter how difficult the circumstances were. Narciso specifically said that his parents, ""drove them to endure these hard times."" This indicates that, regardless of how tough the times were, they remained steadfast and persevered. Another reason is that they maintained a very close - knit relationship with their family. The author wrote, ""all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" This shows that their whole family was extremely close to each other, sharing meals and creating a warm, family - oriented environment. My final reason is that the Rodriguez's always had a helping nature. Narciso said, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,"" which clearly shows that they were always willing to assist people in need. In conclusion, the mood in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is indeed a heartwarming mix of happiness and sympathy, making it a touching read."
1693	13519	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is one of profound gratefulness and happiness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it specifically states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This clearly shows how @CAPS1 sincerely thanks his parents for instilling in him the love for cooking and the valuable cooking skills, along with his eternal gratitude. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 is truly happy that @CAPS1 grew up in @LOCATION1 and is extremely grateful to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and for all their hard work. In essence, the memoir is filled with the author's deep - seated feelings of thankfulness and joy towards his parents."
1694	13520	5	3	"The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author crafted is a deeply grateful one. In the memoir, it states, ""skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This particular quote makes me acutely feel grateful for my own culture and heritage, as it highlights the importance of the traditions and skills passed down through generations. This story also fills me with a sense of pride. In the story, it states, ""My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" I feel extremely proud that they had the determination to leave their homeland to come and have a better life. Lastly, the mood is one of happiness. This story is happy because the protagonist learns a valuable lesson, and he is proud of his parents and his culture. Overall, the author has successfully conveyed a rich tapestry of emotions in the memoir."
1695	13521	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a beautiful combination of calm, niceness, and happiness. It could also be aptly described as heavenly. Narciso refers to his childhood as if it were one long, happy dream. He writes, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This description creates a vivid picture of a carefree and joyous childhood. He also mentions how deeply grateful he is to his parents, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir is Narciso's view on family. He says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this excerpt, it is evident that the author cherishes this time and would undoubtedly love to go back to relive those wonderful moments."
1696	13522	5	3	The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefulness. When I read this memoir, I genuinely feel thankful, just like the author. Although his family had a relatively comfortable life in Cuba, they made the difficult decision to leave in order to give their kids a better and more prosperous life. If the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I firmly believe the mood would be completely different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway). If my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would whole - heartedly want people to feel grateful as well. @PERSON1 truly understands how incredibly hard it was for his parents. Another mood that emerged is guilt. I feel a pang of guilt when I read this because I don't always take the time to thank my parents or fully appreciate them. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez masterfully created a rich tapestry of moods in the memoir.
1697	13523	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood, or how the article deeply made me feel, was a profound sense of gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez wrote this memoir almost as a heartfelt thank - you letter. He wrote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and loving home."" Paragraph @NUM1 uses words that perfectly portrait the mood of thankfulness, like ""eternally grateful"" in paragraph @NUM2, or ""I will always be grateful"" in paragraph @NUM3. Narciso Rodriguez vividly describes all of the sacrifices that were made and all the hardships endured by his parents. He details their selfless journey to @LOCATION1 and starting anew from scratch all so that their children could have a better life - as described in paragraph @NUM4. When I read this memoir, it poignantly reminded me of all of the things my parents have done so that I can be truly happy - so that I can have a safe and loving home. In essence, the memoir serves as a beautiful reminder of parental love and sacrifice."
1698	13524	5	3	"The mood created by @PERSON1, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a deeply comforting one. This is clearly shown, for instance, by his fond recollection of his idyllic childhood in his family's home. For example, he states that he is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents passing on, ""their rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" that he claims to still cherish deeply. Also, he remembers life as being neighborly, where they treated neighbors and friends as integral parts of their family with kindness and generous sharing. This is evident when Narciso says, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open wide to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In addition, the comforting feeling is further emphasized when Narciso says, ""I learned here about how to love.... My parents turned this simple house into a haven of a home."" This shows that Narciso had a wonderful place to grow up in and has warm, comforting memories that will stay with him forever. In conclusion, the memoir exudes a comforting mood that touches the reader's heart."
1699	13525	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a humble one. He has an intense love for his home. He adores the unique scent and the vibrant music and rich culture in his house. In the memoir, he stated that ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, seamlessly mixing with the mouth - watering aromas of the kitchen."" The mood in the memoir is also deeply touching. He says that his mom is extremely helpful and open - hearted to family members in need. He had stated that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" Another example of mood from the memoir is how he elaborately explains how close - knit his community is. He states that all the cultures and ethnicities came together in great friendship. In conclusion, the mood the author created in the memoir is a beautiful blend of being touching, humble, and inspiring."
1700	13526	5	3	"In the memoir by @PERSON1, the mood in the memoir is a combination of gratefulness and friendship. The first indication shows that Narciso was very grateful for the cooking skills passed down to him, which are still with him today. He said, ""And for which I am truly grateful"", which clearly means that Narciso loves his parents' cooking and is extremely grateful. The second indication shows that Narciso has a strong bond of friendship with his parents. ""All of these cultures came together as a family"" in the memoir by @PERSON1. These two instances clearly show how Narciso is both grateful and has a deep - seated sense of friendship within his family and community. In conclusion, the memoir effectively conveys these two important moods."
1701	13527	5	3	There are several types of mood the author created. First of all, the author creates a family full of love in a home where family members are gathered together. Also, the author talks about the relationship based on their nationality. In addition, in the @CAPS1, the family lives all over the basement, upstairs, almost everywhere. The best example the author talks about in the @CAPS1 is where the inhabitants are from. As you can see, this @CAPS1 was a great @CAPS1 that made the word “loved” encompass the whole family. This shows that the author successfully crafted a warm - hearted and inclusive mood within the narrative.
1702	13528	5	3	In the non - fiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a warm, busy, and giving mood. The mood is warm because in the memoir it clearly states “the congregation of family and friends and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home”. This vividly shows that there were a lot of friends and family gathered together in this home, highlighting the togetherness of friends and family. Also, the mood is busy because the memoir mentions “countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet”. This effectively shows how people were constantly coming and going in this bustling home. The mood was also giving. It was giving because the memoir says “It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need”. This shows that people were generous when others needed help, even if they were not of the same kind. Overall, these elements combine to create the distinct mood the author intended in this memoir.
1703	13529	5	3	The author's mood of the memoir is that @CAPS1 is deeply grateful because @CAPS1 tells us in detail how much @CAPS1 appreciates what his parents have done. @CAPS1 appreciates that his parents “immigrated” to the United States so @CAPS1 can have a “better life”. @CAPS1 specifically said that “they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved”. @CAPS1 is truly grateful that his parents made such a sacrifice for him. @CAPS1 is also happy that his parents made their house feel like they were in Cuba, their place of origin. @CAPS1 described that the “Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love”. @CAPS1 is extremely thankful for the “sacrifice” that his parents had to make. @CAPS1 is so grateful that @CAPS1 can hardly “express his gratitude”. The author sincerely thanks his parents for what they've done to make him happy. In conclusion, this shows just how grateful the author is towards what his parents did to provide a better life, and @CAPS1 has truly learned the true meaning of the word “family”.
1704	13530	5	3	The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, “all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship”. During the time period when this story takes place, different immigrants would usually never even consider mingling with each other. This clearly shows that, in Narciso's youth, nobody cared about race and every person in his neighborhood was extremely close to the friendly people around them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is shown is by describing all of his acquaintances as “family”. They have a close enough bond to each other that they can show up at each other's doors and immediately be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life reveals that he grew up understanding that “…' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative” and that one should treat all friends as family. Finally, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 showed their extraordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, “… arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family...”. This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat demonstrates how extremely close they were to everyone they knew. Whether it's by always having their door open, mixing between different races, or considering almost everyone family, the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of humanity, which is a central theme in the memoir.
1705	13531	5	3	The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is very happy and uplifting. The whole story presents an optimistic view of Narciso's childhood. None of the bad parts of his childhood are written about. He writes about his parents coming from Cuba and how some of his family members would come and eat with them. Narciso's memoir offers a happy look back at his childhood. Narciso is very grateful for his family, especially his parents. They came from Cuba to @LOCATION1 to start a good life for their son. This is what causes the beginning of this memoir to start off with a happy, uplifting mood. As the memoir progresses, it still maintains the same happy mood. Paragraph @NUM1 is a great example of how the mood created by the author is so happy. Paragraph @NUM1 elaborately talks about how Narciso's family would go to their house and share meals with them. Narciso was clearly happy to be around his family. The best example of the mood created by Narciso is the final @NUM3 paragraph. Paragraph @NUM4 specifically talks about Narciso's deep gratitude towards his parents. He loves them so much for coming to @LOCATION1 and leaving their promising jobs in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. The final paragraph describes how Narciso's whole family turned a house into a home. This is a very heart - warming paragraph that effectively completes the happy mood of the story. In conclusion, the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is consistently and extremely happy, with no mention of any mad or sad parts of his childhood in the memoir.
1706	13532	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"", the mood in this story is extremely happy and heart - warming. When she elaborately talks about how they cherish their own unique cultures, spend a great deal of time in the cozy kitchen, and sit down at the dinner table together as a loving family, it makes the mood so happy that one can't help but wish they were there. The various immigrants that live in the neighborhood are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard - working. This makes life there seem not only nice but also easy - going. I think about how the parents selflessly give up everything like their comfortable house, delicious food, their beloved Cuba, and everything else just for their kids to attend a good school, eat well, make friends, be near relatives, and have a fulfilling life, all just to make their kids happy. That is a tremendous amount of effort, especially in another country. Another heartening thing they would do is that with their landlord, they would carefully set the table, savor good food, play around, and have lots of fun. It is truly wonderful to have friends and family that genuinely care about you and are willing to sacrifice everything for you. This all makes the mood in the story exuberantly happy."
1707	13533	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, artfully creates a mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood of this memoir could be precisely described as nostalgic or even, to some significant extent, filled with love (as in loving his old home, dear family, close friends, etc.). The author vividly mentions ""endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This effectively helps create the mood because the author is deeply reminiscing on the events that took place in his home (in this case, they were very happy and memorable experiences). The author mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that during a time of blatant racism in the @CAPS1, his community was so tightly close - knit that people were like an extended family. He even firmly states: ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These examples from the memoir powerfully help create a nostalgic mood, and it also clearly shows the profound love throughout the community. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2, the author sincerely says he ""will never forget"" the things he ""learned there about how to love."" Which further builds on these two themes as well (due to the fact he is vividly remembering the feeling of love he experienced and learned). In conclusion, the mood(s) of this story would predominantly be of nostalgia and/or love, which leave a lasting impression on the readers."
1708	13534	5	3	In the passage, the author successfully provided a pleasant mood. For example, he elaborately talked a lot about love, friendship, and other related heart - warming things. He delved into the differences between a home, which is filled with love and memories, and a house, which is just a physical structure. He crafted this passage with the intention of making people start deeply thinking about what love really is and what people will truly do for each other. He is indeed a very talented and empathetic author, capable of touching the readers' hearts through his words.
1709	13535	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", an internationally well - recognized clothing designer, offers the following profound definition of ""family"". In this memoir, the mood set by Narciso Rodriguez clearly shows that he is a deeply grateful person. He is grateful for his rich culinary skills and his abiding love of cooking that has stayed with him to this very day. He is also incredibly thankful to his parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice. If it weren't for their selfless love and sacrifice to come to the @CAPS1.S, he would not be the successful person he is in these days. That's why he is a truly grateful person, and this gratitude is beautifully reflected in the mood of the memoir."
1710	13536	5	3	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is that he was initially not happy about moving to @LOCATION1. However, after being in a warm home with his loving family, his attitude changed, and he started to like it. Even though he had to work hard and he was an immigrant facing various challenges, he was happy. The only reason he was happy was because he was surrounded by his family, and that's what truly matters to him. He was originally from Cuba and immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. The mood of the story is a complex blend of not just pure happiness but also has elements of initial unhappiness and a touch of sadness. This is the nuanced mood created by the author, which adds depth to the story."
1711	13537	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez is one of caring, loving, happiness, and being grateful. These warm - hearted moods stem from Narciso's deep - seated love for his parents, his home, and his culture. Narciso shows a caring mood as he genuinely looks out for his home and parents. He takes pride in the environment they've built together. Moreover, he is truly happy to have a loving home and parents who reciprocate that love and care. He often reflects on the many wonderful moments they've shared. Narciso is extremely grateful for his loving home and parents, as they've provided him with a foundation of love and support. The author created these moods because these are personal and significant memoirs of his life. He deeply feels all of these emotions for the house that has been a haven and the parents he adores. Narciso holds these feelings so close that he will ""never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home"", a place filled with memories and love. This memoir, through these moods, offers a heart - warming glimpse into a life rich in family values and love."
1712	13538	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author effectively creates the mood of familiarity and homyness. First, in the memoir, Narciso vividly describes his home in sufficient detail to give the reader a strong sense of homyness. There are numerous examples of this throughout the memoir. One such instance is when Narciso Rodriguez says, ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" When Narciso writes this, it immediately creates a vivid picture of a place full of love and togetherness, evoking a strong sense of home or homyness. This is just one of the many moods Narciso skillfully makes the reader feel in the passage. Second, Narciso also creates a mood of familiarity, especially for immigrants. He writes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life."" This is a sentiment that all immigrants and the sons of immigrants can readily identify with. So, Narciso manages to create a mood of familiarity with this memoir. Finally, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the overall mood of homyness and familiarity leaves a lasting impression on the reader, making them feel connected to the story and its characters."
1713	13539	5	3	"In the story Narciso Rodriguez, a certain mood is created. For example, one prominent mood is love. Narciso's family did everything out of love. In paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This quote clearly shows that Narciso's family took care of everyone, even though they themselves did not have an abundance of resources. Their self - less love extended to all those around them. Another example of mood is being together. Narciso's family actively helped out all immigrants to get back on their feet. Paragraph @NUM2 says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Narciso's family, with their kind hearts, often reached out to the less fortunate. The mood of this story is very inviting and peaceful, as it portrays a community bound by love and support, where everyone looks out for one another."
1714	13540	5	3	"The mood created by the author is described in many ways. First, he describes a friendly mood. In paragraph three, he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This statement shows that the community around him was so inclusive and friendly that the concept of family was broadened. And in paragraph four, he states, ""... Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" This further emphasizes the friendly and close - knit nature of the environment. Secondly, the mood is described as warm and family - like. In paragraph four, he states, ""Countless extended family members came and went..."" This shows a constant flow of people in and out of the home, creating a warm and bustling family atmosphere. And in paragraph seven, it says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood..."" This expresses the deep - seated warmth and connection he felt. Thirdly, it's a loving mood. In paragraph four, it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows the unconditional love of his parents. And in paragraph six, he says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" To conclude, the mood created by the author is multi - faceted, with friendly, warm, and loving elements that paint a vivid picture of a wonderful life full of relationships and emotions."
1715	13541	5	3	In the memoir written by @PERSON1, he tells about how his parents immigrated from Cuba to The United States with the sole purpose of giving him a better life. He is acutely aware of the sacrifices they made and will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that has remained with him throughout his life. The mood that he sets in this memoir is one of deep - seated gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interests firmly in mind, leaving behind their homeland and all that was familiar. This memoir also reveals that economically, they faced many struggles. However, @PERSON1's family still managed to create a home. They reached out to the people in the area, forming strong bonds and staying very close with them. This gave @PERSON1 a real sense of family, even though his biological family was far away. He is truly grateful for this because he was raised with his Cuban culture, which has become an integral part of his identity. The overall mood he created was gratefulness, a sentiment that permeates the memoir and makes the reader appreciate the power of family and sacrifice.
1716	13542	5	3	"In the excerpt, the author crafted a notably relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing seamlessly with the rich aromas wafting from the kitchen"". This vivid description clearly shows how well - equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was indeed a significant and integral part of Narciso Rodriguez's childhood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the warm congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that beautifully encompassed both, formed the idyllic backdrop to life in our warm home"". This passage shows that the author is trying to direct your attention to the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house had a relaxed and calm atmosphere, which precisely reflects the tone of the author."
1717	13543	5	3	"I think the mood created by the author was very warm, full of gratefulness, and truly happy. I believe this because he often vividly expresses how his parents sacrificed a great deal of things and made his childhood filled with joyous and unforgettable memories. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In many paragraphs, he elaborately explains how he deeply admires them for their strength and unwavering perseverance in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. I also said happy because he is genuinely happy that his childhood was so incredibly memorable. ""Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations."" This clearly shows me that he whole - heartedly enjoyed the parties and the experience of being a kid while growing up in that loving household. This is why I firmly think the mood is so full of gratitude and happiness."
1718	13544	5	3	The mood created by the author overall is a profound sense of gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some key events in his life, you readily notice that he mostly focuses on his family. He emphasizes that you don't have to be a blood relative to be part of the family; what truly matters is the presence of love. Narciso is especially grateful to his parents who selflessly sacrificed their old lives in Cuba so that he could have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were quite good, but when they arrived in @LOCATION1, they had to take whatever job they could find just to make ends meet. Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love, but he also learned the real and meaningful definition of family. He witnessed what immense courage it took for his parents to transform the simple house they once had into a warm and loving home for him. In the end, this deep - seated gratitude is what permeates the entire narrative.
1719	13545	5	3	"IN THE MEMOIR HOME: THE BLUEPRINTS OF OUR LIVES, HER MOOD IS LOVE. This is because she deeply loves her parents for all the significant sacrifices they made, just so Narcisco can have a better life. For example, ""I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO MY PARENTS FOR THEIR LOVE AND SACRIFICE."" She means that she will always cherish and be thankful for what her parents did for her during her childhood, which played a crucial role in making her become what she is now. Another example, ""I WILL NEVER FORGET HOW MY PARENTS TURNED THIS SIMPLE HOUSE INTO A HOME."" She means that her parents selflessly sacrificed to transform a @NUM1 - room apartment into a place that truly felt like home, filled with love and warmth. This love for her parents is the dominant mood in the memoir."
1720	13546	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez effectively set a strong mood of happiness and thankfulness in his memoir. One way he achieved this is by sincerely thanking his parents for passing on their wonderful culinary skills to him. He says in the memoir that he is ""eternally grateful"" and still retains a deep - seated love of cooking, which shows the positive impact his parents had on his life. Another way he set this mood was by vividly explaining how pleasant his neighborhood was. He mentioned that all the different cultures came together in a beautiful display of solidarity and friendship, and everyone in the neighborhood was hard - working, creating a harmonious and positive environment. A third way he did this was by warmly saying how amazing his parents were. He said he was grateful for their love and sacrifice, their unwavering strength and perseverance, and their remarkable courageousness. Through these aspects, Narciso Rodriguez successfully conveyed a happy and thankful mood in his memoir."
1721	13547	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir was very positive and warm, showing deep - seated gratitude, and promoting the real, heartfelt definition of family. An example of his profound gratitude towards his parents is when he states: ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This daily act of cooking together became a precious family tradition. Narciso describes his sense of true family in paragraph @NUM1 when he says: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso describes that his parents were very courageous coming to @LOCATION1 having no previous knowledge of the culture or language. They stepped into the unknown, facing uncertainties with determination. He expresses how thankful he is for his parents to come to @LOCATION1, leaving everything they knew behind, in order to give him a better life. He describes his neighborhood being a true family, adding big dinners together filled with laughter and stories, and helping one another in times of need. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done... I think them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood of the memoir truly does demonstrate the importance of family, love, warmth, and gratefulness, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
1722	13548	5	3	"This is the mood created by the author in this memoir. In this memoir the author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". They filled the house with love, laughter, and countless memories. One reason why this describes the author's mood is that it shows that through all the great times he's had with his family, like holidays spent together and evenings of playing games, they have giving him an experience of a life time that he will never forget. Another reason why this shows the author's mood is that now that his parents have died and he misses them deeply, the only memory he has of them is this house he calls home. Every corner of the house holds a piece of his parents, from the well - worn sofa where they used to sit to the kitchen where they cooked together. That is how the author describes his mood a lot in this memoir, making the readers feel the depth of his emotions."
1723	13549	5	3	"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The author sets a very grateful & loving tone. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" His parents' sacrifice was not just a one - time act but a continuous effort to provide a better life for him. Narciso's parents left everything they ever had behind, including their familiar surroundings and dear friends, to make his life easier. This whole excerpt is a heartfelt thank - you to them. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso ends with ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much he loves them. He could've had a big house where his family lived, but it wouldn't be home. Instead, he had a small house where everybody shared things, like clothes and stories. He could really call it home because of the love and togetherness it held. In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the author sets the tone of gratefulness & loving. I can relate to this story because it reminds me of my family, how they too have made our simple place a warm and loving home."
1724	13550	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a grateful mood. It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankful he is for all the stuff he has, like the simple pleasures of a warm meal and a cozy bed. Another reason why the mood is grateful is because all of the people in the neighborhood will all come together and eat with each other, sharing delicious food and engaging in friendly conversations, visit with each other, and help each other in times of trouble. I know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This gratitude is not just for material things but for the love and support his parents have given him throughout his life. The author successfully conveys a mood that makes the readers appreciate the value of family and community."
1725	13551	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is talking about this boy's life and about his parents and what they do for a living and what they are and how they are nice to other people. His parents are kind - hearted individuals, always ready to lend a helping hand. They treat others with respect and kindness, whether it's a neighbor in need or a stranger on the street. I think the author's mood would be like happy, filled with a sense of contentment. Nice and caring on other people and not being rude. It's all about caring, and love, happiness. The memoir shows how a simple life filled with love and kindness can bring so much joy, and it leaves the readers with a warm and positive feeling about the power of family and human connection.
1726	13552	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: Blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author strongly emphasizes the importance of family. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates is a warm, comfortable, and loving, homey feeling that immediately draws the reader in. He states that he grew up learning that ""family has nothing to do with being a blood relative"", a profound lesson that shaped his view of family. He says that his family whole - heartedly welcomed everybody. This included strangers that needed help, neighbors seeking support, and extended family members looking for a place to belong. He creates a loving mood when he said he lived in a ""close - knit community"" where everyone knew and cared for one another. He also says ""These cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"", highlighting the unity within the community. @CAPS1, when @PERSON2 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"", you can clearly sense his deep appreciation and feel the comforting atmosphere that filled that home. Those were the moods I felt while reading this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, and they left a lasting impression."
1727	13553	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, his mood is very meaningful and sincere. You can clearly tell that what he's saying he truly means it; he is being completely sincere. He says ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" in paragraph @NUM1 line @NUM2, vividly painting a picture of the central role the kitchen played in their family life. In paragraph @NUM2 line @NUM4 he says ""it was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". This shows the selfless nature of the community. Or when he tells us that his first friend was his babysitter @PERSON2 who was his landlord's daughter, adding a personal touch to his story. Narciso Rodriguez tells us how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" in paragraph @NUM5 line @NUM6, highlighting their open - heartedness. He tells us in paragraph @NUM7 second line how his mother and father ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" even if it did mean leaving behind their loved ones and things they loved. In the last sentence of his memoir, he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" With those last words from Narciso Rodriguez, you know that he is sincere about what he's saying and that he could never fully thank his parents for what they did for him, as their love and sacrifice were immeasurable."
1728	13554	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very satisfying and fulfilling mood. The author uses a contented and satisfactory tone, too, especially when the author is carefully explaining what a family is. Near the end of the memoir, it has an even more palpable satisfactory mood. Partly because it is near the end and they are gracefully ending the memoir, and also because it is elaborately explaining what a family truly is. The mood of the memoir is also interesting because the author skillfully uses information from Narciso Rodriguez's life to help explain what a family is. By sharing real - life experiences, the author makes the concept of family more relatable and engaging. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very satisfactory and interesting, leaving the reader with a positive and thought - provoking impression.
1729	13555	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez by The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the author sets a deep and powerful mood to the setting. Throughout this memoir, we feel a sense of joy and contentment as he vividly explains his culture. For example, as it states in paragraph (@NUM1) ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home's."" @CAPS1, the author uses warm and evocative words that fill our hearts with a sense of longing for such a vibrant and loving environment. For example, in paragraph (@NUM2) it states ""But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" And @CAPS2, this author uses @CAPS3 to provide further information which explains Narciso's deep - seated feelings towards certain childhood memories, such as the rich and vibrant Cuban culture. These are three clear examples of how the author effectively sets the mood in this memoir, making the reader feel as if they are a part of that world."
1730	13556	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of deep gratitude and a flood of great memories. Narcisco is obviously extremely grateful towards his parents for teaching him how to love unconditionally and that family or friends should always come first. In this memoir, Narcisco spends a lot of time talking about his wonderful family memories. He recalls all his friends and family coming over for dinner, filling the house with laughter and conversation. His mother would be in the kitchen, cooking delicious traditional Cuban food while the sounds of traditional Cuban music filled the air. Through these experiences, he learned that friends and family members are there to love and spend quality time with, creating bonds that last a lifetime. These memories and the gratitude they evoke make the memoir a heart - warming and touching read.
1731	13557	5	3	"The tone of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a genuinely happy one, with an abundance of positive feelings, cherished memories, and warm undertones artfully mixed in. Rodriguez masterfully sets the mood in the @NUM1 paragraph when @CAPS2 vividly describes the warm, inviting, and irresistibly cozy feeling that permeated his home. Here, @CAPS2 elaborates on how ""passionate Cuban music... filled the air, gently mixing with the mouth - watering aromas wafting from the kitchen."" This description gives off a heart - warming, innocent vibe, effectively staging the mood for the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, the mood is further expanded so that it also encompasses the whole - hearted welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez poignantly says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door wide open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt radiates a proud and graceful mood. This pride and deep gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is clearly directed toward his parents. @CAPS2 uses many evocative words like ""courage"", ""selflessly"", ""struggled"", ""braving"", and ""hardships"" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a distinct proud undertone. Rodriguez then earnestly talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to express in great detail how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him. The mood of this memoir is a beautiful blend of happy, welcoming, warm, grateful, and proud, a mood that would surely make anyone yearn for the one special place where they too could feel this wonderful feeling circulating around them."
1732	13558	5	3	"The mood created by the author was a very loving mood, one that envelops the reader in a sense of warmth and affection. Rodriguez describes his home life as @CAPS1 grew up in Newark, New Jersey, a place that became the backdrop for his cherished childhood memories. @CAPS1 vividly describes the Cuban heritage that his parents based their home upon, including the lively music that filled the rooms and the tantalizing aroma that wafted through the air. ""Endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" @CAPS1 says, painting a picture of a home full of joy and togetherness. @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 grew up with a ""deep - seated sense"" of family, a feeling that was nurtured by the close - knit community around him. His neighborhood was different than much of @LOCATION2 because ""all of these cultures [Spanish, Cuban, Italian] came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" creating a unique and harmonious environment. @CAPS1 expressed the love his parents had by carefully explaining their hard work as they faced financial and personal struggles with unwavering determination. ""@CAPS1 says @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family through his parents, and is very grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" he concludes, highlighting the profound impact his parents had on his life."
1733	13559	5	3	"The mood of this story is undeniably happy. He skillfully paints a picture with words in the @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3 + @CAPS1, vividly telling of the extreme unity and boundless happiness that filled his household, neighborhood, and family. He also clearly shows how happy he is and how deeply grateful he is of his parents. He elaborately paints a picture with words in the @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3 @CAPS1. He says, ""My parents were originally from Cuba, and they came here, and I was born in a simple yet charming house in Jersey. In my house, there was beautiful Cuban music playing in the background and delicious cooking going on. We always had family over and neighbors dropping by,"" creating an idyllic image. In the story, he also talks about the remarkable unity of his neighborhood, which was made up mostly of Spanish immigrants. He elaborates on that in @CAPS1 @NUM3, @NUM8, sharing anecdotes that show the strong bonds among the community members. This clearly shows you how happy he was during that time. In many places in the story, he also sincerely says how grateful he is to his parents and how much courage they had to make the trip. As you can see, the mood in this story is a perfect blend of grateful and happy, a mood that lingers long after the story is over."
1734	13560	5	3	The mood of the memoir is truly pleasant. @PERSON1 fondly talks about her idyllic childhood, reminiscing about the wonderful times she spent growing up. She emphasizes how selfless her parents are to her, always putting her needs before their own. Also, the mood is effectively set when @PERSON1's parents selflessly help other people get back on their feet, showing their kind - hearted nature. She further describes how people would regularly come to eat dinner with @PERSON1's family, creating a sense of community and togetherness. She also tells about how she had family that weren't exactly blood relatives but, they were people who cared for each other like a real family, sharing laughter, stories, and support. Also, the way Narciso told the story was with a very pleasant tone, a tone that made the reader feel as if they were a part of that warm and loving world. The memoir leaves the reader with a sense of contentment and a longing for such a pleasant and caring environment.
1735	13561	5	3	The narrator is vividly describing the life he grew up in, a life filled with warmth and love. He talks about how his parents would lovingly cook in the kitchen, their hands moving deftly as they prepared delicious meals, while Cuban music played softly in the background, creating a magical atmosphere. He emphasizes how great things were during that time, a time of simplicity and joy. He was trying to create a warm, happy mood by carefully describing how his parents selflessly tried to help the people around them and did the best they could with anything that came their way. They showed greatness in life when they barely had much themselves, teaching him the true values of kindness, generosity, and perseverance. His description makes the reader feel as if they are right there in that cozy home, experiencing the same sense of happiness and contentment. It is a beautiful portrayal of a life well - lived, filled with love and the spirit of giving.
1736	13562	5	3	The mood created by the author is warm and appreciative. I believe this because you can clearly tell that the narrator doesn't take anything for granted. I know this because the narrator's parents were given a house, and since the narrator was part of the family, it was their duty to make that house a home as much as possible with their parents. I know this because it mentions it in the text on pages @NUM1 and @NUM2. The author also gives a proud mood in this memoir. I believe this because in the text on pages @NUM1 and @NUM4 it states that the narrator is Cuban and Italian, from Newark, New Jersey, and the narrator seems to be proud of who they are and where they're from. I know all of this is true because it's all in the text, which effectively conveys these distinct moods.
1737	13563	5	3	"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, sets a certain mood after he vividly describes the hardships his family faced to give him a better life. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" Narciso feels truly thankful for what he has and deeply appreciates what his parents did for him. This sets a happy mood because Narciso is genuinely happy with what he has and wouldn't give anything to replace it. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso Rodriguez sets a nostalgic mood because he is fondly talking about his childhood and the past with his family back then. He also explains that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family.""

It looked like he was genuinely happy, perhaps due to positive experiences or a fulfilling life he was depicting. Why wouldn't he be happy when the details in the memoir suggest a life filled with joy and satisfaction? That is the mood created by the author in the memoir, which leaves a pleasant impression on the reader.
1739	13565	5	3	"According to the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a distinct mood throughout the memoir. The mood was happiness because Narciso was truly happy with his life. One clear example of Narciso's happiness is with his home. When Narciso is telling about the apartment he grew up in, the mood is palpably happy. Although it wasn't much, his parents made him feel extremely comfortable in it. They made it seem like Cuba as much as they could. Narciso loved his apartment even if it wasn't Cuba. In paragraph two, ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso was happy with the apartment because his parents made it feel like a warm and inviting Cuban home to him. Another example of Narciso's happiness is with his family. Narciso tells how his friends seem like family. In paragraph four, ""Our landlord and his daughter... do the same for us."" Even though the people aren't blood - related to him, Narciso is still very happy with them. Finally, based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author successfully created a happy mood, which is evident from Narciso's contentment with the life he lives."
1740	13566	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez From Home: The blueprints of our lives, the author sets a sad mood in this memoir. An example of the sad mood set is when the author describes his neighborhood. The author describes his neighborhood by saying ""our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants."" (@NUM1) This shows they live in a run - down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they first arrived at the United States. Another example is when he describes his family. The author says ""There was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". (@NUM2) This shows the poverty that they lived around because they had to provide shelter for those who couldn't afford it. The last way the author describes the sacrifice of his parents, The author says ""The Faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"". (@NUM3) This is a sad mood because it shows how their sacrifice backfired and they didn't have a very happy time. That is why I think the tone of this memoir is a sad one, as the author's descriptions paint a picture of a difficult and unfulfilled life."
1741	13567	5	3	"The mood of this memoir was very happy, and peaceful, filled with a sense of contentment. @CAPS1 seems like he's a very happy person, always wearing a warm smile and having a kind demeanor.

1743	13569	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is peaceful because the whole memoir is talking about love and care for each other and your family, creating a serene and harmonious atmosphere. In this memoir, there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking with great enthusiasm. ""It was the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent in music but life in love"". This quote shows that Cuban feasts caused him to experience life and love with his family and loved ones in a very intimate way. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family"". This proves that his life in New Jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family, which is full of tenderness and understanding. The last quote that made this memoir peaceful was when he said, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote shows the love and affection that Narciso Rodriguez feels about his parents and his home.

1757	13583	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and deeply thankful mood. The reason it is a happy and thankful mood is that he talks in detail about his family and how they selflessly sacrificed so much just for him. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and promising careers in the country they loved so dearly. They struggled both personally and financially, bravely braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for the familiar warmth of their native tropics and facing numerous cultural hardships."" Moreover, he also learned what family really means at a profound level. For example, ""I learned the real definition of 'family'."" And for all these experiences and the love he received, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that his experiences have left an indelible mark on his heart, making him both happy and thankful."
1758	13584	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is a happy and thankful mood. This is because of the vivid happy memories Rodriguez describes in his memoir, the deep gratitude he expresses for his family in the end, and the detailed description of the hardships his family had to endure for him. First, Rodriguez brings a happy mood into the story because of the many happy memories he describes during the memoir. One of them, in paragraph @NUM1, is when he says ""The passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the enticing aromas of the kitchen."" The lively music and delicious scents paint a picture of a joyous and warm - hearted home environment. Second, the gratitude he expresses for his family in the last two paragraphs conveys a thankful mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says, ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the clear demonstration of how important family and friends are."" His words show that the family's influence on him is immeasurable. Third, by describing the hardships his family had to endure for him, Rodriguez furthers conveys a thankful mood. Rodriguez devotes the entire paragraph @NUM3 to describing how unselfish and kind his family was, thus thanking them. In the end, because of the happy memories described, his gratitude he expresses for his family, and by describing hardships his family had to face, Rodriguez effectively conveys a happy, thankful mood."
1759	13585	5	3	"In the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the narrator had shown a palpable sense of happiness throughout the memoir. One example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. They deeply admired when their parents patiently helped and taught them how to cook. As they recalled, they would hear the music in the background that they adored as part of their heritage or background. In the story, it says, ""The passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking."" When the author still lived with their parents, their relatives would come over to eat and have a great time. To reflect back on those memories, with the laughter and togetherness, made the author extremely happy. In the story, it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet."" Another example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to @LOCATION1. They thought of how lucky their parents were to come to such a nice place, as it offered new opportunities for the family. In the story, it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" These memories and thoughts combined create a happy atmosphere in the memoir."
1760	13586	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very thankful. Again and again, Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for several of the precious things that they gave to him that he still values deeply. First, he thanks them for passing on their love of cooking and music which he says he is ""extremely grateful"" for and which he, ""adores to this day."" He is thankful for how they brought him up, clearly showing this by writing how much he still enjoys these things today. The love of cooking and music has become an integral part of his identity. Next, Narciso Rodriguez says how he, ""will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He describes in detail how they did so much to give their child a better life. They sacrificed their well - established laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in @LOCATION1 to give their children more opportunities. His parents left behind, ""their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Moreover, they did all of this with, ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" The parents' unwavering sacrifice was driven by their deep love for their children. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, is extremely grateful for all that his parents have done, and this gratitude permeates the entire memoir."
1761	13587	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is to show a deep - seated gratefulness towards the author's parents. He vividly wanted to portray the fact that his parents selflessly sacrifice their lives for the author's life. Narciso repeatedly conveys the clear message that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", but rather, it consists of people who sincerely care for one another; people who ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"". The most important family to Narciso are his parents who make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives, in order ""to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their beloved families, close friends, and promising careers in the country they deeply loved"". He firmly says that he will always be eternally grateful to his parents. He honestly admits ""that what they did was a much more courageous thing than ""he"" could have ever done"". In fact, Narciso cannot thank his parents enough for showing him how truly important family and friends are. In the end, @PERSON1 realizes that a home is not just a physical place where you live, celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is warmly welcome, and a home is a family in itself, a haven of love and support."
1762	13588	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was described passionately and emotionally, with every word dripping with deep - felt gratitude. The overall mood in this whole memoir was one of pure gratefulness. Starting from the very beginning, the author fondly recalls how his family lovingly passed on their rich traditions. Moreover, he was fortunate to have people around him, both family and friends, who were always there to help, living in close proximity. His parents made the ultimate sacrifice, giving up everything from their past just to start a family and provide a better life. They sacrificed all they had in life, leaving behind familiar places and cherished memories. As a result, his life was filled with abundant joy and happiness, all thanks to the unwavering love and support of his family and friends, which made his life truly special.
1763	13589	5	3	The mood story the author creates is a prideful memoir of his life and home, and he vividly details what others did for him while living in a time rife with hate and racism. He feels deeply and foreverly grateful for the unconditional love and selfless sacrifice his parents showed to him. He was overjoyed that during these difficult times, people of different cultures and ethnicities were treating everyone in the community like family, breaking down the barriers of prejudice. The mood and emotion of this memoir are a beautiful blend of pride and love for others, along with a genuine sense of caring. This memoir serves as a testament to the power of love and unity in the face of adversity.
1764	13590	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage, a courage that shines through every word. ""I will always be deeply grateful to my parents for their boundless love & selfless sacrifice. I've often sincerely told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Another clear example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their close - knit families, dear friends, and well - established careers in a country they deeply loved. This unwavering courage is the very mood the author masterfully creates in this memoir, inspiring readers with the story of his parents' brave journey."
1765	13591	5	3	"In the story The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the @CAPS1 creates a rich and evocative mood. Here is how the mood is crafted. The first mood is centered around her house. She colorfully describes friends and family gathered together, with the lively Cuban music filling the air, creating a vibrant atmosphere. Along with the music, the delicious aromas of the kitchen waft through the space. Here is one vivid example of the food and music ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the mouth - watering aromas of the kitchen. Another mood is related to the family and friends. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"", showing a warm and inclusive environment. And those are some well - defined reasons how the @CAPS1 set a mood in The Blueprints of our lives, making the story come alive with emotion and charm."
1766	13592	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive one. The author vividly tells the story of how his parents immigrated from Cuba in 1956, seeking new opportunities and a better life. He was born in 1961, growing up in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout his account, he never said one negative thing about his life there. He fondly mentioned how his parents had a deep - seated love for cooking, and that love was gently passed down to him over the years. He sincerely said that he was extremely grateful for that. He also noted that, along with the cooking, there was the Passionate Cuban music that filled their home. He described his neighborhood as a wonderful place where ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" As a final sentence, the author stated with emotion how we ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."
1767	13593	5	3	In the memoir by @PERSON1, he seems to be extremely happy. He has a big, close - knit family that is always there for each other, and a large @CAPS1 of friends who share in his joys and sorrows. He has many good memories, from family gatherings to fun outings with friends. He comes from a very caring and sharing home where love and support are freely given. The whole mood of the story is very uplifting, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and contentment.
1768	13594	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, ""home"", and comfort. He vividly recalls growing up in an apartment where ""countless extended family members came and went"", filling the place with life and energy. His life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends who were like family. Narciso remembers that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"", and this created a strong sense of belonging. Comfort is evident as he describes ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forming the beautiful backdrop to life in our warm home."" There's also a deep sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to @LOCATION1 from Cuba. As he says with sincerity, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And all of this -- the sense of belonging, comfort, and gratitude -- creates the powerful sense of ""home""."
1769	13595	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is deeply grateful for the way his Cuban parents brought him up when they had so little to start with. One significant thing that the author is grateful for are the Cuban traditions that his family passed on to him. One of the most cherished traditions would be their rich culinary skills and a profound love of cooking. Another important thing the author is grateful for is that his mother and father came to this country to give him a better life. Even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, careers, and the country they loved so dearly. That sense of gratitude was the dominant mood created by the author in this memoir.
1770	13596	5	3	The mood the author created was how they were immigrants and they had to adjust to the @CAPS1 way of life. It wasn't easy, but they managed to adapt while still holding on to their cultural roots. They celebrated his first birthdays in that very house, filling it with the joy and traditions of their homeland. They will always be grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and great sacrifice. It was a clear demonstration of how important family and friends are in life. And that I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a place full of love, memories, and a true sense of home.
1771	13597	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive and grateful mood, specifically directed towards his home and his parents. One clear example of the mood established by the author is in paragraph @NUM1 when he sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Here, the author is once again emphasizing how thankful he is that his parents made the journey to @LOCATION1. Another instance that showcases the mood of the story is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Through this statement, the author highlights the self - less nature of his parents' decision. A final example of the mood crafted by the author is when, in paragraph @NUM3, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" By uttering this quote, he not only expresses gratitude for his parents' sacrifice to come to @LOCATION1 but also for being raised in the traditional Cuban way. He also implies that he had numerous wonderful memories growing up in this home and that he and his family bonded with their multi - racial neighbors to overcome the tough times. Overall, the memoir has a very positive, happy, and cheerful mood centered around the Cuban family."
1772	13598	5	3	"The mood is effectively shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is a blend of happiness and a strong sense of family. The first clear example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Here, @PERSON1 is clearly showing that just because someone is not related by blood to another person, they can still be considered family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author is demonstrating that people who love each other like family stand by each other, no matter what the circumstances. A final example is when the author states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The author is expressing that he is grateful for the people who showed him what ""family"" truly means. In closing, this story beautifully portrays true family and how a simple house can transform into a warm and loving home."
1773	13599	5	3	I would say the mood that the author was in was one of pure happiness. I come to this conclusion because he always has something kind and positive to say. He never gets into any squabbles with his mother or father. He often talks about how he is incredibly grateful. He emphasizes that he would never argue with his parents and that he has always had a wonderful life, from his childhood days to now when he is an adult. He is also looking forward to moving into a new @NUM1 - bedroom apartment soon. He sees this new place as an opportunity to create his own home, where he can continue to experience the same kind of happiness and contentment he has always known.
1774	13600	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our Lives"" tells the story of a kid from Cuba. The memoir has a very positive mood. It describes how the family keeps family or friends in their home until they are back on their feet. It also gives us a glimpse into the neighborhood where the kid lives. There are many different types of immigrants in the neighborhood, and they all get along harmoniously. The kid's parents often invite friends and family over for dinner. The parents made a huge sacrifice, giving up their jobs, friends, and families in their home country so that their kid could have a better life and grow up in @LOCATION1. This self - less act and the warm community they built around them contribute to the overall positive mood of the memoir."
1775	13601	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a warm and inviting ""homie"" feeling. The author makes an effort to let the readers know that a home is more than just physical walls; it is a place where relationships are formed and nurtured. The author refers to ""The congregation of family and friends,"" which is significant because all the joyous times and celebrations took place in the home with the people he loved. The author tries to vividly show the love and affection that permeate throughout his home. He says ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Through such descriptions, the author effectively conveys the love that is constantly present in his home, making it a truly special place."
1776	13602	5	3	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a very warm, happy, and loving mood. As clearly stated in the memoir, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This heartfelt statement means that he is genuinely happy and deeply appreciates all that his parents have done. It also mentions, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance"". This further shows that he loves his parents and is extremely content with their actions. The last thing the memoir says is ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This indicates that he was very thankful for the cozy and loving environment they created. Throughout Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, a happy and loving mood is consistently expressed, making it evident that family and parental love are the central themes."
1777	13603	5	3	"It creates a vivid mood of happiness as the description ""but Cuban music filled the air as it mixed with the aromas of the kitchen"" paints a lively picture. This shows that his home was a place full of energy and joy, where the combination of music and delicious scents from the kitchen created a warm and inviting atmosphere. It gives the readers a sense of the vibrant and happy life he experienced at home, making it clear that home was a place of comfort and contentment."
1778	13604	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a deep appreciation, which is clearly shown through the author's feelings towards their parents. Another prominent mood is the pure happiness associated with ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author openly expresses being grateful to her parents for their unwavering love, self - sacrificing nature, and great courage. These qualities of the parents are highly valued by the author. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how warmly refugees that just arrived in the country were welcomed at their house to stay. The description that ""the warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her truly learn the real definition of ""family"". This shows that the family's actions and the home environment played a crucial role in shaping the author's understanding of family."
1779	13605	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives"", the mood created by the author is that his parents were truly loving and caring individuals. His parents were loving and caring because they put in a lot of effort to transform their house into a warm and inviting home. When they came to the United States, his parents were selfless and caring. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This clearly shows that his parents were loving and made significant sacrifices so that their children could have a good life. In paragraph @NUM2, it mentions ""they struggled both personally and financially"". This further demonstrates that they cared deeply about their family as they sacrificed personal comforts and endured financial hardships to make their family happy. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is one of caring and loving, highlighting the strong bond between the author and his parents."
1780	13606	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso's mood in the memoir seemed extremely happy and grateful. Narciso's mood sounds so happy because when he was sharing with us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining the details of his house, he was talking about how kind his landlord and the landlord's daughter were. He mentioned that the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he also emphasized how close - knit his family and friends were. In the neighborhood, despite different customs from elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father worked hard to make the house cozy. At the end of the memoir, the author said ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home"", meaning that he had never experienced a home as wonderful as the one he lived in then. This shows that his upbringing was filled with love and happiness, leaving a lasting impression on him."
1781	13607	5	3	"In this memoir, I think the mood is a genuinely warm and nice one. One clear example of how it's warm is the way the author describes the home. For instance, it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This evokes a warm mood because when you envision a kitchen, you typically think of a cozy, warm room filled with the sweet aromas of delicious food baking in the oven. A reason why it is a nice mood is that all of the cultures in the memoir got along and treated each other like family. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is truly nice considering there was a lot of racism at that time, yet all the cultures managed to overcome it together. The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how the author appreciates what his parents have done. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This clearly shows that he is extremely grateful that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life. That's why I firmly believe the mood of the memoir is warm and nice."
1782	13608	5	3	The mood in this memoir is very notably relaxed and proud. The author vividly showed that he was incredibly proud of his parents and his rich culture. He spoke with a laid - back, relaxed feeling, clearly loving everything about his home and his cultural heritage. Moreover, the mood is also one of great gratitude. He is deeply grateful for his neighbors and how they all came together in unity. Additionally, he was thankful to have his family and friends gathered in his apartment. The author's sense of pride in his life and his parents was palpable throughout the memoir, making the overall mood a beautiful blend of relaxation, pride, and gratitude.
1783	13609	5	3	"There are several distinct ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir. First, he carefully described his house when he had first moved in. He mentioned that it was a simple, unassuming house, situated in a two - family building that was a blonde - brick structure. This detailed description set a certain tone. Second, he conveyed the message that one should be happy with what one has and be truly grateful. He emphasized that the word solidarity was a significant one and held deep meaning. Last, he painted a picture of the hope that he had regarding his parents and his home. He stated phrases like ""which I am eternally grateful"" and ""which I adore to this day"". These various elements combined are the different ways on how the author effectively created the mood in the memoir."
1784	13610	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is unmistakably one of greatfulness. I think this because the author, Narciso, uses the word ""grateful"" over and over again to drive home the point. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful"" (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2, he also clearly states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Throughout Narciso's memoir, he lists all the things he is thankful for, making it evident that greatfulness is the predominant mood of this passage."
1785	13611	5	3	"The mood that the author in the memoir created was a positive one through his love, his blood - relatives, and also through his courage. To start with, his love is an integral part of his life. He deeply loves his parents. For example, in the story, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This clearly means he loves his parents for every single thing they have done for him. Also, he learned how to love other people as well. As for his blood - relatives, they have a significant connection to his story. He is from Cuba and came to the United States in 1956. He was born into a simple house, where his family built a traditional home. This is how the author effectively described the mood, through his love, his blood - relatives, and his courage."
1786	13612	5	3	In the memoir, a rich tapestry of moods was vividly expressed. After careful reflection, I firmly believe that the mood that emerged most prominently was happiness. Narciso, with great warmth, described to us that regardless of the challenges that came their way, her family and close - knit friends would always share a deep - seated sense of belonging with one another. This unwavering bond gave everyone mentioned in the story ample reason to be jubilantly happy and to hold positive feelings about themselves and each other. In conclusion, the strongest and most enduring mood in the story was indeed happiness.
1787	13613	5	3	In the story memoir, the author skillfully crafted a couple of distinct moods to vividly depict the narrative. The first mood that stood out was gratefulness. The author poignantly described a profound sense of gratefulness towards the parents when detailing their selfless and caring nature. Specifically, when the parents made the difficult decision to move to @LOCATION1, it was all in the hopes of providing their family with a better life. The last mood described by the author was happiness. The author painted a heart - warming picture of happiness in the story when depicting how the parents' actions made everyone feel right at home. These are the different moods artfully described in the story by the author.
1788	13614	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, delves into the life of the fashion designer and the mood crafted by the author. After his parents immigrated from Cuba, Narciso was deeply and sincerely grateful. As he put it, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (para. six). Narciso holds his Cuban heritage in high regard and has a strong belief in it. When they came to @LOCATION1, his neighborhood was a vibrant melting pot filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All of these neighbors he whole - heartedly considered as part of his extended family. He was truly thankful for the life, the wonderful friends, and the steadfast family support that his family had provided him. His parents had imparted valuable life lessons through their own lives, and these teachings have served as the very foundation of his life. Narciso is grateful for coming to @LOCATION1 and for successfully bringing the essence of his old home in Cuba to his new home in @LOCATION1."
1789	13615	5	3	In this memoir, the mood created by the author exudes a very positive aura. The author has a remarkable ability to transform @CAPS1 not - so - good situations into much better ones. For instance, when they had a very modest and small house, they infused it with so much love and warmth that it became a true home. The kind - hearted people living in this small house opened their doors to others, allowing them to stay until they got back on their feet. These generous individuals made the entire building a more pleasant place to be by preserving and celebrating their old culture. In conclusion, the positive mood in the memoir is a testament to the author's ability to find the silver lining in difficult circumstances.
1790	13616	5	3	"The mood is @CAPS1 in numerous ways. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 and it is as if the person was elated to immigrate to the @LOCATION1. Also, it is @CAPS1 in a sad way, as the text states, ""... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". Another evident mood is bravery. In my opinion, these immigrants are incredibly brave because I can't even fathom leaving behind my friends and, especially, my family. Another mood that shines through is gratefulness. As one quote says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclusion, these are the many ways in which the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2."
1791	13617	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blueprints of our lives, the mood is heart - filling and centered around appreciation. In the memoir, @CAPS1 sincerely says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their unwavering love and selfless sacrifice."" @CAPS1 deeply thanks his parents for every single thing they've done for him. @CAPS1 also tenderly states, ""I will never forget how my parents, with so much care and effort, turned this simple house into a warm and inviting home."" @CAPS1 realizes it wasn't an easy task but loves how his parents managed to give him the best life possible. @CAPS1 writes, ""what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 clearly knows his parents took risks and did whatever it took to keep him happy, which sets this mood to be so warm and heart - filling, truly making the memoir a beautiful ode to parental love."
1792	13618	5	3	"Warmth In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author skillfully created the mood in many ways. One way the author creates the mood is by vividly saying (paragraph @NUM1) ""The very heart of which was the kitchen; passionate Cuban music filled the air. Here, the innocence of childhood, the lively congregation of family and friends, and endless joyous celebrations"". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like an extremely friendly and inviting place due to the people gathering together, sharing laughter and stories. Another way the author creates the mood is by stating that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". (paragraph @NUM2) These are the effective ways by which the author of ""Narciso @CAPS1"" created the warm and inviting mood in this story."
1793	13619	5	3	"The @CAPS1 sets a wonderful mood in this memoir about his house. The @CAPS1 clearly states that the house is a powerful sign of life and love. The @CAPS1 elaborately says, ""always filled the air with not just the pleasant scent and lively music but also life and love."" The @CAPS1 explains the mood through the description of a delicious Cuban feast. Also, when he discovers that in the neighborhood, there is a strong sense of love too. The @CAPS1 states, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many valuable things I learned there about how to love."" The @CAPS1 shows how various cultures and countries' people in the neighborhood, mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, found satisfaction at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1. The @CAPS1 shows a good, positive, and generous mood in the book that all started in the cozy kitchen with a mouth - watering Cuban feast, making the memoir a celebration of love and community."
1794	13620	5	3	"The mood set in this memoir by the author is one of great fullness, and it seems to be a heartfelt thank - you to his Family for such a loving childhood. It also seems @CAPS1 deeply misses that wonderful time. ""I was born into this simple house,"" @CAPS1 says with a touch of nostalgia, ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" @CAPS1 was extremely comfortable in his home and truly loved it. It seems as though the excerpt was made to sincerely thank those who @CAPS1 lived with. As it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the excerpt, @CAPS1 further explains how caring and generous his family and neighbors were. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author tells about his neighbor constantly making delicious, home - cooked meals, and their dinner table was always filled with many neighbors and blood relatives. The author had a very close, almost like family, relationship with his neighbors, making this memoir a beautiful tribute to community and family love."
1795	13621	5	3	"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love. The reason why I say love is because to me, he genuinely cares about his family. He also firmly stays with his family tradition, showing that he respects and follows them whole - heartedly. He clearly loved being with his family. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 in the article, it says; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents, with so much love and dedication, turned the simple house into a home."" And to me, that powerfully shows love. That's why I think the author created love as his mood in the memoir, making it a touching and memorable piece about family and love."
1796	13622	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving and happy for a multitude of reasons. It is loving because Narciso truly and deeply loves his family. He is extremely grateful for his parents who selflessly gave up their own lives to offer him a better one. As he poignantly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It is happy because the entire memoir revolves around family and friends, and it vividly depicts how wonderful his childhood was. ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These are the most prominent moods that this memoir portrays, leaving a lasting impression of warmth and contentment."
1797	13623	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and gratitude. The author is deeply grateful to his parents for providing him with a roof over his head, ensuring he has nourishing food to eat, and for being such courageous individuals. Their unwavering support and bravery in the face of challenges have allowed the author to lead a fulfilling life. The author's sense of gratitude is palpable throughout the memoir, and this feeling of happiness and thankfulness is the dominant mood that the author conveys. It is a testament to the profound impact that the author's parents have had on his life.
1798	13624	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir was mainly centered around family and love. For the majority of the memoir, the author was sharing the experiences he had within the house, and the deep - seated love he held for his family and friends. The first example I have for the mood is when he states, ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This clearly shows the selfless love that the parents have for their kids, willing to make sacrifices for their future. A second example for the family aspect is when the reading says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family'"". Here, he is talking about how they are all so close - knit. This reading serves as an excellent example of a close - knit community and the sacrifices that parents make for their kids, highlighting the strong bonds of family and love."
1799	13625	5	3	"The mood in the author's story is one of happiness and gratitude. It is a happy mood because even though they arrived in a new country, they came with a clear purpose and are living their lives while preserving their culture, which has been passed down from family to family for generations. As the author describes, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved."" The author is also grateful as he clearly sees all that his parents have done and continue to do for him so that he can be happy. As he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And the description ""I was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love!"" further emphasizes the happy and grateful mood that permeates the story."
1800	13626	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of pride. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving and caring child in the US. He took pride in the fact that even though his family moved to the US from Cuba, he still actively practices his Cuban culture. Another reason for his pride is that he has loving parents who whole - heartedly want him to be successful in life. His parents played a crucial role in helping him keep up with his culture by regularly having family come over. As the quote ""My @CAPS1 Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary… regularly joined us at our table."" (ph @NUM1) shows, Narciso Rodriguez's family would come to join his parents and him for dinner. Narciso's family made the difficult decision to give up everything, including leaving Cuba, so that he could have a better life, a life that his family can rightfully be proud of. This pride is evident throughout the memoir, making it a dominant and inspiring mood."
1801	13627	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is non - fiction. The mood is that way because Narciso Rodriguez is vividly telling about his past in his memoir, and it is about the life he once lived in a Cuban, Italian, and Spanish neighborhood in New Jersey. The house was carefully transformed into a warm home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a charming blonde - bricked apartment, filled with the enticing Cuban Aromas and lively Cuban musics. The mood became truly joyful because of the Family's deep - seated love of Cuban Music and delicious Cuban cooking, (which is really mouth - watering). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family residing in a nice apartment building. The mood is non - fiction, joyful, loving, and caring. I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasant to envision, with all its warmth and charm, truly making it a special place in the memoir."
1802	13628	5	3	The mood was artfully created by the author in the memoir, and through specific information, I can sense the mood. It's like the mood is something intangible yet ever - present in the sky, a feeling that lingers and colors the entire narrative. That's why I can clearly perceive and think about the mood, as it weaves through the words of the memoir, leaving a distinct impression on the reader.
1803	13629	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. Loving is what they did most because they basically called everyone their family. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"", showing the inclusive and affectionate nature of their relationships. Another mood was caring, because they whole - heartedly wanted their children to have a better life. An example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give their children a better life, leaving their friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This clearly shows they care deeply about their kids. One last mood is appreciative. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start their life over, yet they persevered"". These are the moods that were created by the author, which add depth and emotion to the memoir."
1804	13630	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives is Love and @CAPS2. Love is shown in this excerpt by how incredibly grateful he is for his parents and how he genuinely feels about them. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"", expressing his deep - seated admiration and love. @CAPS2 is shown by the way Narciso vividly described the house he grew up in. Stated in paragraph @NUM2 that ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", painting a picture of a lively and special place. Love and @CAPS2 are expressed all throughout this memoir, and I have stated just a few examples of how these moods are beautifully portrayed in the text."
1805	13631	5	3	The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She starts off by briefly telling a little history of how she came to be in @LOCATION1 but quickly shifts the focus to what her home was like. Narciso emphasizes the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. She talks about how the vibrant latin music and the large - scale Cuban cooking all contributed to making what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude she has for her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's deeply focused on how her parents selflessly made a simple house a loving home, which is the heart and soul of the memoir's mood.
