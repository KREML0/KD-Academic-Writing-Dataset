1	8863	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because gardens simply cannot thrive when there is snow covering the ground. The cold and snow create an inhospitable environment for plant growth. So, she figures that once all the snow has completely melted, she'll make an attempt to grow another garden. I feel as if she wasn't quite happy enough about the prospect of growing another garden. I think she should be more enthusiastic and interested in growing it rather than being disappointed. After all, a new garden holds the promise of beauty and life.
2	8864	4	3	The narrator includes that in the paragraph because it all makes perfect sense and it flows together seamlessly. The details fit well within the context of the narrative. The narrator says that when the geese come out and the hibiscus is budding, it is because once again, it is spring. Spring brings with it the return of the geese and the blossoming of the hibiscus, marking a new season of growth and renewal.
3	8865	4	3	The author concludes the story with that passage to clearly show the great importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Throughout the story, Saeng was consistently comforted by the hibiscus plant because it vividly reminded her of her home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains Saeng's attitude towards her new country and her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the winter is not as visually appealing in the bitter cold, but it manages to adapt and survive, and then returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Similarly, Saeng is initially bitter about her new country and the driving test, but she is in the process of adapting, and will surely be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to strongly stress the significance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant, which is a key element in the story's theme.
4	8866	4	3	The author ended the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows change. The melting of the snow represents a significant change from the cold, harsh winter to the warm, inviting spring. The return of the geese represents a new life, as if they are coming back to something that is semi - new to them. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed, starting anew. The budding of the hibiscus represents growth, both in a physical sense and metaphorically. The author will be older and more knowledgeable and more skilled than before, ready to face new challenges and opportunities. This change and growth are important aspects of the story's message.
5	8867	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” because it effectively takes us back to the key things that happened in the story. Saeng had failed the test before, which was a set - back in her journey. In the spring, the hibiscus will be budding again, symbolizing new beginnings and hope. Saeng realized that many of the things she initially thought were strange, such as the calls of the snow geese, were now almost familiar to her. The melting snow will clearly tell her that it is now spring, a time of change and renewal. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that Saeng will pass the test. Her mother will be proud of her, which will strengthen their bond. Also, Saeng will start to become accustomed to her new country and her new surroundings and stop constantly reminiscing about her life back in Vietnam, fully embracing her new life.
6	8868	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about when Saeng will take the test again. The author specified the time with the season of spring. In spring, all the snows were melted, and the geese were flying back while the hibiscus was budding. This idyllic spring scene not only sets the time but also creates a hopeful atmosphere. And this paragraph makes the reader understand more easily. This is why the author includes this paragraph in the story.
7	8869	4	3	"The story ended with the author saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is quite upset about spending @NUM1 on a plant that she had felt was different from the plant at home. She had high hopes for it, thinking it would bring a piece of home with her. She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the hibiscus buds, as if waiting for the right time and the right signs of renewal."
8	8870	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring the story to a proper closing. In the paragraph, she is basically saying that when the geese return and her flower is budding, she'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll have adapted well enough to the new environment and she'll have experienced enough life's ups and downs, just like the plant that has withstood the winter and the geese that have made their long - distance journey. She is comparing her life's growth and readiness to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower, which adds a beautiful layer of symbolism to the story's end.
9	8871	4	3	The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before, and that failure left a mark on her. However, she is a determined person and wants to pass it. The way the paragraph is presented makes you really wonder if she will pass it or not. It leaves a sense of anticipation, as if the outcome is still uncertain and full of possibilities. This open - ended nature makes the story more engaging and memorable.
10	8872	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, it concludes the story with a heartening ending. In the story, the girl buys a Hibiscus that reminds her strongly of home. She goes home and tells her mother that she failed her test but bought the plant. While she was carefully planting it in the soil, she saw geese flying in the sky and was immediately reminded of home. America, which once seemed so foreign, was now starting to feel more like home, and she was much happier. In the text, she says, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is willing to give the test another try and is confident that she is sure to pass it. America is now starting to feel a little more like home, and this new sense of belonging gives the story a warm and satisfying conclusion."
11	8873	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story initially began with Saeng failing the test. After the failure, she went out and bought a plant as a means to comfort herself, and then she confessed the test result to her mom. The plant was closely related to her through the memories of her homeland. When she failed that test, she felt extremely depressed and sad. She shed tears to express her pain and decided to buy a plant to lift her spirits. As she told her mom about the failure, she felt the pain all over again. However, her mother made her favorite food and assisted her in planting the plant. She was aware that it wasn't exactly like the old plant from her homeland, but it was the thought and the memories attached to it. She knew that she couldn't simply give up. So, when the right time arrived, she was going to attempt the test once more. This conclusion relates to the story as it helps the readers better understand the narrative and shows that she wasn't going to quit easily. Her mother was very understanding, and when she goes to retake the test, she will be well - prepared. That is how it relates back to the story and wraps up the overall theme of perseverance.
12	8874	4	3	I think he concluded the story with this paragraph because there are certain recurring things in the story and the report. Just like the geese, they leave and then come back, only to leave again. This cycle of departure and return is symbolic. When we talk about taking the test again, it might be similar to the geese's pattern. It could imply that facing challenges is a repetitive process, and one has to keep trying. The conclusion with this paragraph helps to emphasize this idea of continuous effort and the cyclical nature of events in the story. So, that is what I think taking the test again means in the context of the story's conclusion.
13	8875	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when everything in her life starts coming back to normal, when the familiar routines and the comforting elements return, she will take the test. This shows a sense of waiting for the right moment, a moment when she feels ready and confident. The author uses this conclusion to convey that facing challenges should be done at the appropriate time. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it ties together the theme of patience and readiness in the face of difficulties.
14	8876	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a strong sense of determination that Saeng possesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is visibly very upset, with tears welling up in her eyes. Her mother, at first glance, is disappointed in her for buying the plant, perhaps because of the circumstances or the cost. But then, when she realizes that Saeng was distraught due to her recent setbacks, she becomes understanding. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which provides a small amount of comfort to Saeng, aiding her in regaining the determination she needs to recover from her disappointment. The story says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote clearly states that Saeng is starting to understand that things at home can be similar to things in her new country. The author uses the term “familiar” to express that Saeng is gradually starting to accept the fact that some things may be different, but she will eventually get used to them. This acceptance makes her view on life more positive and shows her growing determination to adapt and move forward.
15	8877	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph, there is a great deal of information that forms the main part of this story. For example, all the names mentioned, the discussions about the seasons, and their comparisons and differences are crucial. It also talks about different stages of plant growth, like when you get the mids, the nuggets, and the headies of the plant. These details about plant growth are significant as they can be symbolic of the character's development in the story. Because hibiscus is a new form of something nice, perhaps representing a new beginning or a fresh start. The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story as it encapsulates the key elements of the narrative, from the description of nature to the underlying themes of growth and change.
16	8878	4	3	He states this as the conclusion because it clearly shows the deep - seated faith that she has in the flower. She wholeheartedly believes that this flower will bring her the much - needed luck for her upcoming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place, just as she is in this new environment. They can relate to certain things, sharing a sense of being somewhat adrift yet hopeful.
17	8879	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it vividly shows those moments when she is reminded of home. I firmly believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was in full bloom and it strongly reminded her of the warmth and comfort of home. For example, Saeng mumbled, “Not like the kind we had before.” This clearly suggests to me that she was probably deeply homesick. Then when spring arrives and the flower blooms, it could give her the inner strength and determination to pass the test. This is precisely why I believe the author ended with this paragraph, to convey this sense of hope and connection to home.
18	8880	4	3	The author uses it because Saeng regained her confidence from planting the hibiscus and all the experiences that took place that year. Through the process of planting and caring for the hibiscus, she found a new sense of self - assurance. So now she is fully ready to face whatever lies ahead, and that is exactly what the author wanted the reader to understand from the story.
19	8881	4	3	The author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus provides her with comfort, and she feels a strong similarity to the geese. For example, Saeng clearly says “I - I failed the test.” She has openly admitted to failing the test and is quite upset about it. She sincerely wants to “take that test again.” Additionally, Saeng says, “And that rich sweet scent - that was familiar, too,” while describing the hibiscus. The comforting familiarity of the plant soothes her and will enable her to build up the necessary courage to “take the test again.” Finally, at one point Saeng thoughtfully thinks to herself, “the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng feels a kinship with the geese in this way, and this realization allows her to decide to take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” The author concludes the story strongly, effectively describing how Saeng's failure, the comfort from the hibiscus, and her connection to the geese all play a role in her future decision.
20	8882	4	3	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be constantly reminded of her homeland and the longing to go home. The reason I say that is quite evident. The geese are gracefully returning home, and she deeply desires the same. Also, the hibiscus will be budding in the wild, just as it did back in her homeland. This imagery of the geese and the hibiscus serves to strengthen her connection to home and leaves the reader with a sense of her yearning and hope for the future.
21	8883	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently. This is done in order to teach her more lessons, especially considering that she failed the test. In the middle of the passage, Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the springtime, she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she first found out that Saeng had failed the test. This shows that the author's way of ending the story aims to inspire Saeng to grow from this set - back.
22	8884	4	3	They probably ended it like that to build suspense or leave the reader on a good note. Some people in @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them. In @MONTH1, Saeng might get her license and they might get more money. This ending leaves the possibility of a brighter future open, which is an effective way to engage the readers and make them hopeful about the characters' fates.
23	8885	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the main character, Saeng, undergoes many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country, which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Evidently, the author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that Saeng has found new hope, which is symbolized by the hibiscus flower. Now, along with budding new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value about her home. Sometimes, the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse. Then, that leaves room to start anew, and this ending gives a sense of renewal and optimism for Saeng's future.
24	8886	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that just because you fail once you shouldn't give up. From what was expressed in the paragraph, it was implied to me that Saeng will become stronger by spring and be able to pass the test. This ending encourages the readers to understand the importance of perseverance and gives a positive outlook on Saeng's ability to overcome her challenges.
25	8887	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routines and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don’t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter and is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flower come back, she will take the test of trying to fit in her new country. That is why the author chose this to end the story, as it draws a parallel between the natural cycle of life and Saeng's journey of adaptation, giving the story a sense of harmony and hope.
26	8888	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, “When they came back…then I will take that test again.” This is because it leaves many unanswered questions that the reader might have. For instance, the reader is left pondering about the circumstances around the test and what led to the failure. The reader then might be intrigued and want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph draws attention to the reader. Many of the unanswered questions revolve around, “I failed the test.” We also do not know about “her gentle grandmother”, “Mrs. Lambert”, and “home”. Who are they and what role do they play in the protagonist's life? Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have an effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, “when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ended with the specified paragraph as it adds an air of mystery and anticipation.
27	8889	4	3	I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She will wait and take the test once it's not cold anymore. So, she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. Spring is a season of renewal and new beginnings, and it seems fitting for her to attempt the test at this time. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. These natural signs of spring represent hope and a fresh start for her. This is why I think she ended it like this because these elements of nature mean something to her. They are a symbol of her own journey of adaptation and growth.
28	8890	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the driver's test. The hibiscus, a plant from her homeland, also represents how something from her past has come to America and must now survive. Just like Saeng, it has to endure the new environment. When it begins to bud, it's a sign of new life and growth. Similarly, Saeng will begin to start adapting to America by passing her driver's test. It's all about trying to become accustomed to changes. When Saeng feels bad for failing, that something from her past, like the hibiscus, is such a comfort to her. It reminds her of her roots and gives her the strength to face the challenges of her new life. In conclusion, the ending paragraph effectively ties together the themes of change, adaptation, and the importance of one's past in the face of new beginnings.
29	8891	4	3	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and persevering. For example, when the author says “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding”, she shows the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring. The snow melting represents the end of the harsh winter, and the geese returning symbolize the cycle of life and the return of something familiar. The hibiscus is starting fresh by budding again, just like Saeng is starting anew by retaking the test. This is why spring is when Saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that Saeng, like the hibiscus, is persevering. The hibiscus is persevering by making it through the winter and blooming again while Saeng is persevering by retaking the test. Despite facing failure, she is determined to try again. The author ends with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of hope and optimism about Saeng's future.
30	8892	4	3	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from a lot. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding are all signs of the season change that remind her of home. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. These natural phenomena create a sense of familiarity and comfort for her. With Saeng saying that it makes you wonder why she won't take the test again until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen. These elements from nature are like a security blanket for her, giving her the confidence and courage to face the test once more. In conclusion, the author's choice of ending the story this way emphasizes Saeng's emotional connection to nature and her need for a familiar environment to overcome her challenges.
31	8893	4	3	The concluding paragraph clearly explains her next goal. She had to take an important test, but unfortunately, she failed it. She then paid over nineteen dollars for a beautiful plant. This plant vividly reminded her of her old home. She will have confidence in the spring because the plant has adapted well to its new home, and she believes that just like the plant, she will also adapt and thrive in her new home.
32	8894	4	3	The author concludes the story with his final paragraph because it sets a positive tone for the future. She will take the test in the spring, and she is determined to do her best. As she said, “I - I failed the test,” Saeng openly acknowledged her setback. However, failing a test doesn't mean that it's the end of everything. She will have more confidence next time she takes the test, knowing that she can learn from her past mistakes.
33	8895	4	3	The author concludes the story, “winter hibiscus,” with this paragraph of the story, for several relevant reasons. By concluding the story in this way, it clearly shows Saeng’s growth, and her increased willingness to strive and do her best. When she says she will take the test again, it vividly shows her gain of confidence, and her beginning to feel more comfortable in the place that is not her home country. She is now actively striving and working hard toward doing her best to become successful. And she is making the very best of the given situation. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the story in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, “I - I failed the test,” to now setting a clear goal for herself to take it again, the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle by ending the story in this way, from speaking of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to stating that she will re - take the test next year, creating a satisfying and meaningful conclusion.
34	8896	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it effectively shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which immediately makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also learns that she failed a test and feels out of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The author chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng’s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome her obstacles and be hopeful of a better future, leaving the reader with an optimistic impression.
35	8897	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng and her mother go back to their old home, they find that the flowers there were more beautiful than the flowers where they are living now. She wants to plant flowers that are going to remind her of her home. In the story, Saeng's mother said that these flowers aren't as pretty, but they are strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus, her mother wanted her to know, is a symbol that the only thing that matters is that the plant can last through winter, just as Saeng can endure the challenges in her new environment.
36	8898	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show that just because Saeng failed that test, it doesn't mean she's giving up. She clearly stated that when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. What the author means is that right now she has failed, but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to retake it. And by the time she's ready to take the test, the snow will have melted away, it should be warm out, the birds will come back, and the flower will be growing fine. At that point, she will take it. And the way the author ended it not only lets us know she's going to take it but also, through the choice of words, implies that she will not only take it but pass it too. This ending gives a sense of hope and determination, showing that setbacks are just temporary and success is achievable with perseverance.
37	8899	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus has started budding, and she's visibly happy now. The budding hibiscus seems to symbolize new beginnings and hope for her. So, she's saying that after the geese come back and the snow melts, she's going to do all over again. This indicates that she's ready to face the challenges once more, undeterred by past difficulties. The changing of the seasons represents a fresh start, and she's embracing it with optimism, determined to make a new attempt and achieve what she desires.
38	8900	4	3	The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time, and as someone who is less than a year from taking the test myself, I can relate deeply. No matter how many times I fail the test, I will never give up. We need to persevere through every problem we encounter in life. If we don't and we just give up, we will never get anything done in life. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. This shows her determination and resilience. I hope I pass my driving test the first time, just like I did the learner's permit test. Also, you can't give up on anything at all, even something as seemingly small as work. If you stop working, you will lose your job. So, we must always keep going and never give up, as success often comes to those who persevere.
39	8901	4	3	The author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She clearly expresses that she much rather do gardening than school work. Gardening seems to be her passion, and she loves the process of planting new things. The snow might also hold a special significance for her, perhaps representing purity or a clean slate. Her love for these natural elements is evident in her words and actions, and the author uses this sentence to highlight her deep - seated connection with nature and her preference for activities related to it.
40	8902	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that Saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout the story, it repeatedly says how she feels out of place, just like the “winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story, she says, “many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become, through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” That quote clearly means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means she is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding, “then she will take that test again.” Therefore, the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how she will adapt as well as the hibiscus. Just as the hibiscus endures the winter and blooms in spring, Saeng is overcoming her initial discomfort and is ready to face new challenges, indicating a positive transformation and a promising future.
41	8903	4	3	The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this poignant paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in a deep sense of sadness, after she fails her driving test and is deeply missing her home, it is still a powerful symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is in full bloom, her hope will also blossom, and she will gather the courage to try again, maybe this time achieving success. Right now she may be sad and scared, but she firmly knows that things will work out, and she will be just fine. She is finally gradually settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so intensely, she is slowly getting accustomed to her new home, and her new life. And perhaps by the spring she will be truly happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to take on her driving test once more. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future, encapsulating the narrator's emotional journey.
42	8904	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng is most at ease when she is surrounded by things that remind her of her homeland. She believes she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to form delicate buds. The narrator says “A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden…” This is strong evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well vividly reminds her of it. The narrator also says, “Overhead, a flock of wild geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,” which proves that the geese symbolize her home as well. In this way, the author uses these elements to tie together Saeng's longing for home and her anticipation for the future.
43	8905	4	3	I believe the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of valid reasons. One is to clearly show that the character isn't just going to give up easily, that her failing was not the end for her. This shows something like the morale of never giving up. It feels as if the character is referring to the hibiscus in a very meaningful way. “The hibiscus will be budding” which means that she herself will branch out and learn more new things. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to muster the courage to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also strongly reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the inner courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her driving test. The ending quote also neatly wraps up the story. It also shows the character's strong will of not giving up and to always keep trying, leaving a positive message for the readers.
44	8906	4	3	The author uses this concluding paragraph to artfully draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant, three important subjects found throughout the story. When she says “when the snow melts and the geese return”, she is precisely referring to the geese mentioned when she says “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky”. She went through a significant change, much like the geese do every winter when they migrate. She realizes “that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...familiar to her now”. We all have to go through changes in life, and Saeng just had a much bigger one, which the author effectively conveys through these elements.
45	8907	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same fundamental idea that it had in the paragraph and incorporated it into his story but added a few more details to it, along with some problems and other relevant things. By doing so, the author makes the story more engaging and relatable. The additional details and problems help to flesh out the narrative, making it more vivid and realistic. This way, the conclusion not only ties up the loose ends but also leaves a lasting impression on the readers, showing how the story has evolved from the basic idea presented earlier.
46	8908	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show how Saeng is deeply respectful and how her feelings are filled with longing for her homeland. As a first example, when “Saeng vowed silently to herself,” it clearly shows how she respects and misses her homeland. This vow tells that she wants to bravely try again regarding her failure in the past. Another instance is when she expresses her determination to overcome her past failure. The last line of the paragraph, “then I will take that test again,” indicates that she desires another chance in her life. These are the examples that explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, highlighting Saeng's strong - willed nature and her emotional connection to her roots.
47	8909	4	3	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to create an effect as if they were on a completely clean slate, just as if they had freshly started over. In this way, the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she experiences a bit of relief right after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph, she sounds extremely sure of herself. She sounds so certain, as if she whole - heartedly wants to start over. When she says, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it makes her seem like a brand new person who has truly forgotten about the past, ready to embrace a new beginning."
48	8910	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant catches her attention when she is coming home after failing the driving test. So, she decides that when everything is in the right state, she will take the test again. The driving test isn't that important to her in a sense that she might not pass it easily, but she still wants to go take it again. She wants to attempt it when the plant she bought is budding and at its very best point. This shows her connection with the plant and her hope that the right time will bring success in the test.
49	8911	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively shows how much Saeng has grown because of this entire experience, and how determined she has become. This last paragraph offers a sudden yet happy ending to a rather sad story. It gives the reader hope, knowing that the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness as Saeng's family had to move to a new country and start all over from scratch. However, the one thing that serves as an escape for them is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a beautiful garden and enjoyed spending time with it very much. Now that they are in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland and how their life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvenate her hope of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it clearly shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about, marking a positive turn in her journey.
50	8912	4	3	The author used the last paragraph because the hibiscus is a significant symbol for Saeng. It clearly shows that she will be fully ready when spring arrives. When the plant is on the verge of budding, she will have the faith needed for taking the test. She'll probably want to carefully take care of the plant before she takes the test, nurturing it as she nurtures her own confidence. When the plant finally buds, Saeng won't have to worry about taking care of it anymore, which also symbolizes her readiness to face the test with a clear mind and new - found courage.
51	8913	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng, after failing the test, is expressing that when the good times return, specifically in the favorable season of spring, she will muster the courage to attempt the test again. As an illustration, on page @NUM1 at the top, she stammered, ""I - I falled the test."" This failure was disheartening for Saeng, as passing the test held great significance for her, especially during the rejuvenating time of spring. That's precisely why I believe the author concludes the story in this way, as it showcases Saeng's determination to overcome her setback and achieve success when the opportune moment arrives."
52	8914	4	3	"Winter Hibiscus"" is a story about a young girl named Saeng, who made the journey from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After experiencing the disappointment of failing her driver's test, she decides to walk home. Along the way, she stumbles upon a hibiscus. As she stands there, ""She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair…"" Intrigued by this discovery, she ventures to a flower shop to check if the hibiscus can be purchased. Despite the plant being rare and valuable, and thus quite expensive, she pays a significant amount of money for it. This hibiscus is of great importance to her because she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam, which bring back cherished memories. She brings the plant home and tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam. The mom acknowledges that it also reminds her of their homeland but is not pleased with how much Saeng paid for it. Nevertheless, Saeng plants it in her garden. As ""When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by."" This sight seems to symbolize a new beginning. When the hibiscus returns in the spring, all the flowers start to bud and bloom, and everything takes on a fresh start. Saeng sees this as a sign and decides that she will take her driver's test again, believing that in this season of renewal, she will have a new chance to pass the test and move forward in her life."
53	8915	4	3	"I think that the author included that part because she is comparing herself to a flower. Just like a flower goes through a cycle of growth and dormancy, she believes that when she experiences growth again, similar to a flower blooming, she will be ready to prove herself and pass that test. She is conveying the message that there is always a second chance in life. She wants to share with everyone that it's okay to have misses or make mistakes. For instance, ""they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up season."" This shows that life has its ups and downs, and just like the changing seasons, there will be opportunities for growth and redemption. So, she is using the metaphor of a flower to express her hope and determination to overcome her past failure and achieve success."
54	8916	4	3	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every person to understand how deeply she feels about the hibiscus. She regarded the hibiscus as a truly wonderful plant. In her description, she mentioned that it was ""smooth and cool"" toward the end of the first page. When she first encountered the plant back in Vietnam, she had the perception that it simply grew wildly in its natural environment. However, when she saw it in the United States, growing in a pot, she was quite surprised. To further emphasize her affection for the hibiscus, she described the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent."" @CAPS1, this is precisely why she concludes the story in this manner; it is all because of the profound emotions and attachment she felt towards the plant, which she wanted to convey to the readers."
55	8917	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it vividly shows Saeng's passion for gardening. Her willingness to take the test is closely tied to her eagerness to see if her plants, especially the hibiscus, can thrive. When spring arrives and the hibiscus starts to bud, it ignites a spark of excitement within Saeng. She is so eager to engage in gardening that she is determined to attempt to grow the hibiscus during this season. This eagerness is palpable, as it demonstrates her anticipation and hope for a successful gardening experience. Her enthusiasm for gardening is not just a passing interest but a deep - seated passion that drives her to face challenges, such as taking the test, in the hope of seeing her plants flourish. It is this unwavering passion that the author wants to highlight by concluding the story in this way, showing Saeng's dedication to her gardening dreams.
56	8918	4	3	The author concludes the story with this specific ending to convey that when all aspects of life are restored to a normal and beautiful state, that is precisely when Saeng will take the test. She did this deliberate choice to clearly show that Saeng is fundamentally a spring - oriented person. Saeng has a deep - seated fondness for working in the garden during the spring season, enjoying the fresh air and the blooming flowers. Moreover, it implies that Saeng has a strong belief that she can achieve better academic results in school during the springtime, perhaps due to the pleasant weather and the rejuvenating atmosphere.
57	8919	4	3	Change and disappointment are indeed heavy burdens that are enough to overcome. There are some people who have an intense, almost arid fear of change. For Saeng, the main character from “Winter Hibiscus,” change arrives in the form of a move to a new and unfamiliar location, @LOCATION1. Everything around her, from the scenery to the people, is different and new. Coupled with the disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the overwhelming feeling of living in a state of helplessness washes over her. After purchasing a winter hibiscus plant, she makes a firm vow to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The remarkable resilience of the winter flower and the precious memories it represents serve as a powerful inspiration for Saeng to gather the courage and try again.
58	8920	4	3	I think the author intended to vividly express Saeng's state of mind when she took a solemn vow. The author also aimed to convey the exact way Saeng felt at that moment. When the statement was made, I believe it was not only to arouse the readers' interest but mainly to help them gain a deeper understanding of Saeng's emotions and motivations.
59	8921	4	3	For shadowing, future reference, and continuous behavior, all these are valid reasons why that is the last paragraph. They are relevant for shadowing because the text is telling you something that Saeng says she is going to do in the future. She clearly outlines what she plans to do in the future, thus making a reference to her future actions. She is also maintaining the behavior from before. As she says she will do something again next year, it shows a pattern of continuous behavior. She said, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” So, shadowing, future reference, and continuous behaviors are very good reasons to believe that what she says is significant, and these three aspects best describe what she said and her future plans.
60	8922	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story in this manner to vividly show a sense of continuation in life. In the story, Saeng takes a “test” and unfortunately fails. She then goes out and makes the decision to buy a hibiscus plant, paying well over what she should have for it. Her real test is to try to overcome the memories of her real “home,” a place that now makes her cry only when she thinks about it. To Saeng, the plant is a powerful symbol of the memories and the life that she once had but no longer possesses, yet she deeply desires to have it back. Her vow to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her, she will gather the strength to go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home. She will then try once again to say “home” without breaking down and without having to spend an extremely large amount of money.
61	8923	4	3	"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what specific test Saeng has failed. However, through the careful selection of subject matter and word choice in the story, it is clear that this test is not only of great importance to Saeng and her mother but also holds significance for her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story, Saeng's longing for her homeland is overpowering. The flood of vivid memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus are obviously painful and are a part of her everyday life. Saeng is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive while knowing that she must learn to adapt to the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are some things she doesn't need to change, like the goal of passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive; she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentence of the story is so empowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together - memory and change, ""when this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again"". This shows her determination to move forward while still holding on to her roots."
62	8924	4	3	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl, Saeng, had adapted to her new country. Saeng deeply missed her home. It was incredibly hard for her to say her new country was home without crying. She stammered, ""It's not like the wind we had at - at -."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a beautiful hibiscus plant because it reminded her so much of back at home. One could infer she had adapted because she was familiar with the season change in her new place, and it states that when the geese return, she is going to take the test again. This indicates that she is now in tune with the natural cycles of her new environment and is ready to face the test once more, showing her growing adaptation."
63	8925	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example, it says, ""the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" I think the author says this because all the things in that sentence remind her of home. The hibiscus plant and the geese are things she had at home. So when winter is over and these familiar signs of nature reappear, she will feel better and more confident to take the test. This conclusion shows that Saeng is finding comfort in the natural elements of her new surroundings that are similar to those in her homeland, and it gives her the strength to move forward with the test."
64	8926	4	3	The reason why the author ended with Saeng's vow is because she is very committed. She failed the first time, but now she really wants to pass it. So she is waiting until the snow melts and the @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is budding @CAPS2. At that time, she will come back and take the test again. This waiting period shows her patience and determination. She is using the natural signs of renewal and change as a signal for her own new beginning, indicating that she is ready to face the challenge with a fresh perspective.
65	8927	4	3	I think that the author concluded the story like that because throughout the whole story, the plot was set in the winter. She might have wanted Saeng to try the test in a different season to see if she might do better with the whole situation. The winter might have symbolized her difficult adjustment period. By waiting for a new season, it could represent a new start and a chance for her to perform better. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that, as it gives hope for a more positive outcome in the future for Saeng.
66	8928	4	3	I think the author finishes the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng truly means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she mentions when the snow melts and geese return, clearly indicating that next spring she will take the test again. She expresses this with confidence as she starts to add more details. For example, she adds “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng's words reveal her determination to pass the test. This is precisely why this was the last paragraph and what she intended by it, showing her unwavering resolve for the future.
67	8929	4	3	The author concludes the story with “in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again” because she is suggesting there will be a new year. For instance, she failed it the first time, so she will patiently wait until she tries again. Another example is that she simply wants to keep trying until she obtains her driving license. This final statement in the story encapsulates her perseverance and hope for success in the coming year.
68	8930	4	3	In this story, Saeng shows her mother how passionate she is about planting and her love for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can vividly show how the character Saeng feels about her planting. One reason why this shows that she has passion for planting is because it says “I will try this test again,” meaning that if she is engaged in something that she truly enjoys doing, then she will keep trying it again and again until she is fully satisfied with the results. This clearly reflects her deep - seated passion for the activity.
69	8931	4	3	The author concludes that in the paragraph. I think the author concluded that in this way because it shows a great deal of confidence about her. For example, when she said, “then I will take that test again,” it sounded very confident. It implies that she is willing to try again if she fails the first time. This conclusion effectively portrays her positive and determined attitude, leaving a strong impression of her self - assurance.
70	8932	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams. Despite any setbacks or difficulties she may have faced, the words in this paragraph convey her steadfast determination. It serves as a powerful reminder that she remains committed to achieving her goals, and that her dreams are still very much alive. This conclusion leaves the reader with a sense of hope and admiration for her resilience.
71	8933	4	3	Hope, a new beginning, adjustment—all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it reminds her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were there. The sight of the flower makes her recall the warm afternoons and the gentle breeze of her hometown. And by the flower blooming, she realizes it could be wonderful there too. She’ll also have a new beginning in the spring. By spring, she should adjust to her surroundings and have new friends to share laughter with, interesting things to do, and new memories to look back on. Then, looking back at the flaws won't be as bad. The flower will bring her hope and comfort during her adjustment, helping her face the future with more confidence.
72	8934	4	3	The author is saying that she’s not doing anything until it is a nice day outside. She specifically wants the weather to be neither too cold nor too hot so that she can come out and play with her children. She imagines the joy of running around with them in the fresh air. Then she said she will take her test again when there is a nice day outside for her. This way, she can approach the test with a more positive and relaxed mindset, making the whole experience more pleasant.
73	8935	4	3	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew. When Saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. She dreams of making her mother proud in this new land. When Saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. The plant represents a piece of Vietnam in their new American home. When the conclusion says, “I will take the test again”, it shows that Saeng is willing to try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping traditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like, bridging the gap between the two cultures.
74	8936	4	3	The author might have concluded this story because it is like a downfall. Which means like right now he’s at the bottom and has to make it to the top. He is currently facing difficulties and setbacks, but he refuses to stay there. He is going to start over and take the test again, but this time he is not going to fail. He has learned from his previous mistakes and is determined to succeed, ready to turn his situation around and reach the heights he desires.
75	8937	4	3	The author had concluded her paragraph like this for emotion. This last paragraph gives emotion to know she can’t garden due to winter. In the winter time, all of her plants die for the season. The cold and harsh weather takes away the beauty and life from her garden. The author is just saying Saeng is coming back. After the snow, frosts and cold weather are gone, Saeng will come next season so she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. She eagerly anticipates the return of the warm weather to resume her beloved gardening activities. As said “I will take the test again” by Saeng. Meaning Saeng will come back and take the test of effort with her gardening and her mother next time/ next season when her plants start to grow again. She is ready to face the challenges of gardening and family expectations anew, with renewed hope and determination.
76	8938	4	3	I think that the author concludes this particular paragraph as the ending because that is precisely what the girl is going to be engaged in for the upcoming year that is about to pass. She will still be by her mother's side, assisting her out in the garden. With no friends around, she'll only let her mom into her world. This simple yet meaningful situation ties up the story nicely, showing the girl's focus on family and the garden as her current life.
77	8939	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to vividly show how Saeng has found inspiration from the hibiscus plant. Just like the resilient plant, Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will bravely try the driving test again, and the plant will endure the harsh, brutal winter months. The plant will bloom vibrantly in the spring, showcasing its tenacity during adversity. Saeng will also surmount the adversity she faced when she failed her driving test and when she realized how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense, will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despise and homesickness, will not prevent her from living happily and taking the test over again. The hibiscus reminds her of the strength needed to persevere. The story ends with the paragraph to clearly show how the “Winter Hibiscus” has taught her something valuable about overcoming obstacles.
78	8940	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng is going to whole - heartedly accept her new home and recognize the similarities between her old home and the new one. She will hold the precious memories close to help her overcome the obstacles that she is currently facing in life. “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This statement sets obvious similarities from their old home to their new home. It shows that while things do change, there are also constant elements. This leads to the conclusion because this is the moment where Saeng realizes that she will always have the warm memories of her old home and will use them as a source of strength to overcome the troubles she's going through. In this way, the story comes to a fitting end, highlighting Saeng's growth and acceptance.
79	8941	4	3	The author ends the story the way she did to clearly show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are alike and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its own. Saeng's main obstacle is adjusting to her new life, and the first crucial step in that process is passing her driver's test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother, “I - I failed the [@NUM1].” The hibiscus must make it through the cold winter. It also has to adjust to new surroundings to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng, “... but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters” [@NUM2]. So, if the winter hibiscus's job, or the hurdle that it has to jump, is to make it through and stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be successfully done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, “... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” [@NUM2]. If Saeng's obstacle is completing and passing the driver's test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes its “test,” the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirit to adapt, will grow even deeper because they will both adapt and pass their respective obstacles at the same time, thus emphasizing the theme of resilience and adaptation.
80	8942	4	3	I think that the story came back to this point because that is exactly what the story starts off with. It all began with Saeng going to take a test, full of hope, but unfortunately, she did not pass it. The weather at that time might have been a contributing factor. So, when the weather is better, she believes she would have a better chance of passing that test. This is the reason why I think the story came back to the test. It creates a full - circle effect, showing Saeng's determination to overcome the initial setback and achieve success.
81	8943	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she deliberately wanted to leave the reader in suspense, constantly yearning for more. You can clearly tell this because the story never really explicitly says what the test actually is. She intended for you to actively try and guess what the nature of the test might be. When Saeng walked up to her mother, she sorrowfully told her that she had failed the test, leaving the reader curious about what the future holds.
82	8944	4	3	"The author ends the story with that paragraph, specifically to give a subtle insight on the next story. I firmly think there will be another story because there are clear clues to support my theory. Just at the very beginning of the paragraph, right when they come back, there are hints. Then at the end, it states ""then I will take the test again."" It doesn't end with a typical ""happily ever after"" or anything similar; it just starts to mention those personal changes. So, I believe what the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will successfully pass her test and how her journey will progress."
83	8945	4	3	The author ended with this paragraph because it is a perfect example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. For instance, the geese will return home after the harsh winter to start a new family. Also, in the winter, the hibiscus leaves will wither and die, and then in the spring, they will have a brand - new start. I think the author uses this paragraph last because it's a powerful metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start, and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test, just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life, bringing hope and renewal.
84	8946	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back vividly symbolize Saeng's strong determination and unwavering hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will patiently wait for the long winter to pass so that she can attempt to pass the test. The coming of spring also beautifully symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the precious chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and much - needed encouragement. This is an outstanding way to end the story because it is really profound and makes the reader deeply think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and the arrival of spring significantly affect the conclusion of the story, leaving a lasting impression.
85	8947	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to imply that he will wake up in spring time when the thick snow melts and the geese return gracefully. Also, I think that the author is quite fond of the setting of spring, perhaps to see the bright sunny skies and the geese floating serenely in a pond. I also would greatly like that setting because it gives me more creative ideas and it's a very charming and peaceful setting to be around. That is precisely why I think the author picked that paragraph to conclude the story, as it captures the essence of hope and new beginnings.
86	8948	4	3	The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is about a young girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1, a place with a distinct cultural backdrop. The story vividly tells about the girl's transition into this different culture, facing various challenges and adjustments. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test, which seems to be a significant milestone in her adaptation. At the end of the story the author wrote “In the spring…then I will take that test again.” In the text, the girl says “it’s - it’s not a real one,” when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing, just a faint echo of her past. Also the author wrote “… much preferred it to the Big Mac”. This quote clearly shows that she misses her own culture and cannot fully adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girl's test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change gracefully and also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness, as she continues to navigate her new life.
87	8949	4	3	The author concludes the story with that ending because he specifically wanted to show the reader “if you just try, you might like it”. This message is conveyed through the girl's determination. That's why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt, a time of renewal and hope, so she can take the test again, showing her resilience and willingness to face the challenge anew.
88	8950	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything seamlessly together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happened in the beginning, such as the initial curiosity or longing, and tying it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam, filled with familiar scents and landscapes, to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dug it up and smiled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar fragrance filled her lungs."" This shows that the flower she found in the flower shop gave her vivid memories from Vietnam. This is precisely why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, as it encapsulates the essence of her journey."
89	8951	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it is telling / showing us that Saeng is going to earnestly try to pass the test in the spring. Getting that hibiscus reminded her of her homeland, with its unique sights and sounds, and it gave her warm memories of then. And it also made her believe in herself and want to get there and try again. It made her hopeful. The author uses the description “when snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” to help clearly indicate that it's going to be spring when she tries to take her test again, setting a positive and promising tone for her future attempt.
90	8952	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he figures after all that has happened, like she failed the test, he wanted the end to be remembered as a happy thing. He wanted to bring a sense of optimism. Also, he wanted the end to show how something bad happened, but next she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldn't give up easily; she goes after what she wants with determination. And he wanted that message of perseverance to be the last impression left on the reader, which is why it's the last paragraph.
91	8953	4	3	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her newly - found home and make it as comforting and familiar as her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is reminiscent of her past life, often thinking about the simple joys and the close - knit community she had in Vietnam, and wishes to go back and have the life she once led in her home country. When she is feeling down about the differences between her old and new life, she finds the strength to persevere and face her challenges.
92	8954	4	3	The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story, Saeng (the girl) had been extremely stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test, constantly worrying about her future and her ability to fit in. She was also deeply saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam, which represented home and a sense of belonging. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again” (Ho), the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better about her situation. This is why the Author, @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic, and resolutive end to her story, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future.
93	8955	4	3	After Saeng fails her driver’s test, she completely gives up hope for the future, feeling dejected and useless. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation may seem. In the story, Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This quote shows how even though it’s not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the inner strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, facing language barriers and cultural differences, Saeng has proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcome if you believe in yourself and your family, and that with their support, she can achieve her goals.
94	8956	4	3	The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the test again with renewed determination. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming, a time that was full of natural beauty but also marked a moment of personal disappointment for her. By setting the time for the next attempt in relation to the natural cycle of the geese and the hibiscus, the author emphasizes the passage of time and the hope for a better outcome. It also shows that the girl is aligning her own journey with the rhythms of nature, finding inspiration and a sense of purpose in the changing seasons.
95	8957	4	3	The author concludes the end of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means to Saeng. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her, acting as a symbol of hope and resilience. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive, having gained the confidence and skills through patience and perseverance. The plant gives her hope for a new tomorrow, a new chance to prove herself. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance in her life. It makes her feel more at home in this new and sometimes confusing place, and while her home at times makes her feel like a stranger, the plant makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test, giving her a reason to look forward to the future.
96	8958	4	3	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants @DATE1 to come again. She specifically says “when the snow melts,” indicating a time of renewal. She wants to look back at the events again, perhaps to find new meaning in them, and take better care of the memories and experiences they represent.
97	8959	4	3	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she firmly knows that she will be able to pass it once she has fully accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved to the new location, she was extremely upset and deeply missed her old home, her close - knit family, and her familiar lifestyle. This emotional turmoil prevented her from concentrating on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers in her new home are also beautiful, she gradually began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her is a clear symbol that she is successfully adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn't want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's obvious disappointment and the loving kindness that followed, Saeng was strongly determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be well - prepared because she has fully adjusted to and wholeheartedly accepted her new life.
98	8960	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because in the beginning of the story, her family moved to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng was walking home from failing her driver's test. Along the way, she saw a familiar plant. Later, she decided to go to a florist shop to check if the plant could be purchased. So, she got the plant seeds and planted them. She hopes that when they start to bloom, she will go to take the driving test she failed. I believe she uses the plant for good luck. That is why I believe the author concludes that paragraph in the story.
99	8961	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng can overcome obstacles, and the next time she has these reminders of change and difficulty, she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar to her now,” this is clearly saying that she is gradually getting used to the changes in her new life. So, the end paragraph effectively reflects these ideas, highlighting Saeng's growth and adaptability.
100	8962	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome the significant change in her life and wants to make the difficult situation better. She attempts to do that by taking the test again, seeing it as a way to regain control. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and realizes that she needs to take action about it. That's why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show whether she is truly determined or not, and if she will persevere and stick through the tough times.
101	8963	4	3	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country by experiencing its various aspects. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don’t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff - hanger. I also think this is a good way to leave it off because she could write a sequel to it and make a series out of exploring the character's journey in the new country.
102	8964	4	3	The author concludes this with the story because the snow, with its soft and glistening flakes, is pretty and geese, with their graceful flight and honking calls, are animals that make the winter scene even more beautiful. So they want you to think that our outdoors, with such natural elements, is the nicest thing around.
103	8965	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” connects to her life, as it indicates that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she surely misses her old life, her beloved grandmother, the familiar well, and the fine - toothed comb, she is making an effort, and “take that test again”. By retaking the test, she shows that she is not ready to give in to “the pangs of loss” and to her grief, but rather is determined to move forward.
104	8966	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows all of this stuff going on will probably definitely come back up again. Just like how he said the geese, which are known to return every year in a regular pattern, so he is definitely saying that the issues and events in the story will come back up. That is what I firmly believe.
105	8967	4	3	I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is truly ready, both mentally and emotionally, then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, which is cold and dormant at first, the geese, which migrate and return with the changing seasons, and the hibiscus, which blossoms at the right time. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test currently and when she does get ready, when all the right conditions within her are met, then that is when she will take it.
106	8968	4	3	The author's conclusion to the story vividly shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She artfully uses a spring - time setting to signify when her confidence in herself is reborn. As the gentle spring breeze blows and nature awakens, seeing her hibiscus bud in this vibrant season will endow her with newfound integrity. With this new - found strength, she is ready to go and try that driving test again, eager to face the challenge anew.
107	8969	4	3	Hope, positivness, and helpfulness are all reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a clear sense that Saeng has hope. I distinctly felt that she had hope because despite the previous setback, she is whole - heartedly willing to take the test again. Since she is determined to take the test again, it is evident that she wants to help her mother in a more substantial way. Second, the last paragraph gave me a strong feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She carefully bought a flower to replace the dead ones, a simple yet powerful act of optimism. Moreover, she firmly stated that she will re - take the test in the spring, showing her forward - looking mindset. Third, Saeng is genuinely helpful to her mother. Saeng diligently finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, allowing her mom to go make dinner without any worry. Saeng also keenly saw the disappointment her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So, out of love and responsibility, she is re - taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything, Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful, making her a truly inspiring character.
108	8970	4	3	To her, the hibiscus was a significant test. Saeng deeply felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and whole - heartedly embracing “now.” The hibiscus, with its familiar and comforting presence, reminded her so strongly of home. As a result, she spent over @MONEY1 on it, fully aware that she and her mother needed the money. In essence, she felt as though she failed a test, a test that symbolized her ability to move forward in this new and unfamiliar place.
109	8971	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because they want you to truly understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that is that she knows inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in the cold, white snow, she will draw strength from it. So, that's when she wants to take her driving test. For example, when she said, “When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows her connection between the growth of the hibiscus and her own personal growth. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, to highlight this beautiful and meaningful connection.
110	8972	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng and her mother moved from their beloved homeland to this new place, where everything was strikingly different. She was having an extremely hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an important test. She had been deeply discouraged by this, and in an attempt to find some comfort, she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She carefully bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it, a spark of determination ignited within her. She became very determined to try and adapt, deciding to take the test when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by showing that there is hope, and a strong determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home, suggesting a promising future for her in this unfamiliar land.
111	8973	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First, the Canadian geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons “reluctantly” that they are familiar to her now. This depicts her ability to gradually adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the hibiscus is budding, and the hibiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to thrive in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the hibiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in Canada. Finally, she vows that she will take her driver's test again. Her initial failure to pass the test showed her temporary inability to become a part of Canadian society, but if she passes it, then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this story concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message, highlighting Saeng's resilience and hope for a better future in her new home.
112	8974	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a profound connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she has come to recognize the specific patterns of when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her, just as flowers typically tend to bud in the spring, symbolizing growth and renewal. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly - born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home in Vietnam and her successful adaptation to a new lifestyle in the United States.
113	8975	4	3	She will try gardening again after the geese return from their migration and the flowers start to bloom. She has a strong desire to have the best garden around, filled with a variety of colorful and fragrant plants. Gardening has been a long - standing tradition in her family, and she wants to keep this cherished tradition going, not only for herself but also to share a piece of her heritage with her new community.
114	8976	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng didn't think the winter hibiscus was still in the ground. When she got back, all of her plants were gone due to the heavy snow. This loss made her realize that setbacks are a part of life, but she refuses to be defeated. So, she said she will take that test again, meaning she will start back to the first steps of nurturing her plants and flowers. Just as she is determined to revive her garden, she is also ready to face the challenges of passing the test and moving forward in her new life.
115	8977	4	3	"The author concludes, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because Saeng doesn't want to give up yet. In the story, Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind at - at - ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. This shows that Saeng was still deeply upset because she misses her home in Vietnam. When Saeng puts the hibiscus in the ground, she feels a sense of connection and more alive. She wants to feel at home in the United States, to belong. Saeng isn't going to give up on driving; instead, she will try harder and harder to pass the test, seeing it as a crucial step towards integrating into her new life and making the United States truly feel like home."
116	8978	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's related to what she thinks. When her semblance of welcome warmed Saeng and she cheerfully said, “Cheep skip over, live to you're back! It's past time. What took you so long? Now, how did it go? Did you...”. She feels very excited as this moment is related to her emotions and the overall mood of the situation. It ties in well with the story's atmosphere and the character's feelings.
117	8979	4	3	“When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is gently budding, then I will take that test again.” The story “Winter Hibiscus” ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she currently lives, and now this home has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story, her mother says, “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” Saeng is the winter hibiscus that's strong enough to make it through winter, and failing the test won't matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That's represented when the hibiscus is in full bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng's feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It's also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work hard to pass it in the spring, thus achieving her goal.
118	8980	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because the hibiscus makes them overcome obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can prove to her mum that she can pass it. I also think that because the hibiscus gives them strength and she gained more confidence in herself to pass the test, which will be a significant step for her to move forward in life.
119	8981	4	3	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons are that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and there will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and gives the reader the happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistence is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow gradually melting, the geese steadily returning and the flower slowly blooming which are things that happen constantly and hardly stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistence which is vital in life, leaving a profound impression on the reader.
120	8982	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do things in the spring when she sees flowers growing vividly because she feels like she is truly at home, so she feels more confident about passing the test, which will be a new beginning for her.
121	8983	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the poignant quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the gentle snow melts and the geese gracefully return and this delicate hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author put this paragraph as the concluding thought to strongly stress that Saeng is firmly determined to make a change. She unfortunately failed the test but is eager to take it again. Her beloved grandmother's resemblance is beautifully captured in the flower, so if the flower buds, then in a profound sense, her grandmother will be back. When her grandmother ""comes back"", then Saeng will feel as if her grandmother is tenderly giving her the strength and encouragement she needs to bravely try the test again."
122	8984	4	3	The author ends with that carefully - crafted paragraph to vividly show how Saeng, much like the budding and resilient Hibiscus, will get a brand - new start in the refreshing spring and successfully overcome the various obstacles that stand in her way, emerging stronger and more determined.
123	8985	4	3	"The author concludes the story with, ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the pleasant spring, when the soft snows melt and the geese return in formation and this lovely hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think the author used that conclusion to subtly make the reader eager to finish the story on their own, creating a sense of engagement. Or he could write another story to neatly finish it. Most authors conclude their stories like this so that the reader is truly in control about the ending, allowing for a personalized and immersive experience."
124	8986	4	3	Based on my in - depth understanding of the story, I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to strongly emphasize what will happen as well as to gently lead the reader to start thinking, building the excitement and planting questions as well as thoughts in the head after reading the passage. For me, it's a way to capture the reader's attention as they wonder whether she can survive and is able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not accustomed to. It also serves to test her ability to see if she will be able to endure the different types of seasons and to make the reader realize that no matter what you face in life, there are always more obstacles ahead of you, teaching a valuable life lesson.
125	8987	4	3	The author chose to end the story with that paragraph for deep - seated emotional meanings. The last paragraph is clearly saying she will re - take the test when the hibiscus is gloriously blooming in the warm spring. She sincerely hopes that the sight of the blooming hibiscus will infuse her with the strength to pass the test. The hibiscus, with its rich symbolism, reminds her of her cherished homeland and offers her a great deal of comfort. Saeng earnestly hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will vividly remind her of her home and endow her with the strength to successfully pass the test, giving her the courage to face the future.
126	8988	4	3	The author ends the story in this way because the planting and leaving of the geese signify change to Saeng. The hibiscus she sees isn't the same as the one she remembers from her home country. The budding of the hibiscus reflects Saeng's sense of happiness associated with home. This paragraph shows that the familiarity of the budding plant gives Saeng the courage and the ability to overcome the obstacle she faces. The geese in this paragraph represent the passage of time. The plant will bud at the time when the geese return in the spring. If the author hadn't included this final paragraph, the full impact of memories for Saeng wouldn't have been fully depicted. This line implies that Saeng was initially unable to overcome her obstacle due to the newness of this place. However, when the buds bring her a sense of home, she will be able to defeat the obstacle of her driving test and become more confident.
127	8989	4	3	The author includes that part because it shows that she is not giving up. Since she is not giving up, she can have more attempts at achieving her goal, which will increase her chances of success in the end.
128	8990	4	3	"There are many reasons why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness as seen in the fact that ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test"". This quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failed a very important test and she is walking alone. ""She sees a familiar plant"" is when the hope starts to return to the story. When she brings the plant she had purchased here to her mother, the significance is also highlighted. ""Where did you get it?"" her mother asked, and Saeng replied ""I bought it."" She bought it for @MONEY1 more than what her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on, it was clear to her mother that the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter. I remember a time when my mother bought me a scented - candle cat decoration. I felt it was a waste of money, but when I saw her light it with delight, I grew to love it as well. When Saeng's mother realized that the plant made Saeng happy and gave her the courage to take the driver's test again, it became evident why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again."
129	8991	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story a bit longer and it gives it a good, satisfying ending. However, I have no idea what that particular part means. So, it would be better if the author explained what it means instead of leaving the readers to figure it out on their own.
130	8992	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was trying to let us know what happened after the story was done. The author also tried to make it clear and straightforward. That's why I think that @CAPS1 came up with the idea to conclude the story with that paragraph, so as to provide a sense of closure to the readers.
131	8993	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is patiently going to wait until the harsh winter is completely over so that she can have a truly fresh beginning. She earnestly wants to try again because the last time she carelessly messed up and accidentally tilled the plants. Saeng has a deep - seated desire to become a gardener just like her mother.
132	8994	4	3	The author of this well - crafted essay deliberately includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it clear that she will gradually realize that they are steadily coming back.
133	8995	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to vividly show that Saeng got notably stronger. She got stronger because she gradually adjusted to her new home and the unfamiliar new environment. Saeng is now much more confident in herself to take the test again. She firmly doesn't want to cry again, just like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the fundamental reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because her new - found strength gives her the courage.
134	8996	4	3	Confidence, persistence, memories – all essential things that Saeng has, which helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph. Since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy; she was upset pretty much the whole time and deeply misses everyone and everything from Vietnam. Everything she sees reminds her of it. That last paragraph, where it clearly says, “then I will take that test again,” strongly shows that she has confidence in herself and whole - heartedly wants to try harder next time. She shows unfailing persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won't give up. Saeng misses almost everything from Vietnam, even the delicious food. She also misses her dear family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably holding her back from concentrating hard on her driver's test. She knew she wanted to do well, so she bought the flower in the hopeful belief that it would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng's life will get better in the United States and she will learn to whole - heartedly love this country.
135	8997	4	3	Because with the beautiful blooming of the hibiscus plant comes a glimmer of new hope. In the story, she clearly sees the hibiscus as a symbol of her old life, and with the gentle budding of the plant, it gracefully starts a brand - new chapter in the young girl's life, filled with possibilities.
136	8998	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he's trying to prove his point effectively. I think that Saeng was carefully comparing herself to the flower. For example, the flower was originally a wild flower growing freely in nature, and then it was planted in a pot, restricting its natural growth. Saeng was a free and happy girl, full of life and joy, but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place in their new circumstances. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower, then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the harsh winter, with all its cold and snow, then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across clearly.
137	8999	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to vividly show that Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author aims to leave Saeng on a positive and good - natured note so she won't be sad and discouraged. When she takes the test again, she'll be better prepared, having learned from her previous mistakes, and know exactly what she's expecting. She'll have a more comfortable and hopeful winter, filled with anticipation and self - confidence.
138	9000	4	3	I think the author concludes the story as he or she did to teach a valuable lesson. No matter what obstacles stand in your way, be it difficult people or tough situations, or no matter what slows you down, like a lack of resources or time, never give up your dreams and efforts. You should keep on trying persistently, with unwavering determination. If you fail something, try again and again until you get it right, and eventually achieve your goal.
139	9001	4	3	@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1 – All are significant reasons why the author concludes the story with this “When They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take the test again.” First, @CAPS2 because she failed her test first, and it takes a great deal of courage and will power to go back and even attempt it again. Also, because when she remembers her grandmother it upsets her deeply, so that definitely takes @CAPS2 and strong human will power to do her test a second time. Next, memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many wonderful and precious memories with her grandmother and doesn't want to ever forget them. But again, it goes back to the will power or the desire to go back and do the test a second time. Last, all the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother meant to her and through all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out, she saw and wants to honor or appreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph.
140	9002	4	3	The author includes the last paragraph to show that she still has a glimmer of hope. It is the last sentence because @CAPS1 fong Ho wants to vividly show that when all seems lost and you're at the end of your rope, feeling hopeless and dejected, you can always hope for the better. When spring comes, with its warm sunshine and blooming flowers, so will a new beginning, not only for Saeng's plant, which will start to grow and thrive again, but also for her life in a different country, filled with new opportunities and possibilities.
141	9003	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. “Saeng vowed silently to herself” clearly tells the audience that Saeng is making a sincere effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a powerful way to show that Saeng is whole - heartedly willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She firmly says, “I will take that test again”. The test represents the various obstacles she will overcome when efforts are applied. The hibiscus in the sentence “…when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” symbolizes starting over. The budding hibiscus is vividly compared to Saeng with a fresh start and the strong determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to effectively highlight the theme and symbolize a new start.
142	9004	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then easily compare Saeng and the hibiscus. After carefully reading that statement, I clearly realized Saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus budding). Perhaps the author might have ended the story with that statement because it clearly shows that Saeng is deeply committed to working toward her goal and won't give up. “Saeng vowed silently to herself, ‘I will take that test again’”. Finally, I think the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to Saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in as they want. For example, I know Saeng is going to take the test again and I firmly believe she will pass it, however, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.
143	9005	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the winter and then gracefully come back in the spring. In a similar way, the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the driver's test again in the spring with renewed determination. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, which clearly shows that winter is its weakness. Just like the hibiscus, the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by deeply remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so that the reader can clearly see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus, resilient and ready for a new beginning.
144	9006	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it clearly shows she will mature. She is honestly saying that she was not fully ready for all the challenges she was going to face. For example, she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it, she calmly just said “I will take it again next year”. This shows her strong - willed nature. In the story, she also deeply longed for her homeland, which she truly missed. She coped with this longing by carefully buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her dear grandmother. Overall, the main character showed remarkable depth and maturity throughout the piece.
145	9007	4	3	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it effectively shows Saeng’s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, which might be very different from what she is used to, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming harsh winter. Saeng vows to herself, “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” From this heartfelt vow, you can clearly tell that Saeng has high hopes for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her new home. She says of the hibiscus, “it’s not like the kind we had before”. But she gradually realized that the hibiscus could be a precious reminder of home as well as a reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could surely survive living somewhere new.
146	9008	4	3	The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the driving test again, come springtime. This is because Saeng is having a tough time adapting to her new home. She understands that fitting in won't be easy, and she won't give up after just one failure. Remembering her past home and the fact that she will never be able to return are painful thoughts for Saeng. However, memories of it help her cope with the sense of loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found in her new surroundings comforted her greatly, as they vividly reminded her of home. At springtime, when the geese return from their winter migration and the hibiscus starts blooming beautifully, Saeng will feel ready once again to take the test. The spring season represents the chance for another try and a brand - new beginning, which gives her the motivation to persevere.
147	9009	4	3	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph for a specific reason. The closing sentence informs the reader that Saeng will take the test again. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng tells her mother that she failed the test. By the time spring arrives, the hibiscus will start budding, a sign of new life. This is when Saeng will retake the test. Also, the geese left their home temporarily because of the heavy snow. Saeng sort of compares herself to the geese as she misses her home deeply. The geese will return when the time is right, just as Saeng will attempt the test again when the conditions are favorable. This is what the author concludes in the story's last paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and renewal.
148	9010	4	3	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant, specifically the hibiscus, represents being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng good luck for her next driving test after the harsh winter season. When winter fades away and the hibiscus starts budding, it symbolizes new opportunities. Also, the reason why the author ended the story with this sentence is to show Saeng's plan for the future. She is waiting for the right time, marked by the blooming of the hibiscus, to take on the test again with renewed hope and determination.
149	9011	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. This paragraph clearly shows that Saeng will not give up easily. She will patiently wait for the next time to come around to take the driving test. It also implies that she will be well - prepared. She will have built up a good amount of confidence in passing this test. It gives the reader a strong idea that Saeng has a never - say - die attitude and will complete the test successfully. Her mother will be extremely proud of her when she does. Just like when she said “let’s plant it, right now,” this example shows that even though Saeng had failed the test and disappointed her mother, she remains resolute. She still has hope in the plant, just as her mother has hope for Saeng's future.
150	9012	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently to herself. She was deeply lost in thought, thinking about what had happened a long time ago with her mom and the plants in her garden. Saeng was imagining how things would be when everything comes back with the return of Spring. She wondered how it would be when the thick snow melts away, when the geese return from their long journey, and when the world around her comes back to life. She vowed silently to herself that she will take the test again. This is how I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of Saeng's inner strength and determination.
151	9013	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story, it is about a @PERSON1, a young girl and her caring mother. The girl is given some money to buy plant seeds. She carefully spends @MONEY1 on this particular plant. Her mother initially gets upset, but then everything turns around. Like they had delicious egg omlets with sweet bits of melon, and they all ended up having a pleasant time.
152	9014	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to vividly show that after all the events that took place, Saeng will bravely move on and put in great effort. For example, when she firmly said, “When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” By ending the story in such a way, it effectively leaves the reader in suspense because they are uncertain if the geese will actually return. The author seems to be subtly showing the reader that Saeng is gradually starting to adapt to her new country and make it feel like her old one. For example, when the mother tenderly said, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This clearly shows that they wish their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will surely be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to clearly demonstrate how she will successfully adapt to the change in her environment.
153	9015	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can hardly wait until spring as her plant will bud and it will vividly remind her of her homeland again. She is extremely eager to take the test in spring because she would have been able to stay and she @MONTH1 hopes to pass the test in the spring since she did not pass it the first time she took the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 truly likes the spring and she can hardly contain her excitement for it to come. By ending on this note, it emphasizes her anticipation and the hope she has for a better outcome in the spring.
154	9016	4	3	I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more comfortable and fully ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by patiently waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself sufficient time to thoroughly prepare. Also, she is eagerly waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. Something I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of comfort. The whole story revolves around how Saeng was able to comfort herself by fondly reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, she can become truly comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to strongly stress the importance of this flower in how Saeng lives her life, as it serves as a symbol of hope and comfort.
155	9017	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly show she has hope. She firmly believes that she can pass the test when everything returns to normal, specifically in the spring. In the spring, the geese will gracefully return and the hibiscus will be beautifully budding. This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved. Also, she genuinely likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more at ease and comfortable. This is precisely why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to powerfully show that she has hope, and it leaves the reader with a sense of optimism for her future.
156	9018	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he/she wanted to draw a comparison between Saeng's life and that of the plant. For instance, in the story, Saeng had just failed her driving test. Right after this set - back, she saw a plant that instantly reminded her of her homeland. As she carried the plant from the flower shop to her house, she constantly compared her homeland to the flower, clearly showing how deeply she related to it. So, the concluding paragraph indicates that just as the hibiscus is budding and entering a new phase, Saeng will also embark on a new journey and go for her driver's license once again.
157	9019	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show Saeng's determination to adapt to the significant change in her life. In the story, Saeng fails her driver's test and is truly struggling to adjust to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, when she notices that the hibiscus and geese are familiar sights, she becomes firmly determined to adapt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it strongly reminds her of home. This purchase not only comforts her but also makes her miss her old home even more. The hibiscus has the remarkable ability to survive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, which helps Saeng realize that she too can thrive in this new environment. The author includes the geese because they play a crucial role in helping Saeng understand that she is becoming more familiar with things in the United States. Saeng remarks that she now easily recognizes the “V” shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accustomed to @LOCATION1 and that she is capable of surviving here gives her the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes these elements to effectively summarize the story's theme of adapting to change.
158	9020	4	3	I think that the author deliberately put that sentence in the text to establish a more personal connection with the character. By doing so, the readers can more easily relate to that person on a deeper emotional level. This way, the story becomes more engaging and relatable, allowing the audience to better understand the character's experiences and feelings.
159	9021	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the importance of new beginnings and to strongly accentuate the theme in the story. The central theme is that one must have the courage to overcome hardships and actively seek new beginnings. Springtime is a well - known symbol of a new beginning. So, the arrival of spring will offer her an opportunity to start afresh on the driver's test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to highlight the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just as the hibiscus brought back memories of her home life, the geese will serve as a reminder of the hope and renewal that springtime represents. This all ties together to reinforce the story's message about new beginnings.
160	9022	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it is a powerful way of suggesting that Saeng is going to put aside what happened in the past when she failed her test and is going to perform better the next time. It's as if the author is saying that Saeng will be reborn again, much like the hibiscus when spring arrives. Throughout the story, Saeng had to make adjustments, just as the hibiscus had to adapt to its new surroundings. The hibiscus served as a great source of inspiration for Saeng, motivating her to do well in her new environment. So, after learning so much from the hibiscus, it marks a brand - new beginning for Saeng."
161	9023	4	3	Itís kind of like a central theme for the story. The hibiscuses, with their vibrant colors and unique shapes, inspire her to want to actively engage in various things. I guess they bring vivid memories of her home country, with its familiar landscapes and warm - hearted people, and make her eager to bravely try new things. This is significant to the story because it clearly shows you how incredibly important the hibiscus was to Saeng, serving as a powerful symbol of her connection to the past and her motivation for the future.
162	9024	4	3	I think the author chose to end the story this way to vividly show that the girl is deeply remembering her past and is truly at ease. With the flower in her presence, she attains a profound sense of peace. The writer wants to effectively convey that no matter what kind of environment or lifestyle you are accustomed to, you can surely find something, like this flower, that can bring you genuine happiness and a strong sense of focus, guiding you through life's ups and downs.
163	9025	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 as it clearly shows that she is determined to pass that test. She has set her mind firmly on it and is not going to give up even a little bit until she finally passes it. This determination is a key aspect of the character's development in the story, highlighting her perseverance and will - power.
164	9026	4	3	The reason why I feel the author ended the story with this paragraph is because she is skillfully showing how the character has matured and how the character has grown within her difficult circumstances. This clearly shows that just because you failed once doesnít mean you are going to fail again. Also, itís perfectly okay to feel out of place at times. There is always going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start. So it is entirely your choice to take that chance bravely or be stuck in your own old ways. But ultimately, the decision is always up to you, and this ending encourages us to be brave and embrace new beginnings.
165	9027	4	3	In the short story ìWinter Hibiscusî by ìMinfong Hoî she ends the story by saying, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ìI - I failed the testî. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is extremely upset about it. Nobody wants to fail at something, and it is almost a deeply humiliating experience to have failed at a test, especially knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a clear sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to vividly show that they are ready to ìstart overî again or to ìtry againî. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to ìstart lifeî again. Saeng seeing these objects doing things over and over again empowers her strongly to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a natural part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward with determination and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and unwavering commitment, and that that is what makes a truly great, strong individual, capable of overcoming life's challenges.
166	9028	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because he wants to let the reader know that the situation is not over. He wants the reader to understand that @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget the events and circumstances. And also that all these events will happen again, creating a sense of cyclicality and persistence in the narrative.
167	9029	4	3	The author concludes the ending as “I will take that test again” meaning that the difficulties she is going through now are going to happen again, but next time she will be prepared. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the new place. Her mother supports her as she goes through the winter. The hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represents more than itself. In this text of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the hibiscus she bought when she was in a worst time accompanied her through the winter. At the last paragraph of the story, she expresses “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. She is thinking of the future and how she, Saeng, vowed silently to herself in the spring. She can't wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come, looking forward to a new start.
168	9030	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants with dedication. When she gets back, she wants the snow to melt and for everything to return to life. That is what the author is clearly telling me from the story, showing a connection between the character's actions and the changing of seasons.
169	9031	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will stay again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life, there will always be something or someone there to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sense of similarity to the character, meaning no matter how out of place you feel, there is always something you can relate to, creating an empathetic bond between the reader and the story.
170	9032	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so that we will buy his coming book, or so that we get more excited about what is to come. By ending the story in this way, the author aims to leave the readers with a sense of anticipation and eagerness to explore more of his literary works, effectively creating a hook for future engagement.
171	9033	4	3	"In this story, the author decides to end the story with this paragraph: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This is because she wants to take the test when everything is ideal. For example, she wants everything she likes in her environment, such as the blooming flowers, the flying geese, and the pleasant weather. Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragraph is that she wants to be in an environment like the one in her home country. For instance, there was no snow and it was like springtime all year around. This is why I say that the author ended the story with that paragraph, as it reflects Saeng's longing for a familiar and comforting setting for the test."
172	9034	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is deeply comforted by the memories of her homeland and truly appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She firmly believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, she cannot pass the test until it is. ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of before had, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost become familiar to her now."" This clearly shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants. She is thinking back to other times when things were strange during the winter and better in the spring and other seasons when the plants are budding. So, she believes that she will actually pass the driver's test when she feels comfortable, when the plants have budded and the environment is more like that of her homeland."
173	9035	4	3	The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal and familiar things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to clearly show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was accustomed to. Saeng specifically wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more at ease and comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the U.S. The hibiscus gives her that comforting feeling as if she is home again, in Vietnam. Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be exactly how they were. The plants in the greenhouse along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second - to - last paragraph, the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the V - formation of the geese. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says that when Saeng arrived in the new place, she had nothing that was familiar to her. Now she gets that feeling of familiarity from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do and how she is waiting for a more comforting time to face the test again.
174	9036	4	3	"I think the author concludes with the sentence ""Then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back, it will be spring, and the school will likely reopen. So, it will be an appropriate time to go back to school and also take the test. Saeng wants to take the test in a more favorable and familiar environment. The presence of the geese and the budding hibiscus will give her the comfort and confidence she needs. This is why the author's conclusion makes sense as it ties in Saeng's longing for a better testing situation with the natural cycle of the seasons."
175	9037	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes his story with an odd ending. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again."" Beyond the literal meaning, the author is showing how Saeng is gradually adapting to the new country. By failing her driver's test, she also faced a setback in adapting and accepting the new country. However, by vowing to try again, it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. ""She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home."" This clearly shows that she still didn't consider this country her home. She was still deeply stuck on her past and the memories of her homeland. The author's ending implies that Saeng is on a journey of adaptation, and waiting for the spring to take the test again is a symbol of her hope for a better outcome and a more comfortable integration into the new environment."
176	9038	4	3	The author concludes this story in the paragraph to clearly show that Saeng won't stop her pursuit, just because she failed that one time at the beginning. It also vividly shows that she is not going to let certain difficulties and setbacks keep her down, and will continue to strive forward.
177	9039	4	3	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningful part. I firmly believe the author ended the story this way for many well - thought - out reasons. For example, I think the author did this specifically to leave the reader with a strong and lasting sense of determination. The story quotes, “I will take that test again.” By the deliberate use of the word “will”, the author powerfully shows the girl's unwavering determination. She didn't say she would try to, she said she will, without a single doubt. I also think the author ended this way to strongly emphasize the theme of new beginnings. The story quotes, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again.” This clearly shows that in spring, the new beginning of life, she will take the test. This is precisely why I believe the author ended the story this way.
178	9040	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a very good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph subtly hints to the reader that Saeng intends to skillfully combine her new and old lives. Her old life is vividly represented by the hibiscus; she is accustomed to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have gradually become “almost familiar to her now”. The significant obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng's life are well - combined, Saeng will be fully able to overcome her “obstacle”, and all will be in a harmonious and positive state. With the geese on the ground, Saeng's life will have truly come full circle.
179	9041	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's very important when she says “when geese return and this hibiscus is budding” and then she says she will take that test again. This is to clearly tell the reader exactly when she will take that test again. That's the exact reason why it's included in the story.
180	9042	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it strongly emphasizes that Saeng is whole - heartedly willing to retake the test when the right time comes back. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the second - last paragraph says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of the season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This sentence clearly shows me that Saeng is gradually getting used to the new place. Also, it shows how she is changing her mind about the plant and the fact that even though it's not the same as what she's used to, it can still hold special meaning. Therefore, I think the author made an excellent choice in ending the story with this paragraph.
181	9043	4	3	The last paragraph states “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to clearly state the fact that when her new home starts to resemble her old home in terms of the natural scenery and the changing seasons, maybe she will feel more confident and more at ease in her new place. This is in contrast to the cold winter, which is the total opposite of the climate and environment where she used to live. The feeling of having elements of her old home in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then, she will take the test feeling like she is at home and is likely to pass it, demonstrating her successful adaptation to the new environment.
182	9044	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author vividly expresses how the girl believes that with her cherished memories and once she gradually changes and fully adapts to the new culture, that's when she will have the courage to retake the test she failed on that particular day. Saeng misses her home so much that she can't initially grasp that there are indeed similarities between her new home and her old one. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng didn't want to expect the move at first, but as she notices that she won't forget any of her old memories, she starts to embrace new memories. At first, everything was so different, but now she is starting to recall things about her new home, which is a clear sign of comfort to her. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” With Saeng's complex feelings about the change, the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is definite hope for her to move on in her new home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows that when she does, she can take her test and succeed at it. The author effectively shows how good change can be if one is willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be, but your courage will help you create a happy home filled with both new and old memories, as Saeng starts to realize during the last paragraph, highlighting the power of resilience and adaptation.
183	9045	4	3	The author merely states the obvious within this short story. This excerpt mainly means that when spring arrives with its warm weather and blooming flowers, she will return to the greenhouse or the area filled with all the plants. When she gets there, the girl will attempt to find the plant that grows wild in her home country and bring it to her new home, perhaps as a way to connect with her roots and bring a piece of her past into her new life. This action also shows her longing for her homeland and her desire to create a more familiar environment in her new place.
184	9046	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he's trying to vividly show Saeng as the type of person who never gives up and always keeps growing, just like the resilient hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she once thought were strange before have, through the quiet and continuous repetition of season upon season, become almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have the next season when the plant has fully grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again. This indicates that she has accepted the passage of time and the changes in her new environment, and is looking forward to new opportunities and growth, just like the cycle of nature.
185	9047	4	3	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively shows how Saeng feels. In the paragraph, Saeng said ""I will take that test again"", which means she is contemplating whether she will go through the same difficult experiences again. This shows her determination and her willingness to face challenges. It also reflects her growth and self - awareness as she tries to figure out if she has the strength and ability to overcome the same obstacles in the future. Through this statement, the author allows the reader to understand Saeng's evolving mindset and her journey of adaptation in the new environment."
186	9048	4	3	The author ends the story this way to clearly show that there can always be a heart - warming happy ending. The geese gracefully came back to the familiar place, and the girl was extremely happy because of their return. This happy ending leaves a positive impression on the readers.
187	9049	4	3	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all the precious things that she isn't going to give up on. She is earnestly trying to say that when everything she whole - heartedly believes in succeeds, that's precisely when she is going to take her driving test. Her mother gently says that the flower is never going to give up and it's strong enough to bravely live through the harsh winter. The geese are going to always come back year after year. That is exactly what she is going to do with her test. She is not going to give up on the test; she is going to keep trying patiently until she finally passes.
188	9050	4	3	Saeng feels more comfortable and at ease in the spring because it vividly reminds her of her beloved home. She probably never had the experience of seeing snow or going through a cold winter before. So nothing in this cold time of the year can evoke memories of home for her. In the spring, it does because the geese return in a beautiful formation and the hibiscus grow again, making everything around her feel like it's her home again. Confidence is what she receives when spring comes again, giving her a sense of belonging and strength.
189	9051	4	3	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph because it precisely sums up everything the hibiscus has selflessly given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place and lost in this new country, and the hibiscus helps her clearly realize the importance in adapting to her new environment for her survival in order to live happily. She can't always be stuck dwelling in the past but has to learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the new ways, like learning to drive, and embracing her new life.
190	9052	4	3	I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” used this for the last paragraph because it is subtly saying when she sees that hibiscus, it will bring back sweet memories of home again, which will bring much - needed encouragement for the test. “The geese symbolize Saeng's firm determination to pass the test and adapt to the new country. Saeng explains, “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V - shape was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” This quote creates a vivid and powerful image in my mind that clearly lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also, showing her strong will to move forward.
191	9053	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it is, in a subtle yet impactful way, letting you know that everything's going to be alright. Saeng, who has faced the disappointment of a failed drivers test, is going to retry her drivers test again with newfound determination. Everything is back to the way she likes best, with a sense of normalcy and hope restored. It gives you a strong sense of hope, assuring you that everything is going to be alright with her. Also, it indicates that she is going to start making the best out of life, seizing every opportunity that comes her way. I believe it's saying this, and that is why I think the author concludes with that paragraph, leaving the readers with a feeling of optimism.
192	9054	4	3	The Author uses this paragraph to conclude the Story because it clearly shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this new country. She is already beginning to understand it and like it, gradually finding her place in this unfamiliar land. When it says “and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, it is a powerful metaphor about herself. When the hibiscus begins to bloom and flourish, just as she is starting to bloom and grow into a more confident and capable individual. This is why the Author ended with this passage, as it beautifully encapsulates Saeng's journey of adaptation and growth.
193	9055	4	3	Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant, she just does not feel mentally and emotionally ready to take the test. She doesn't have the motivation because the plant was with her throughout her whole life, serving as a constant source of comfort and familiarity. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant by her side. Saeng means that since she's had a plant like that her whole life, then she subconsciously thinks she needs it for support. But I don't think she really needs it in a practical sense. I guess it just “comforts” her, providing a psychological boost.
194	9056	4	3	The author didn't think that Saeng was ready to take the test until she knew more about it. Saeng had a lot on her mind regarding gardening, as she was deeply passionate about it. Since she didn't have any friends in school, she didn't want to go there as she would have nobody to talk to, which added to her lack of enthusiasm for the test. It's good that Saeng vowed to take the test again because she will never know if she would do good or bad without giving it a try. So, the author realized that Saeng will take the test and pass, as her determination and growing knowledge will likely lead to success.
195	9057	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memories of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to the fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back, there will be a flood of memories coming back to her. During spring, animals come out of their hiding places and trees blossom, creating a beautiful and enchanting scenery. It makes it all beautiful for her to take the test again, with the support from her memories of her country, which will give her the strength and motivation to succeed. The author uses this ending to tie together Saeng's past and present, and to leave a lasting impression of hope and connection.
196	9058	4	3	After reading the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in a unique way that clearly demonstrates a will to survive. For example, in the text, the author writes and explains how the plant “dok faeng - noi” has adapted to its cold environment, which is different from the ones back at home. This showcases the idea of survival as, in the past, this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time. But when the cold set in, it found ways to change itself and adapt, all driven by the instinct to survive. Another example in the text is the author having Saeng tell herself that in the spring, when the weather is more favorable and the world is full of new beginnings, she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test, she felt a deep sense of melancholy and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how, as a human being, she wants to live. And for her to live in a new country, she must adapt by passing that test to become a survivor. In conclusion, the author's unique ending effectively conveys the powerful theme of the will to survive.
197	9059	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show the story about snows covering the roads. He shows people the importance of carefully watching where they are going on these snow - covered roads. In conclusion, the paragraph would show that he made it through the snow storm, highlighting his perseverance and ability to overcome the challenging situation presented by the snow. This ending not only gives a sense of resolution but also emphasizes the significance of being cautious in difficult circumstances.
198	9060	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng vows to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return in a beautiful V - formation, and the hibiscus is budding with delicate flowers, then she will take the test again. The author concludes with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her a sense of comfort from home and boosts her confidence. “Almost familiar to her now.” This quote from the story shows that things are starting to fall into place and she is starting to feel at ease, making her realize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus, it brings back memories of the flowers that they used to have in their old home. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story, the mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclusion, the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the girl's memory of where she used to live, and how it provides her with the strength to face new challenges.
199	9061	4	3	The author chooses this end to clearly show that Saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown deeply, and has many feelings and vivid memories from back then, she faced a tough situation. She had taken the test and failed, and living where she was living then just seemed to bring too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted thoroughly, she will try her best to overcome the situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader with the image of her buying a flower after failing a test and simply moving on with her life. For example, when she failed the test, she seemed extremely distressed and very angry. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng said. For a long moment, Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. It angered Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge, extreme emotional situations occur. Saeng just needed hope, and the author chose this ending to convey to the reader that there is a chance of hope. In conclusion, the author's choice of ending effectively instills hope in the reader and shows Saeng's indomitable spirit.
200	9062	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author Minfong Ho ends the story as she does for many cogent reasons. These reasons are likely intertwined with the themes and character development within the story. Perhaps the ending is designed to leave the reader with a sense of hope, or to emphasize the character's growth and resilience. It could also be a way to tie up loose ends and provide a satisfying conclusion to the narrative. Whatever the reasons, the author's choice of ending plays a crucial role in shaping the overall impact of the story. In conclusion, the author's ending is a carefully crafted element that contributes significantly to the story's meaning and resonance.
201	9063	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it neatly wraps up the entire narrative and sums it all into one concise thought. It is clearly explaining that she is eagerly looking forward to the spring season when the hibiscus is in full bloom.
202	9064	4	3	"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is because she's making the statement that the birds have a place where they live all the time, and the plant can thrive here. Just as they can survive and adapt, she's saying that she can too if she tries. So, she will patiently wait till the birds come back and are settled, and the plant buds, signifying a new beginning in her new home. When everything is okay, she will be able to take the test because she understands and firmly believes that she will feel safer and a lot better."
203	9065	4	3	The story ends like this for several reasons. First of all, the author ended the story in this way to make the readers deeply think about what will happen if there is a part two. By leaving the story open - ended, it sparks the readers' imagination and curiosity. Secondly, ending the story like this gives the author the opportunity to create a part two. That is why he ended the story in such a manner.
204	9066	4	3	She vowed this because just as the geese would return to their familiar place, she too shall return. Also, just as the geese test themselves to learn and grow during their arduous journey, she would do the same. Furthermore, when she faces the tests of love, survival, and family tradition, she would know that coming back was her destiny. For example, the geese come to raise their young for the challenging journey that they shall face. This helps them to realize that they always will come back because their lives started there, and they need to escape the cold and the threat of mankind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are extremely harsh there, so they know that they have to leave just to survive. She learns valuable lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival from observing the geese.
205	9067	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a firm commitment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because in life, there's always a next time for everything. Most importantly, the reason he said it was to constantly remind himself that there's always another opportunity to try. Finally, it's crucial that most people should know that everyone gets a second chance in life, and this conclusion serves as a gentle reminder of that.
206	9068	4	3	The author concludes the story in this way because the seasons are gradually changing, and they are finishing their natural cycle and commencing a new one. This natural process of transition provides a fitting backdrop for the story's end. Thus, I think this is a good way to end a story like this because it kind of sets a reflective mood and a poignant feel at the conclusion of the narrative, leaving the reader with a sense of closure and the understanding that life, like the seasons, is ever - changing.
207	9069	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because it effectively conveys the central theme of the story, which is adjusting to changes in life. So many aspects of life have changed for Saeng, and she has not fully adjusted yet to this new way of life. However, she gradually learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive, just like the hibiscus. The text states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding”. The hibiscus serves as a powerful symbol that teaches Saeng to never give up. Just as the hibiscus doesn't give up and manages to survive during the harsh winter, Saeng realizes she can do the same. Even though she failed the driving test the first time, her memories have provided her with strength and support. She is now going to try again with renewed determination. These ideas are included in the last paragraph because they neatly summarize the overarching idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly acclimated to this new place and now recognizes the changing seasons as she contemplates this last thought, signifying her growth and acceptance.
208	9070	4	3	To set a specific tone and to vividly describe how they look, that little paragraph serves multiple purposes. It can also act as a springboard to start another book or to pique your interest in studying various things. Moreover, it could draw a comparison between your life and the geese's life. For example, it could involve explaining the hardships you have endured, much like the geese face challenges in their migratory journey. This comparison allows you to gain a new perspective on your own struggles and resilience.
209	9071	4	3	The author chooses to end this story like this for many well - thought - out reasons. Throughout the story, the author subtly gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He skillfully relates this sense of longing to the flower being strong enough to survive the cold winter months. This implies that just as the flower endures the harsh conditions, Saeng will also survive the difficulties of being in a new place. Although the flower is not the same as the ones she had at home, change is an inevitable part of life, and at least she can hold on to the symbol of the flower's resilience. So, I believe the author decides to end the story with this to convey that just like the plant, Saeng will survive and attempt to adjust in the spring, similar to how she will try again for her driving test, showing her growth and determination.
210	9072	4	3	The author concluded like that because he was the one responsible for scoring the lines below what you write. By doing so, he aimed to score to a certain level and make the key points clearer. In all the things he was involved with, he was surprisingly kind enough to separate the elements appropriately. Through this separation, he hoped to give one a high sense of the overall content. It was as if he wanted to sweeten all the details up to the very end of the author's conclusion, ensuring that the final part of the work left a lasting and positive impression.
211	9073	4	3	"I believe that the author included this paragraph to clearly show that she didn't give up easily. It was to illustrate that after facing failure in the test, as Saeng said to her mother ""I failed the test"", she still kept trying. Moreover, it was also intended to make her sound proud and genuinely happy about the prospect of trying the test over again. I, too, have experienced failing tests. I also said that I would take them over, but unfortunately, I didn't follow through. So, the author put that in there to show just how determined she was going to come across. This shows the stark contrast between her resolve and my lack of follow - through, highlighting her admirable quality of perseverance."
212	9074	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly lets the reader know that there is still a real chance for Saeng. She is not giving up on herself or the test. While carefully reading the story, you will notice that Saeng is deeply comforted by memories of her homeland. Evidently, this move to another country was extremely hard on her. In the story, the author writes, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.” The distinct feeling and sweet scent of the hibiscus flower provided her with much - needed comfort. After failing the test, she then decided to purchase the plant as she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once “this hibiscus plant is budding, then I will take that test again” because, as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive and significant aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her the strong motivation to once again take the driver’s test, and it is also clearly letting the reader know that Saeng is firmly not giving up on her goal.
213	9075	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a strong and impactful paragraph to vividly show the passion and unwavering will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences state that Saeng “vowed” to pass the test, it powerfully shows her determination to fight against all odds. This strong will could be stemming from the warm memories of her grandmother and the beautiful flowers that so closely reminded her of her old home. Saeng's remarkable courage to face her homesickness is truly the very seed of the story. By ending it with such a bold and inspiring statement, Minfong Ho transforms this seemingly sad tale into a powerful story of willpower and the strong drive to pass her test. “Winter Hibiscus” is a passage filled with heartache, despair, and a deep yearning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho effectively puts a happy and hopeful ending to a possibly sad tale, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about Saeng's future.
214	9076	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because the season is gradually coming to an end, and in a parallel way, the story is also reaching its natural conclusion. Just as the changing season marks the end of a cycle in nature, the events in the story have reached a point where it makes sense to wrap things up. This way, the conclusion of the story aligns with the natural progression of the season, creating a harmonious and fitting end to the narrative.
215	9077	4	3	The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author is well - aware that it’s bound to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it clearly says “in the spring … I will take this test again”. She is carefully preparing herself for the challenges of next year. She understands that the cycle of trying and potentially succeeding will repeat, and she is mentally and emotionally gearing up for it. This is why I think this paragraph ended with the story, as it provides a sense of closure while also hinting at the future possibilities and the character's forward - looking mindset.
216	9078	4	3	Saeng was sitting quietly at the dinner table, lost in thought about the test after finishing her meal. She knew deep down that she had the potential to do much better than before. With determination in her eyes, she made a vow to herself. She said that once the cold winter finally comes to an end and the warm spring starts to paint the world with colors, she would take the test again. And this time, she was confident that she will pass it with flying colors.
217	9079	4	3	Saeng wants to take the test again when the weather is beautiful outside and the hibiscus is budding. The hibiscus plant, with its vibrant petals, shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her pass the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished, with its sturdy stem and well - formed blossoms. These characteristics represent both the girl and the flower. The day was a particularly good day, with clear skies and a gentle breeze, and she wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tough, standing firm against the elements. This represents the girl in that time when she didn't pass. She told her mother about it, and her mother was very understanding, offering words of comfort and support. The plant represents beautiful things, just like the geese that fly gracefully in the sky, and both symbolize hope and success. The girl wants to take the test at that time of day and thinks she will get it right next time. When she completes and passes her test, she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings when she wants to pass the test.
218	9080	4	3	"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincere ""Saeng"" was towards the hibiscus flower. I say this because throughout the story, @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. She would often spend time looking at it, watering it gently, and admiring its beauty. I think she felt as though she could relate to the flower, both facing challenges and trying to thrive in their respective environments."
219	9081	4	3	The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beginning. Saeng says, “I – I failed the test.” Her voice is filled with sadness as she realizes her shortcoming. She is also really sad, with tears welling up in her eyes. But at the same time, she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life, just like how the world does every spring. The theme of the story is when life seems hard, take a new approach. She intends to retake the driver's test, with a new mindset and more determination.
220	9082	4	3	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower, which was once sheltered inside the store, now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside, facing the changing weather and different soil conditions. The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter, following their natural instincts to find a more suitable climate. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her driver's test. By ending the story with this paragraph, it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country, embracing the opportunities and challenges that come with it.
221	9083	4	3	"Minfong Ho ended her poignant story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optimistic sentence. She concluded it in this manner because the main character of the story, Saeng, was beginning to lose hope amidst her new life in a foreign land. Saeng, determined to overcome her setback, decided to retake the driving test when her hibiscus flower was in full bloom. This delicate flower served as a powerful reminder of her idyllic past life in Vietnam with her beloved grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb"", a memory that brought both comfort and a touch of sadness. She clearly preferred her life in Vietnam to hers in @LOCATION2. She patiently was going to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding,"" so she could feel more at ease and happy, finding the strength to face the test again. The author wanted to end it this way so that Saeng would finally find happiness and the readers could witness her resilience."
222	9084	4	3	The author ended the story with that particular ending because she understood the sadness that permeated the narrative and wanted to give hope to the reader. The message was clear: you should never give up on anything, and always keep trying. Moreover, it ends on a good and uplifting note. If it was like “I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying,” that would not be a suitable or inspiring ending. This ending not only gives hope to the reader but also imparts the valuable lesson of the importance of practice. When spring comes to an end, the lady is determined to practice driving so that when she takes the test, she will not fail. Also, the girl is gradually getting happier at the end, which in turn makes the reader happy. So, in conclusion, that ending for the story was a good choice for many compelling reasons. It makes the reader happy, gives the reader the courage to never give up, encourages them to practice something if they fail it the first time, and also reminds them to help their mother when she is planting or digging up plants, thus leaving a positive and lasting impression.
223	9085	4	3	The author concludes the story with this well - crafted paragraph in order to effectively develop the overarching theme and to project what the main character, Saeng, will do after she plants the hibiscus. I firmly believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life, and the author expertly builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Through these words, the author vividly demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver’s test, a significant setback. To cope with this disappointment, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start, a fresh opportunity for Saeng to face the test once the geese return and the natural world around her begins to awaken, indicating a time of renewal and possibility.
224	9086	4	3	So, to ensure that she did not forget to take the test again, Saeng made a silent vow to herself. She tied this promise to the blooming of the hibiscus, a natural and regular occurrence that would serve as a constant reminder. The hibiscus, with its vibrant colors and delicate petals, became a symbol of her determination and the new beginning she was waiting for. By linking her test - taking to the flower's growth, she created a tangible and meaningful way to stay focused on her goal.
225	9087	4	3	Saeng, a girl full of determination, did not give up on herself when faced with failure. She firmly believed that if she said she would take the driving test over again, then there was a good chance she might pass it. In life, it is a well - known fact that you will not always pass on your first try; sometimes, it takes a while to achieve success. Saeng's unwavering spirit serves as an inspiration, encouraging others to never give up just because they did not get it right on the first attempt. Moreover, in the process of making this decision, she also builds confidence in herself. She realizes that setbacks are just temporary roadblocks on the path to success. That is precisely why the author concluded the story in such a way, to showcase Saeng's resilience and to leave the readers with a message of hope and self - belief.
226	9088	4	3	The author ended the story with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, because he wanted to clearly show that the geese and the hibiscus plant represent a distinct sort of rebirth or revival to Saeng. He deliberately wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is an archetypal season; it is a well - known season of birth and growing. Saeng saw the hibiscus right after she failed the first test. It took her memories back to Vietnam, which truly comforted her. She believes that maybe when she sees the plant flourishing and the geese returning, she will experience that same revival again, and this new start will give her the strength to pass the test.
227	9089	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the very beginning of the story. After spending time with the plants and learning new things about them, it is quite natural for Saeng to take the test again in the spring (at the end of the story). I think this because Saeng learned that she has to get used to living in @LOCATION1. The plant reminded her that she has to adapt when she saw the geese fly in the ""V"" formation, which was exactly the same as back at home in Vietnam. She realized that it was similar to Vietnam and she has to take that driver's test again in order to fully get used to living in @LOCATION1 with all of its changes. I also think that it's perfect to end the story with her taking the driver's test in spring because the geese will come back, and the hibiscus is budding. This is the start for them as well as Saeng, marking a new chapter in her life in @LOCATION1."
228	9090	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. She wants to try to get a plant that will vividly remind her of her grandmother and also remind her of her old home where she hopes to @MONTH1 go back one day. So, she can see the real flower she loves and not the artificial one. This attempt to find that connection to her past through the plant is an important part of her journey in the new place, and it gives her the motivation to keep going.
229	9091	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story the way he does to clearly show that Saeng isn't giving up. In the spring, when the weather gets warmer and nature comes back to life, she will see the plant and remember her home which will significantly help her not feel as homesick. “Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” This quote clearly shows that when she sees familiar plants she is strongly reminded of home. So in the spring when her plant blooms, she will see it and feel more comforted and more at home. This sense of comfort will help her find the inner strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level, and this growth will likely lead her to success in the test.
230	9092	4	3	What I think the author was talking about is that the snow was outside and it was important for the story's matter. The snow started to slowly melt, which could symbolize a change or a new beginning. As the snow melts, it might represent the thawing of a difficult situation or the start of something fresh, and this could be related to the characters' experiences in the story.
231	9093	4	3	He concluded the story with that sentence because it clearly indicated that she learned a valuable lesson in life. On her journey all the way back home to the place where she originally came from, I bet she missed her friends dearly. Also, she surely missed seeing her mother working out in the garden during this cold time of the year. I guess they're poor in one way. In conclusion, he chose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and is even starting all over again, but with a better understanding from her learning experience.
232	9094	4	3	Saeng says this in the paragraph because she has a strong desire to make her mother proud of her. So, she is determined to take the test again after the winter season has passed. By doing so, she hopes to show her mother that she can achieve success.
233	9095	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it showcases more will - power. She has a deep love for the hibiscus, and what better way to end the story than to have her compare herself to the hibiscus. When she says “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she is drawing a parallel. Just as the snow is currently slowing down the hibiscus, the previous fail is slowing her down. So, she is going to spend time reading to prepare. When spring comes and the hibiscus is budding, she too will be “budding” by passing her test.
234	9096	4	3	In the article, the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the spring and the hibiscus strongly remind her of home. For example, in the article, she gets shaky when she can't say the word “home” because she misses it so much. So, she looks for things that remind her of it, like a plant called dok faeng - noi. It may not be the real plant from her home, but she gets it to evoke the feeling of where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds solace in this plant, and she loves the spring because it brings back memories of home. It makes one wonder what things remind others of their homes. Take a moment to think about it.
235	9097	4	3	The reason that the author chose to end this story with this paragraph is to tell the reader that as time progresses, things get better. Saeng failed the driver’s test because she simply wasn't ready at that moment. Similarly, the flower bloomed before it was fully ready. The author is subtly conveying the message that one needs to be patient. By being patient, good things will surely come one's way, and Saeng will likely pass the test in the future when she is better prepared.
236	9098	4	3	"The author chose to conclude the paragraph with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it clearly shows how the strength of the hibiscus is closely related to Saeng's strength. In the story, after failing her driver's test, Saeng finds comfort in a hibiscus native to her country. When she gets home, her mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This indicates that Saeng is faltering in her new foreign country. The end quote sums up that Saeng finds strength in the strength of the flowers, almost thinking if a flower can survive in a land away from its home, why can't I? By using this quote, the author effectively ties together the symbolism of the hibiscus and Saeng's own journey of resilience."
237	9099	4	3	When she is truly ready and has reached a state of being good, both in terms of her skills and mindset, she is saying she will take the test again. When the weather is nice and beautiful outside, creating a pleasant and positive atmosphere, then she will have the confidence to take the test again. The author was trying to tell us how she deeply felt about letting her mom down, perhaps experiencing a sense of guilt and a strong desire to make amends by succeeding on the test. This shows that her emotions are closely intertwined with the outcome of the test and her relationship with her mother.
238	9100	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's highly important to the story's overall theme and development. Also, it neatly closes the story up, providing a sense of finality. It's explaining that the girl is gradually starting to adjust to the new area, and she is going to put in more effort to get along well there. So, by saying she's going to take the test again, it means she's going to approach it in a new way, with a fresh perspective and renewed determination. The author put this at the end trying to make sense of everything that has happened in the story and show that the girl had undergone a significant change, growing more resilient and adaptable in the face of a new environment.
239	9101	4	3	In the short story “Winter hibiscus”, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author felt as though Saeng would be ready to take the test at that particular time. After going through the experiences in the story, such as finding comfort in the hibiscus and listening to her mother's words about its strength, Saeng has likely gained the necessary confidence and determination. The spring, with its melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, represents a time of renewal and growth, making it the ideal moment for Saeng to face the test again. This conclusion helps to bring the story to a satisfying close, showing Saeng's potential for success.
240	9102	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's clearly showing that she still has hope, despite the setback of failing the test. The hibiscus, with its ability to survive in a new and sometimes harsh environment, gives her hope and strength. In the spring, a season of new beginnings and growth, she will take her test again and will sincerely hope to pass it. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it encapsulates the theme of resilience and the power of hope, leaving the reader with a positive outlook on the character's future.
241	9103	4	3	"In the last paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes by saying ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". I think the author concludes with this quote because it clearly shows her strong determination to overcome this difficult obstacle. For Saeng, the hibiscus represents both comfort and the remarkable ability to overcome challenges. Saeng is an extremely strong - willed person, and she firmly believes in herself based on the determination that stems from her past experiences. The author concluded with that quote because it effectively showcases Saeng's unwavering determination, which will surely guide her towards future success."
242	9104	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story with that paragraph to vividly show how deeply meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text specifically stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng carefully dug out a hole and gently lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This simple yet significant action shows the reader that it is of great importance to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also, by having that conclusion statement, it helps the reader better understand Saeng's affection for her new country. Moreover, the conclusion paragraph offers a sense of comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story, it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus."" This also clearly shows the close connection between Saeng and the flower and how it supports her through every difficulty she faces."
243	9105	4	3	Why I think she added this is because she, much like the plant, needs time to grow before she takes the test again. Sometimes, in life, you truly need more time to prepare well enough to pass your test. Going through school doesn't just teach us the stuff we need to know from textbooks; it also helps us grow up and learn how to understand life in a deeper way. I, as a tenth - grader, can attest that I understand life much more than I did in first grade. She still has a lot of mental growing to do regarding her past and present experiences, and this time will be crucial for her success in the future test.
244	9106	4	3	"I believe that the author ended the story with this line to clearly show that hope for the girl was still alive and that even perhaps the flower had greatly inspired her. I believe that when she says ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"", she specifically chose this time for her to start anew and try again, just as everything else mentioned in the quote is rejuvenating. When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it vividly shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and a new beginning, just as she would strive to do when she tries again to succeed at passing the test she must pass. Also, the tone in which she said this clearly showed hope. She was both hopeful and determined that next time around, she would certainly achieve a passing grade."
245	9107	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale has come to an end, Saeng's life will continue to unfold. The paragraph provides a proper sense of closure for the reader and also explains that in due time, Saeng will take the test again. This will happen once she has further adapted to @LOCATION1 culture, allowing her to face the test with more confidence and better understanding.
246	9108	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants the main character to be successful and do good deeds throughout her life.
247	9109	4	3	In the response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because this story was about a plant growing back every year around the same time. The paragraph means, like I think, when the plant came back in spring and the geese would come back around it, it would be another test of growing and not letting the plant die, which also reflects the cycle of life and hope.
248	9110	4	3	From the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this story with the paragraph of what Saeng vowed silently because it is to show Saeng’s determination. The hibiscus was the plant she found, which closely resembled the one at “home,” to symbolize her comfort. The hibiscus symbolized her determination in life. “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” from this, you can conclude that Saeng is thinking of how she recognized the geese. It gives her greater confidence within herself. From this, “like the Geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched,” and this explains that there is still hope inside of her. This paragraph that the author had concluded ties together what Saeng is now hoping and believing in, showing her growth and new - found strength.
249	9111	4	3	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying and the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past, and that she is ready to embrace the future.
250	9112	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. She says, “Here let me help you mother.” This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, “almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar now.” This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn't think it is weird anymore. That is why the author concludes with that statement, to highlight Saeng's transformation and positive attitude.
251	9113	4	3	The author concludes the story with this: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is blooming, then I will take that test again!” because he or she is the one who crafted the story. One piece of information is that her family moved to the United States from Vietnam. Another is that the author might have based this story on her own experiences. Saeng fails her driving test but remains determined to try again in the more favorable conditions of spring.
252	9114	4	3	The author concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show the narrator realizes that even though she’s in a new country, some things are still the same. So she becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season, familiar to her now.” This quote clearly shows that the narrator has come to understand that even though aspects of how life has changed, some things remain the same. This also indicates that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it, she could pass it. The narrator also said, “Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes.” This quote vividly shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test. This means that the test was very important to her, with the added pressure to pass in a new environment. She is now ready to pass the test but will be more prepared. The theme of this story could be that things may discourage you, but the narrator has gone through many challenges recently and in the changing seasons, she finds the strength to persevere.
253	9115	4	3	The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt to the new circumstances. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring means she is going to try again, and not give up easily. The author has a sentimental value attached to the hibiscus. Since she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring to the hibiscus as a symbol of her country. Since she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closest thing she has to it, and therefore, she will patiently wait with the flower, using it as a source of hope and motivation to retake the test.
254	9116	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences from her past. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the Canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent the passing of time. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, just as her old home did. This shows her growing sense of belonging and acceptance in the new environment.
255	9117	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In several ways, this ending is significant. One reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story, she wanted something really badly. So she took it home and showed her mom. Then her mom looked at her weird, because in the story it said that “you what? Her mother stared at her incredulously.” So then she explains that she failed the driver's test, but she didn't give up. So at the end of the story, she said that she will take that test again. This shows her determination and resilience. So in conclusion, that is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, to highlight the character's growth and her refusal to be defeated by a setback.
256	9118	4	3	"The story ends with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author concludes with this to clearly show Saeng's determination to try again and to successfully pass her driving test next year. Also, the flowers, like the hibiscus, strongly reminded her of her home in Vietnam. For instance, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."" By next year when the flowers bloom, she would be more determined and fully ready for the test again. Moreover, the flowers blooming symbolizes starting a new life, and perhaps it could be the same for Saeng by passing her driver's test. That's precisely why the author ends with that statement."
257	9119	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is clearly saying that she'll never give up. She is firmly determined to conquer everything that comes her way. I believe she is expressing that she will take the test over and over again until she finally succeeds. That is exactly why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it conveys the powerful message that you should never give up in the face of challenges.
258	9121	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author ends the story saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that no matter what, even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time, she is not giving up until she passes and gets her driver's license. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because it indicates that Saeng can patiently wait till winter ends so she can see the hibiscus is budding, which symbolizes new hope and a fresh start for her driving test journey.
259	9122	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes in a way to closely relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character, failing her driver’s test. The author does this to effectively bring the reader back to the initial problem and yet helps the reader foreshadow what is going to happen in the future. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This sentence clearly informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland, it will assist her in moving on from the failure. When the hibiscus is making a new start by budding in the spring, Saeng will do the same, by retaking her driver's test. With this as a conclusion, the author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test, what was the point of that?” Instead, it provides a clear sense of closure and future possibility.
260	9123	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to precisely inform what her whole meaning was. For example, when she returned, she felt extremely great because she came back to where she truly belonged. One reason is what she “vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.” This statement meant that coming back was probably the best decision she could have made. It signified a return to a place of comfort and a new beginning, and this conclusion ties together the themes of homecoming and hope in the story.
261	9124	4	3	Well, it seems to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because, basically, to have sarcasm and put emphasis on what he was saying. By doing so, it makes it crystal - clear that he wasn't going to take the test again. In fact, he implies that basically, someone would have to kill him in order to make him take that test again. This extreme statement truly drives home his strong stance against retaking the test.
262	9125	4	3	The reason why I firmly believe the author concluded the story with this particular paragraph is because she has a strong desire to test the hibiscus again when it returns. For solid evidence, in the last paragraph, it clearly says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows her determination. That’s precisely why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph, as it reveals the character's future plans and adds a sense of hope.
263	9126	4	3	The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a well - defined cycle. And he didn't finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that sense of curiosity and an edge of anticipation gives the story a strong sense of suspense. By not tying up all the loose ends, it keeps the readers thinking about the story long after they've finished reading. This was indeed a well - written story and a very effective conclusion that adds to the overall charm of the narrative.
264	9127	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but firmly vows to take it again in the spring. The story was ended like this to vividly show that the girl will have a new beginning. For example, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (Ho). The hibiscus is a powerful symbol that makes her feel as though she is deeply connected to her homeland. So, if the hibiscus is budding, which represents the start of a new cycle, she feels that she will be able to embark on a new journey and do the same. This is the exact reason why the story ends like that, highlighting hope and renewal.
265	9128	4	3	These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in a serious and straightforward tone. Ending the story with a quote or riddle makes the reader have to deeply think about the conclusion. It would be rather ordinary if he just ended with what simply happened, so he deliberately added something that made the readers think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it was a different and unique way to wrap up the story, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
266	9129	4	3	Because she is eager to practice and enhance her driving skills, and when the flower gracefully blooms, she will go take the driving test again. And she firmly believes that she will try harder next time to achieve a better result.
267	9130	4	3	The author includes that particular paragraph because they wanted you to be able to vividly visualize it in your head rather than simply not seeing the picture. If you can form a clear mental picture, then it's a sign of good visualization ability, which helps in better understanding the text.
268	9131	4	3	The author concludes with that statement because she means that she will earnestly try to go a whole season without thinking about home. Since she failed in winter, she will try again in spring. One way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is strongly reminding her of how life was before they moved to the city. For example, when she smelled the plant, it almost seemed to gently take her back in time to when she was little and the plants were growing wild and looking so pretty. This shows her longing for the past and her determination to adapt to the new environment.
269	9132	4	3	The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The author does this as a powerful symbol of hope for the reader. Also, it's not just an ending where you never know what happens; it gives you something to look forward to. Furthermore, when the geese do come back and there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blooming beautifully, then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gradually gotten used to the idea of living in a new place and has met more friendly people. Meanwhile, having the hibiscus in bloom will bring back wonderful memories from when she was young and living in her homeland. This will greatly help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test. Also, I believe the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else. I know that I hate reading stories that just end and don't tell you what happens next. However, the author resolved this by clearly letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again with renewed determination.
270	9133	4	3	The last paragraph of the “Winter Hibiscus” reads “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow gently melts and the geese return gracefully and this hibiscus is budding delicately, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has a glimmer of hope and will bravely continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2. In the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as far away from her home in Vietnam as she initially believed. In the florist's shops, she sees “plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten, which drew her back into her childhood world.” The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails “the test” by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, overwhelmed by homesickness. By the end of the story, she recognizes that she is slowly becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is “almost familiar to her now,” such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be consumed by homesickness and to whole - heartedly think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her new home, marking her successful adaptation.
271	9134	4	3	The author ends the story that way to vividly show Saeng's newfound determination. The entire story revolves around Saeng's journey during one afternoon to come to full acceptance with her new home. Thus, it seems highly fitting to conclude with Saeng's firm determination to pass her driving test and successfully make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several elements that Saeng discovers, which make her feel at home, like “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus”. These specific elements lead Saeng to feel more at ease in her new surroundings and make it appropriate to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also deeply inspired by the hibiscus, which is “strong enough to make it through the cold months; that’s what matters”. This directly relates to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, when Saeng recognizes the geese, she realizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the clear realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events similar to the three above that contribute to Saeng's determination, so it’s entirely fitting to conclude the story with her unwavering determination. In this way, the ending neatly wraps up Saeng's journey of acceptance and determination.
272	9135	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that a new beginning is starting. For instance, the fact that they moved to a different country is a significant change. That's precisely what the author means when referring to the arrival of spring. Spring symbolically represents a new life, which is exactly what Saeng and her mother are embarking on. Also, the snow acts as a blanket covering the past and the hard times they've endured. Last but not least, when the hibiscus starts to bud, it also indicates a new beginning. So, if you combine all these elements, you can see that the hard times start to fade away as the snow melts, and then a new beginning unfolds when spring arrives and the flower buds. That is why the author included this paragraph in the story; Saeng and her mother needed a fresh start to leave behind the old and embrace the new.
273	9136	4	3	The author chose that sentence to be the concluding sentence because Saeng sincerely believes she deserves another opportunity to take the garden test. This is because she had failed the test previously, which led to her mother being disappointed in her. Saeng's past failure weighed heavily on her, and she realized that she needed to prove herself. And what Saeng says at the end of the story is that she's going to have more confidence when attempting the garden test again. With this new - found confidence, she hopes to overcome her past setback and succeed in the test, finally meeting her mother's expectations and achieving a personal milestone.
274	9137	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it marks the end of winter. Winter in the story likely represents a period of hardship, coldness, and perhaps a sense of stagnation. As winter ends, it signals a transition to a new phase. This could imply that the characters in the story are moving past difficult times and into a more hopeful and positive future. The end of winter brings the promise of new growth, just as the story might be leading the characters towards new beginnings and opportunities. By ending the story at this point, the author leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and the understanding that a fresh start is on the horizon.
275	9138	4	3	The author probably ends the story like that because it effectively creates a strong sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about overcoming various challenges. For example, Saeng had a driving test and unfortunately failed it. This failure not only affected her self - esteem but also added to her stress. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the complex thought of “home”. Saeng obviously cared deeply about failing the test; otherwise, she wouldn't have spent so much time thinking about it, which eventually led her to a greenhouse. At the greenhouse, she was intently looking for a specific plant to buy, a plant that reminded her of home. However, thinking of home and her grandmother made her feel sad and upset. Saeng has almost this internal battle within herself, struggling between her past and her new life. The author ends the story that way to give the reader a glimmer of hope for Saeng's future and to leave them with a sense of wonder about what lies ahead for her. This ending allows the reader to envision Saeng overcoming her challenges and finding her place in her new life.
276	9139	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that she's not the type to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also reveals that she's earnestly trying to like this country as much as she possibly can. Moreover, she is eagerly looking forward to spring time when the hibiscus is in full bloom. The blooming hibiscus will not only remind her of home but also of her new life in @LOCATION1, thus adding a touch of hope and continuity to the story.
277	9140	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant as it died. But now, winter is over and spring is here, so it's her chance to finally get that flower. For example, in the story, it vividly says that Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It's not her fault because, as the story describes, the wind was blowing harder, mercilessly tearing off the last remnants of green and chicory weeds. The story concludes in this way because there will surely be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand, symbolizing a new beginning.
278	9141	4	3	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph perhaps because Saeng wants to finish or maybe @CAPS2 Take the Test again when they come back. And also, the author is encouraging people not to give up on what you are doing with yourself. Then she says that ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She clearly means that she will not give up at all, showing her determination and resilience."
279	9142	4	3	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring, Saeng is going to retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the first time she took it. That is precisely why the author put that sentence at the end of the story, to hint at Saeng's second - chance and the new hope spring brings.
280	9143	4	3	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when spring arrives and the hibiscus is budding, it will strongly remind her of her homeland. This connection to home will give her the motivation and strength to take a fresh start at the test, making the end of the story a symbol of hope and renewal.
281	9144	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has firmly vowed to retake the test in the spring. When the snow gradually melts, the geese gracefully return, and the hibiscus begins gently budding, she will have much more confidence. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” Saeng feels deeply lonely because she hails from a different country and misses everything she once knew and loved dearly. Now, she has the hibiscus as a constant reminder of her beloved home, which will accompany her through this difficult time.
282	9145	4	3	The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to clearly show that there was a thoughtful process involved where SaenG was steadily learning and growing. At first, SaenG is extremely uneasy and deeply disappointed in herself. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng says with a trembling voice. “For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing,” her silence filled with a mix of shock and disappointment. You can tell at first the mother is clearly disappointed, but then as they start talking while planting, the atmosphere gradually eases. “How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon?” “I’d love it,” saeng said with a faint smile. Her mood has now lightened significantly, and she is making a calm, well - thought - out decision to try again. This is a very reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than being upset and distraught, as it shows her newfound resilience.
283	9146	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusually poignant ending. There are numerous reasons why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test, which plunged her into a deep silence. When she agreed to take the test over, it is a clear sign of her indomitable will to survive. It shows that she is tenaciously striving towards her goal until she finally achieves it. Finally, the ending could vividly represent a new beginning, much like when the snow slowly melts away, transforming the cold winter into a warm and hopeful spring. This is precisely what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means, and this is the exact reason why the author concluded it in such a meaningful way.
284	9147	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence because it clearly shows that Saeng is going to earnestly try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not going to wallow in grief and be sad anymore. Instead, she will bravely adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at - ”. This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother, and she is extremely sad because she has been deeply immersed in old memories of her old home. But by adding the last statement of the story, it clearly shows that Saeng has firmly decided to move on with life and no longer be trapped in sadness. She has set a clear goal to whole - heartedly accept her new situation. This is the fundamental reason for the author to conclude this story in the way he does.
285	9148	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because he was trying to subtly tell us that the hibiscus represents a precious comfort in a time of great disappointment for Saeng. She saw the plant right when she had just failed her driving test. The sight of the hibiscus offered her a glimmer of solace in the midst of her failure, as if it were a gentle reminder that there is still beauty and hope in her new life, despite this setback.
286	9149	4	3	Authors use conclusions to neatly wrap up a story, or to prompt the reader to engage in deeper thought. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author employs the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” He uses this conclusion to illustrate that she is going to adjust to this new culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop, she breaks down crying. It states “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” It is reasonable to infer that she is crying not because she used to fit in here, but because she didn't pass her test and fears she won't be able to. So, she motivates herself at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can integrate into this new world.
287	9150	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story in this way is that the author wants to demonstrate that she won't give up. That she will take the test again and exert more effort next time to surmount her challenge, rather than throwing in the towel. The author aims to show that she is not a quitter, and she is brimming with determination even though she faces conflicts. This conclusion serves to highlight her resilient spirit and the author's intention to convey a message of perseverance.
288	9151	4	3	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded with that paragraph because it reveals what she is going to do in the future. For example, in the story, she told her mom “I failed…” When she was placing the flower in the hole beside the garden, a flock of geese were flying, heading south. This scene sets a certain mood and also implies the passage of time and the cycle of life, which might be related to her future attempts and growth. In essence, the conclusion gives a glimpse into her upcoming journey.
289	9152	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has the desire to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that test again,” it indicates that she is aware she has another opportunity. It shows that she is strong - willed and won't give up easily. So what she is expressing in the last paragraph is the age - old adage: if you don't succeed the first time, keep trying. In the story, it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season.” In that part, one can clearly tell that she is already beginning to change. So I think next time she'll perform excellently, as her determination and the process of adaptation will surely pay off.
290	9153	4	3	I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it showcases her determination to pass the test. The test was to be capable of making the garden grow. You can infer this because it says “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows that the test she took had a connection with spring and the budding of flowers, suggesting that she was attempting to cultivate something. In this story, they mention her assisting her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn't thrive, she was resolved to try again. That's why I believe they chose to end with the statement about taking the test again in the spring, emphasizing her unwavering resolve and the hope for a better outcome.
291	9154	4	3	The author uses this paragraph because it vividly brings back memories from that particular moment during the “winter hibiscus” when Saeng carefully put down the soil, and right then, a large flock of Canada geese gracefully flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time, she felt so ashamed that she did not dare to look at her mother. She found herself depending on the hibiscus, which seemed to give her the strength to either want to retake the test, but she decided not to until they re - bud again.
292	9155	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to neatly conclude all the various things they talked about throughout the story. In the story, they often mentioned the beautiful spring time, and now, Saeng and her mother are joyfully planting flowers and taking care of everything in their little garden. This ending ties up the story and gives a sense of completion.
293	9156	4	3	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to clearly show that she won’t give up if the birds and the hibiscus don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reappear if they manage to survive the harsh conditions. That means they will stay strong in the meantime, just like her. She will bravely survive her new surroundings and gradually change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life, showing her resilience and determination.
294	9157	4	3	I think the author concludes the story the way he did because it will effectively make people want to read the next story to see if the test is passed. It adds a great deal of suspense to the story, leaving the readers eager to find out what happens next and whether the character will succeed in passing the test.
295	9158	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that powerfully represents Saeng’s firm decision to try again and to bravely overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her simply saying “I will try again next spring” to skillfully show diction and to present her goal or decision in a different, more nuanced way. For example, it says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.” At first, the sight of geese flying in the sky was completely new to her, but now she’s gotten used to it. Maybe the author is making a subtle reference to the geese since taking the driving test will become familiar to her, and she will pass it, just like she got used to and familiar with the geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she’s been steadily adjusting to changes in her life and to various circumstances. But, Saeng seemed extremely determined to survive and overcome it all. The paragraph is essentially saying simply that she’ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to artfully show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It effectively overtones the point in the story, which is to never give up and to have the strong will to survive.
296	9159	4	3	The author loves @CAPS1 plants deeply, so after every winter, her @CAPS2, which involves carefully examining the soil and weather conditions, to see if she can plant and grow beautiful plants begins. The spring @ORGANIZATION1 is the only @ORGANIZATION1 where you can grow one - of - a - kind plants like she grows. Her test is to grow a garden filled with a diverse range of beautiful plants and vegetables. The author will work hard, just like her mother did, to bring the gardens to life, especially after the harsh winter. Through her dedication, she hopes to create a vibrant and flourishing garden that showcases the beauty of nature.
297	9160	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking about how beautiful nature was. He also thought that since Saeng loved nature a great deal, she was going to go back to school to finish the test even though she could be at home in the garden, tenderly taking care of the plants. That's why I think the author decided to finish with that paragraph, as it would probably describe how much he likes nature and how nature can influence one's decisions and actions.
298	9161	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and deep - seated shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test. After the failure, she was in a state of despair. However, finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was vividly reminded of her home. And by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, just as she was in a new environment, she was able to make a strong emotional connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life. So, Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life by retaking her driving test, hoping for a fresh start and a successful outcome.
299	9162	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when everything returns to normal, like the geese gracefully return to their usual habitats and this hibiscus is budding with new life, “I will take that test again.” This means she will be willing to move forward, face new challenges, and try to adapt to the new environment with renewed determination. It shows that she is looking forward to a fresh start and is ready to overcome the obstacles that come her way.
300	9163	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she is not going to give up on @LOCATION2. Instead, she will keep patiently working at understanding our customs, gradually integrating into the new community. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus vividly representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new life here just like the hibiscus does at her house, adapting and growing in a new environment. Finally, the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many warm and cherished memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with the challenges of @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph effectively shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold precious memories.
301	9164	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by @PERSON1, a teenage girl named Saeng and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test. As she strolls along the familiar streets, she passes a well - known plant. Intrigued, she then goes into a nearby florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test. Of course, her mother is upset, but she still makes dinner. The plant, the “winter hibiscus,” becomes a source of comfort. At the end of the story, Saeng thinks to herself, “when they come back, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be okay and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming and full of new possibilities.
302	9165	4	3	The author concludes the story with this line because it clearly shows that the geese were given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. For instance, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote vividly shows that the hibiscus was the driving reason for her determination. It implies that she would come back, just like the geese did. That's why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to effectively show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up in the face of difficulties.
303	9166	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author ends with that paragraph because it powerfully shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year without fail and flowers always bud every year as a natural cycle. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do, with unwavering resolve. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined, she might never pass and integrate into her new society, but with this determination, she has a real chance of success.
304	9167	4	3	I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcomes obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sign of hope for the future. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is upset about failing her driver's test and then, on top of that, she gets upset about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ‘When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub.’” This quote clearly shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland close to her. This quote: “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this plant. This is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1, which is precisely why she ended the story with this sentence, highlighting the new - found hope in her life.
305	9168	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life just yet. When everything turns back to normal, she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example, she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like geese.” This means that she has become used to change and has accepted the situation. She is waiting for the right time, marked by the cycle of her flowers, to take the next step in her life and face the challenges ahead.
306	9169	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because, in this peculiar situation, the snow doesn't melt in the spring as it typically should. The geese, which usually return in the winter, seem to be missing. And the hibiscus, a beautiful plant that Saeng adored, is not budding until spring either. This abnormal state of nature reflects the current circumstances and perhaps Saeng's inner turmoil. The hibiscus holds a special place in Saeng's heart, and its delayed budding might symbolize her own struggle to bloom in this new environment. All these elements together contribute to the author's choice of ending the story in this way.
307	9170	4	3	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This setback truly crushed her spirit. She yearns to be reminded of her old homeland, where she didn't have to worry about passing driving lessons. So, she makes her way to a greenhouse to search for plants that are similar to the ones she used to have back home. She hopes that by doing this, she can make herself feel better. However, even in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng breaks down and weeps. She feels like a failure. But the hibiscus gives her a glimmer of hope and brings back memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesn't yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. “I'm glad you got it,” Saeng's mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together, they care for the hibiscus. By doing this, they are planting Saeng's hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but also to make it in the new country. The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides that if the hibiscus can grow, then so can she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support, and because she has adapted. The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings, just as it has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt, and Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country, showing that with determination and adaptation, she can overcome her challenges.
308	9171	4	3	The author is trying to communicate that Saeng will never give up. Her confidence will gradually grow, much like the hibiscus in the spring. By comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph, the author shows how she will grow and advance to retake the test when the right time arrives. The snow melting represents her sorrows slowly fading away. The sun symbolizes her path to success, showing how she will grow like the hibiscus plant she bought. When the plant grows in the sunlight, it represents her increasing confidence to take the test next time. The cold, brisk snow is like her negative self - esteem and attitude, which will be replaced by a more positive outlook. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to clearly show how it relates to her life and attitude. This comparison also indicates how her life will change for the better as a result of the hibiscus plant, inspiring her to face her challenges with newfound strength.
309	9172	4	3	The author concludes her story with this paragraph because it really shows the heart and the perseverance Saeng has. Through the events and her reactions, we can see how deeply committed she is to overcome her difficulties. Also, it tells a lot about her character. Her resilience and determination are on full display, making the reader admire her. Ending the story in this way creates a strong mood. It leaves a lasting impression on the reader, highlighting the importance of not giving up in the face of adversity. That is why she ended the story the way she did, to leave the reader with a powerful message about strength and perseverance.
310	9173	4	3	When the snow melts and the geese return, it is a clear sign that spring is approaching. The melting snow, which has covered the ground in a cold, white blanket, gives way to the warmth of the sun. The return of the geese, flying in their characteristic V - formation, is a familiar sight that signals the changing of the seasons. This natural cycle not only marks the transition from winter to spring but also brings a sense of renewal and hope. It is a time when nature awakens from its slumber, and new life begins to emerge. So, when the snow melts and the geese return, it truly means that spring is almost here, bringing with it the promise of a fresh start.
311	9174	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author felt like she would be ready for the new test. In the text, it states that after walking home dejectedly after failing the linear driver test, she sees a familiar plant by the roadside. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. This shows that she will take the test again because she feels as though she is confident to pass it the next time around.
312	9175	4	3	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her driver's test, Saeng was feeling defeated and worthless, thinking she had let herself and her family down. Her mother took this into consideration and didn't get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact, she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this, carefully preparing the soil and gently placing the flower in it, she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng's mother was out in the cold, her hands red from the chill, planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example, Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her driver's test again, and ultimately live with the same positive and resilient attitude her mother has.
313	9176	4	3	They can compare the story and this statement to each other because in the story, the protagonist does not give up despite facing challenges. Similarly, the person who is taking the test again did not give up. They failed the first time but are determined to succeed, which is why they are taking it again. This shows that both the story and the test - taker embody the spirit of perseverance.
314	9177	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph in hope. The conclusion the author made was to say that over that amount of time, Saeng will have overcome that failure and will be more prepared for the test for a second time. In the text, it says how Saeng realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before, like the local customs and the way of life in the new place, have become almost familiar, which is an obvious improvement. This indicates that with time, she has adapted and grown stronger, ready to face the test anew.
315	9178	4	3	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to show the change in Saeng's heart and attitude toward her new life in @LOCATION1. Spring symbolizes rebirth, and the author doesn't include this on accident. Spring will be Saeng's time of rebirth where she can take the test and restart her new life in @LOCATION1. ""When the snow melts"" is included because winter symbolizes death and when the snow melts away, so will Saeng's fears. As the snow gradually recedes, it represents the clearing of the obstacles and negative emotions in her life, allowing her to embrace a fresh start and face the test with newfound confidence."
316	9179	4	3	Will you notice in the spring when the snows melt, and the grass isn't as pretty as it seems. It's a muddy grass, perfect for the pigs who love to wallow in mud. How about a mud bath, Ford? See what winter can do to you. How about the tree now, waiting for leaves to live. It's truly a good life.
317	9180	4	3	The author deliberately chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to clearly show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because the text states, “overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now” (second to last paragraph). Just like when she buys the hibiscus, it holds many precious memories from home, which helps keep her going. Her mother still making an “omelet with slices of bitter melon” made her eyes water. This simple act, reminding her of home, gave her the hope and determination to not give up, and it shows that even in difficult times, memories can be a powerful source of strength.
318	9181	4	3	Saeng has a deep love for flowers and plants. The author concludes this paragraph with the story because it seamlessly goes along with the overall narrative. In the spring, when the snow gradually melts, Saeng was eagerly waiting for winter to be over so she could see the plants and flowers again. Saeng highly values plants and truly enjoys the process of planting them. The author includes that paragraph to vividly show how Saeng is so passionately in love with plants. She simply couldn't wait for the new winter break to be over, as she was longing to be surrounded by the beauty of nature once more.
319	9182	4	3	The author ends the story with that particular paragraph because it effectively shows how Saeng feels a strong emotional connection to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is of great importance because it clearly demonstrates how people can find meaningful ways to deal with changes in their lives. Saeng achieves this by carefully buying and patiently planting the hibiscus plant so that she can regularly see it and be constantly reminded of home. Additionally, she buys the plant because it serves as a powerful motivation for her to retake the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding, symbolizing new beginnings and hope.
320	9183	4	3	Because she is confused and not yet accustomed to the country she is in, it's difficult for her to concentrate on her test. However, she believes that as soon as the flower will bloom, since she will feel more like she's at home, she thinks that she will be able to perform better on the test. This shows that the sense of familiarity and comfort the blooming flower brings can have a positive impact on her mental state and academic performance.
321	9184	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the sight of the hibiscus brings her a sense of comfort. She says, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. As it is revealed in the story that the author failed the test, she believes that taking the test again when the hibiscus reappears after the snow season will offer her the comfort and confidence she needs. This connection to the hibiscus and the cycle of seasons gives her hope for a better outcome next time.
322	9185	4	3	The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese return in the spring, she will make another attempt to pass the test. This is in line with the saying “if at first you don't succeed, try try again”. Additionally, the author uses this conclusion to illustrate that Saeng has been in the @LOCATION2 for several years and still harbors a longing for her home back in Vietnam. This longing is intertwined with her determination to overcome the setback of the test and look forward to a new opportunity in the spring.
323	9186	4	3	She thinks she is going to pass the test in the spring because during this season, everything comes back to life. Flowers begin to bloom, trees regain their lush greenery, and the whole landscape turns vibrant. The geese are returning, and animals start to emerge from their winter slumber. People head to the beach to relax and distract themselves. Perhaps she believes that the positive energy and new beginnings of spring will also bring her good luck and the motivation she needs to pass the test.
324	9187	4	3	The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she experiences a renewal of hope. She was deeply upset after failing the driving test, and the sight of the hibiscus flower made her even more emotional as it reminded her of her home. However, when she saw the geese as she finished planting the flower, she found a new sense of determination. She decides that she will try to retake the test next spring, seeing the return of the geese and the cycle of the seasons as a sign of new possibilities and a chance to overcome her previous failure.
325	9188	4	3	The author concludes the story with, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to vividly show Saeng's process of growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will gradually become more at ease with her current circumstances. She will be ready to start afresh, just as all the plants around her will be blooming and budding when spring arrives. Failing her driver's test really took a toll on Saeng's emotions. By waiting another year, she will have sufficient time to practice more and improve her skills. This way, when she goes back to retake the test, she will be a much better - equipped driver. It is almost like a brand - new beginning for Saeng. As her familiar hibiscus plant buds and starts anew, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant holds a special place in Saeng's heart and is familiar to her, she can easily relate to its cycle of renewal. In conclusion, this is precisely why the author concluded the story with that meaningful phrase, highlighting Saeng's personal growth and the hope for a better future.
326	9189	4	3	I think the author includes this particular paragraph in the story because it makes perfect sense. The geese typically come back home after the snow melts, and around that same time, Saeng tries to take her test again. This connection between the natural cycle of the geese and Saeng's attempt at the test adds a layer of symbolism to the story.
327	9190	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story with “When they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to clearly show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still requires some time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles greatly with overcoming the challenge of moving from her familiar home to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. However, Saeng still isn't fully ready to let go of her home yet. So she tries to hold on to her old memories, only to find that in this new place, everything is different. When she buys a plant that is familiar to her, she realizes that even it is different in this new location, and gets angry that it isn't what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that being different isn't always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but knows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so. This shows her gradual growth and acceptance in the face of change.
328	9191	4	3	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph like that because when the spring arrives, she is going to try again. When I was reading this story, it's stated in the text that her mother had asked her “What happened?” And Saeng replied “I - I failed the test”. So I am predicting that her mother is going to offer more help to her with her studying and with her gardening. When the snow melts, Saeng vows to herself that this time she will work harder and pass the test, showing her determination to improve.
329	9192	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is precisely when she will take the test again. Also, because the geese made her realize that many of the things that she had initially thought were strange before had gradually become familiar to her. Just like the geese that return season after season, it was through the quiet repetition of season upon season that she started to see the normalcy in the new environment. This realization is what makes the ending paragraph significant in the story.
330	9193	4	3	She ends with that paragraph because it represents a fresh start. When the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, it's like a restart, and she can try again at dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able to handle it better and take the test again. This ending shows that she won't give up easily, and is willing to face the challenges of a new life with perseverance.
331	9194	4	3	"She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant alive, she felt a deep sense of disappointment in herself. That's why she said, ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" When she failed, her mother comforted her, saying it will be okay and that she can always try again. The mother's words gave her the strength to face the future with hope."
332	9195	4	3	I believe that the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that she is telling both the reader and herself that, in my opinion, she will once again work in the garden to see if it truly catches her interest. The author is trying to express this because at the beginning of the story, she shows no interest in the garden or the world around her. For instance, when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden, she used some of her mother's money to buy herself a Big Mac. So, in conclusion, what I've written clearly shows how the author feels and why she ended the story the way she did, highlighting her possible shift in attitude.
333	9196	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because Saeng failed the test previously and now has a strong desire to pass it. On that day, she learned a great deal from her mother, which completely transformed her attitude towards life. With this new - found perspective, she is determined to succeed in the test when the right time comes.
334	9197	4	3	The author might have concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still deeply cares about the test rather than a merely plant that is likely to die anyway. Also, because she needs to pass the test, and the author is hinting that in the end, the girl is going to pass and won't have to retake that test again. Moreover, the author wants us to know that it's not all about other expensive things in life, but that school is really more important than anything. This conclusion emphasizes the girl's focus on her academic success.
335	9198	4	3	The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the last paragraph was that in the story, the girl went out for a test. Although I don't know exactly what the test is, she failed it and returned with a saebba hedge, which is a tamed plant for the family. The family adores this plant. As I understand from the story, they are newcomers to a country, and that country is @LOCATION1. They've moved here from Vietnam. She takes her driving test and comes home having failed. One of the things her mother asks is, “why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could have had the famed bee - maags,” which is the mother's attempt to say a Big Mac, their favorite fast - food sandwich. The reason the daughter comes back with the plant is that she feels she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. “Then when the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.” She firmly believes that the next time she goes, she will pass the test, and she won't be ashamed of it. She hopes to make her parents proud by passing the test because, from what I gather, it is a high honor to the family. In Vietnam, not many people drive, and they want their daughter to achieve this as it is something they don't have in their homeland.
336	9199	4	3	It is clear that Saeng is deeply in the midst of a struggle during a time of intense homesickness after recently relocating from Vietnam. The new environment feels foreign and disorienting, making her long for the familiarity of her homeland. But as time steadily goes on, she will gradually learn to balance the strong affection she feels for both her new country and her beloved homeland. As Saeng progresses through the story, it is quite apparent that she yearns for the precious memories of her homeland, yet she is beginning to discover new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is tenderly touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, a symbol of her past, she is also intrigued by the new experiences, such as savoring Big @CAPS1 and making new friends. While homesickness has undeniably caused her to struggle, she knows that with the passage of time she will be able to overcome the difficult obstacle of leaving the old ways for the new without completely eradicating either. She is firmly convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the unwavering confidence to pursue any challenges that will arise in her future.
337	9200	4	3	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to vividly show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is extremely brutal, just like Saeng's mum said. The cold winds howl and the snow piles up, making it a harsh and unforgiving season. But spring is when things come alive. The flowers bloom, the birds sing, and there is a new sense of hope in the air. I think this is showing a profound sense of renewal in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you might get tossed around by the strong wind, it is a temporary phase. When spring comes, she will bravely try the test again and come to life, ready to embrace and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even though she is far from the familiar rain of her homeland. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vow, as it leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and the belief in Saeng's ability to overcome.
338	9201	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to convey the idea that whenever something leaves their home, they always have a longing to come back. The hibiscus, with its vibrant colors and sweet fragrance, reminds her of home, and that is where her heart truly yearns to be. Saeng had unfortunately failed her drivers test, and she said when the geese come back, a sign of the changing seasons and a return to a more hopeful time, I will do it again. The plant, though it may resemble the ones from her past, is not the same. She remarks, “Not like the ones we had before” (Ho). She is trying to express that the ones over at Vietnam are better in her eyes, and she wants to go back because she misses the familiar sights, sounds, and feelings of her homeland deeply. This longing for home is a powerful emotion that drives her and gives the story a sense of authenticity and emotional depth.
339	9202	4	3	Saeng is talking about the beautiful flowers coming back in the spring time. The thought of the flowers blooming again fills her with hope and anticipation. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is completely gone, as the snow represents the obstacles and hardships of the present. She is determined to do it again, to prove to herself and others that she can overcome her challenges. “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing.” This description of the harsh wind and the dying weeds shows the current difficult situation. So she can't wait until it is spring again. She dreams of the warm sun, the gentle breeze, and the colorful flowers. So she can try to plant again, not only literally but also metaphorically, to start anew and build a better life in her new home.
340	9203	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying that when everything returns to the way they were in a sense of renewal and hope, she will do everything again. She doesn't want things to remain the same as they used to be; she wants to make positive changes. She wants to learn from her past experiences, grow stronger, and embrace the new opportunities that come her way. By doing so, she hopes to create a more fulfilling and meaningful life. The author's choice to end the story with this message leaves the reader with a sense of possibility and the understanding that change can be a powerful force for good. It is a fitting conclusion that ties together the themes of resilience, hope, and the desire for a better future.
341	9204	4	3	The girl, Saeng, seems to have a deep attachment to nature and truly enjoys it when spring arrives. As she said, a new natural cycle starts, and this renewal will motivate her to retake the test that she previously failed. The author most likely concluded the paragraph in this way to show that there is hope for Saeng. She will take the necessary steps to live comfortably in her new home country. The whole story depicts how she remains unsatisfied with her new home, but it transitions to a new phase with fresh chances and a new life, which the author effectively portrays using the imagery of springtime.
342	9205	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that perhaps by this time, Saeng will become comfortable with her new home. I can relate to this because when I moved to a new place, I didn't like it initially as I didn't have many friends. However, after a year or two, I was fine because I had made a lot of friends. This is similar to Saeng, who misses her old home as she constantly talks about it and cries. For example, when she saw the plant that was the same as the one she had at her old home, she started crying due to the nostalgia. In conclusion, that is the reason why the author put that at the end of the story, to suggest a positive change in Saeng's attitude towards her new home.
343	9206	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author included an important part at the end where Saeng vowed. The reason why she made that vow is that when everything in her life restarts, she will love her life again and become a much happier person. This vow represents her hope for a better future and her determination to embrace the new opportunities that come with a fresh start. It shows that despite the hardships she has faced, she has the strength to look forward and find happiness in her new circumstances.
344	9207	4	3	The author in this part does this because it shows what Saeng is going to do after she failed. This story reveals what she must do, and it is inspired just from the geese. The geese symbolize perseverance and the ability to overcome challenges. Just as the geese migrate and face difficulties on their journey, Saeng realizes that she too can face her setbacks and move forward. By observing the geese, she gains the motivation and inspiration to take action and work towards her goals.
345	9208	4	3	I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test, she experiences a moment of weakness and feels lonely. Then, she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a sense, the plant provides her with comfort. “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” In this quote, Saeng’s mother tells her that the flower, although out of place, has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph, Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the courage to face her fears. She decides to retake the tests, showing her newfound resolve and the start of a new chapter in her life.
346	9209	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with this final paragraph to clearly convey that she's resolute and won't give up. Moreover, she aims to show the same determination to her mom, leaving a powerful message of perseverance.
347	9210	4	3	I believe the author was saying a new start. I say this because of how everything in the story seems to be coming back to a sense of normalcy. I also say it because Saeng, after going through various experiences, now knows what's truly important and will take those things seriously. That is what I think the author was trying to convey at the end of the story, a message of new beginnings and self - awareness.
348	9211	4	3	During “Winter Hibiscus” written by Minfong Ho, a young girl and her mother move to a new place, and the daughter Saeng is having a really hard time adjusting. Saeng found a plant called dok faeng - noi that strongly reminds her of home. So she bought it and took it home to show her mom. At first, her mother was upset that she bought a $NUM1 dollar plant. But then, after hearing her daughter express disappointment in herself, she found joy in the beautiful plant while she was cooking dinner. Saeng planted the beautiful plant and told herself that when the geese return, the hibiscus is budding, and it's spring, she will retake the test. She found strength within herself and the courage to do better. I think the author wanted to show how she gained respect for herself by the end of the passage. That is why the author ended it like she did, to highlight this personal growth.
349	9212	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is centered around. It is about how Saeng misses home and failed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she got distracted by buying the flower and was lost in memories of her home, which made her sad. In that last paragraph, she is saying that when the geese come back in the spring, she will be well - adjusted to the new country and home, and will not fail the test again. If she is tempted by something from home, she will resist taking it because she knows it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story, clearly showing her process of getting used to the new home and learning from her mistakes.
350	9213	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to sum it all up neatly. By using this ending, the author not only ties up the loose ends of the plot but also keeps the reader wondering about Saeng's future and how she will continue to grow in her new environment.
351	9214	4	3	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the gentle snow melts and the graceful geese return and this vibrant hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, to show that even though she failed her test, she isn't giving up and that she will persevere over this set - back and continue to try. This ending vividly shows the determination in Saeng’s heart. Saeng has enough inner determination to go on even though she failed her test and let her grandmother down. She is resolved to continue trying, both for her grandmother's memory and for herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story as it leaves a powerful and inspiring message.
352	9215	4	3	Having failed the driver's test really upset Saeng deeply. Not only that, but she had to move to a new country, and the painful loss of her grandmother really made things even worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story is like a powerful symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of the life she had in Vietnam. The way memories flood back to her as she sees these beautiful flowers clearly shows how she felt. It was all about starting anew and bravely overcoming obstacles. When she says, “... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, it shows her starting afresh and making it through the tough times, symbolized by the cold winter. It was a perfect symbol of herself and the hardships she will surely overcome, highlighting her resilience.
353	9216	4	3	In the story, the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he shows that even amidst her hardships, Saeng goes on with determination and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move to a new place. For example, when it says, “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.” This clearly shows that even after one failure, you should never give up, but also don't forget the past experiences that have shaped you. It is a valuable lesson that the author conveys through Saeng's story, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
354	9217	4	3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus”, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, “When they come back… in the lovely spring… then I will take that test again.” (No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move forward with hope in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome the disappointment of failing the test. The narrative also states, “… in the spring… when… this delicate hibiscus is budding…” (No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh, like a clean slate. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new and promising life. Saeng is also starting afresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adapt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through those disappointing times with its comforting presence. The geese also were a gentle reminder that some things back home were still the same, providing a sense of continuity. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's remarkable adaptations and her ability to find hope in a new environment.
355	9218	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to tell people that she's going to take the test again and make a sincere attempt. She's going to be like the resilient flowers, but she needs time to gather her strength. So, when they bud, full of life and promise, she will be ready to face the test once more, showing her determination to move forward and not be defeated by failure.
356	9219	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the story ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow of failing the test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in full bloom at @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says “I - I failed the test (@NUM1). This shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers bloom at @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself “...in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” (pg @NUM2) This shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward to taking the test again, indicating her growing resilience.
357	9220	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and the unfamiliar sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and her beloved homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By promising that she’ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels about @LOCATION1. By passing the test, she allows herself to move forward with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life, achieving a sense of harmony between her past and present.
358	9221	4	3	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and when she does, she feels like she is at home again. The sight of the budding flower brings a warm and comforting feeling, as if she is surrounded by the familiar embrace of her homeland. Then she will take the test. She also will feel lucky and have a vivid memory of home so Saeng vowed silently to herself. This vow is a sign of her determination to face the challenges ahead with the strength drawn from her cherished memories.
359	9222	4	3	The author concludes the story with the sentence, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The story tells us most of the hard times and obstacles Saeng has had to go through. The two major ones in this story were moving to a new place and failing her arriving test. Moving to a new place meant leaving behind her old life, friends, and the familiar environment. Failing the arriving test added to her sense of disappointment and self - doubt. Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. So I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that she was going to be ok, and overcome everything that happened. Now we know this special plant will help Saeng with future problems, acting as a constant source of inspiration and comfort.
360	9223	4	3	After reading the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it established a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it states that “Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it”. This shows that this plant means a lot to her. The story tells the reader that it holds memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back the happy memories she once had, which push her to try to overcome the loss better. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it reflects Saeng’s will for hope and peace. It represents that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new - found sense of hope and happiness, ready to embrace the future with a positive outlook.
361	9224	4	3	ìWinter Hibiscusî, by Minfong Ho, is a poignant story about Saeng's transition to a new place @LOCATION1 and her discovery of her own inner strength. Saeng was full of anticipation when taking the driver's test, but unfortunately, she failed. Disappointed and dejected, she slowly walked home with her head down. On her way, she stopped at a charming florist shop because she spotted a plant that closely resembled the one she had back in her homeland. The sight of this familiar plant immediately transported her back in time, and a flood of memories from her homeland came rushing back. She carefully bought the plant and carried it home with care. Once home, she tenderly planted it in a small pot on her windowsill and vowed to take the driving test again when the geese returned. The plant was like a gentle source of encouragement to her, reminding her that she had the resilience to overcome challenges in this new place.
362	9225	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story centered around the protagonist getting accustomed to the cyclical nature of things in the natural world. Throughout the narrative, the character experiences the repetitive patterns of nature, which gradually teach her to accept and adapt. So, the author added the last paragraph, stating that when all the natural phenomena happen again, she will respond in the same way, showing that she has truly internalized the lessons learned. This conclusion effectively ties up the story's theme of acceptance and adaptation to the repeating cycles of nature, which is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
363	9226	4	3	I think the author includes that because she might have faced difficulties and failed in some aspects. She probably needs more time to thoroughly study and understand things to get them right, to reach that level of @NUM1 proficiency. Other than that, it could also be that there are new elements or concepts that are causing confusion. Maybe these new things are making it harder for her to grasp everything quickly. So, it seems reasonable that the author includes this part to account for these possible challenges and the need for additional time and effort.
364	9227	4	3	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to vividly show that Saeng's hope is fully restored. Throughout the story, Saeng is deeply sad as she constantly misses her home. In this new and unfamiliar land, she often feels lost and hopeless, as if she is adrift in a sea of uncertainty. The hibiscus, however, acts as a powerful trigger, reminding her of the warmth and comfort of home. It brings back precious memories of her being at home with her beloved grandmother, sitting in the garden, and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. These memories initially make her long to be back home, but they also gradually give her the strength to face her current situation. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they, too, have to leave their familiar home and embark on a long journey, just like Saeng. The hibiscus is a powerful symbol of her inner strength, indicating that she will persevere and make it through the challenges of moving to this strange new land.
365	9228	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly show that Saeng won't give up and will keep trying with determination. In the story, all the memories of her old country served as a wellspring of inspiration, encouraging her to be strong in the face of adversity. For example, when she first saw the flower, it made her feel sad as it intensified her longing for home. However, as time passed, the flower became a source of comfort and motivation, and in the end, it made her a better and more resilient person. Also, in the beginning, Saeng was quite resistant to the new changes in this unfamiliar land and constantly missed her home. But at the end, she realized that some of the same beautiful memories she had back home could also be found in her new country. These shared memories gave her a sense of connection and belonging. Those are the compelling reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph, highlighting Saeng's growth and her unwavering spirit.
366	9229	4	3	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough inner strength to come back after a tough period and flourish vibrantly, then Saeng, too, has enough strength to bounce back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says “but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This powerful quote vividly shows that the hibiscus plant is incredibly strong. And Saeng keenly sees that as a sign that if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold, harsh winter, then she can surely return to the test after facing a failure. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong, and their resilience is truly inspiring.
367	9230	4	3	In this story, it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are strikingly similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding environment and how she and the plant will keep steadily continuing on their paths, just like Saeng with her “test”. The story shows this similarity clearly. But I know this because it says “Then I will take that test again”. Her saying that is her firmly stating that she will thrive again, just like the resilient hibiscus plant. So, in conclusion, she really is much like the plant and will continue to persevere for many seasons to come and also adapt well to the changes, just as the hibiscus does in nature.
368	9231	4	3	The author ended the story with the last paragraph because when spring time arrives and the geese gracefully return, Saeng will feel much better about herself. With this improved self - feeling, she can go and take the test again with a more focused mind and pay more attention to the details of the test, increasing her chances of performing well. In this way, the ending paragraph ties in nicely with the hope of a fresh start and renewed determination in the story.
369	9232	4	3	In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it seamlessly goes along with the overall theme of the story. In the story, Saeng went on a heartfelt search for the plant that sweetly reminded her of her grandma. After she finally found the plant, a flood of memories of her grandma came rushing back, and she couldn't help but cry. I think she was internally testing herself to see if she had truly moved on with her life, but unfortunately, she failed that self - test. So, I think she bought the plant as a symbol of hope, so she can try again when the plant is in full, beautiful bloom, signifying a new beginning and a chance at success.
370	9233	4	3	He wants to learn the hibiscus spirits. One should not be afraid of failure. You just need to keep moving ahead, continuously to learn what you truly want. Then, you will achieve success. Just like the hibiscus has a strong will to live: it bravely fights with the environment. So, the author uses this paragraph to conclude the story. The purpose is that Saeng will take this test again, just as the hibiscus will start budding when spring comes, showing that new beginnings and opportunities for success are always possible.
371	9234	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, as the gentle spring breeze caressed the budding hibiscus flowers. In the spring, when the hibiscus is in full bud, showing its tender and vibrant life, she will take the test. I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to test them again, to see if they can embrace new challenges and growth.
372	9235	4	3	The author ended that story like that because that’s exactly how she started the story. At the very beginning, the little girl was carefully looking at the various flowers and plants in the garden, observing their unique shapes and colors. So, the author thought that it would be a perfect thing to end the story in the same way it was started. Also, because the deep - seated friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming gorgeously and looking very beautiful. It clearly shows that the plants give a strong sense of comfort when she is going through hard times. That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants, highlighting the unbreakable bond between them.
373	9236	4	3	In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a deeply meaningful paragraph. The author tries to convey a profound message to Saeng. When Saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance,” she couldn't help but think of herself. “When they come back,” Saeng firmly believes that she will also come back to school with a new mindset. “The geese return and this hibiscus is budding” vividly means that Saeng will return to the school and transform into a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” clearly states that Saeng is still growing steadily, just like the hibiscus in the spring. She will then take that test again because it’s a brand - new start for her and a fresh beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. Since the flowers will be growing vigorously and having a new lease on life, so will Saeng, ready to embrace the challenges ahead.
374	9237	4	3	Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again, with its delicate petals slowly unfurling, she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to Saeng, suggesting that things can work out on a second try. The author concludes the story with the vow because it expresses her last bit of unwavering hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, where she is surrounded by new and unfamiliar surroundings. But it also explains how she feels, a sense of connection and resilience. She vows to show she won't give up despite failing the first time. For example, “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral” (Ho). This quote precisely explains what the plant meant to her, a source of strength and inspiration. This is why she concluded the story with a vow, to highlight her indomitable spirit.
375	9238	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s firm resolution. Her family had left a great deal behind in Vietnam, including the warm memories of their home and loved ones. She had the precious memory of her grandmother and the beautiful hibiscus. In the @LOCATION2, they are struggling as clearly implied by the mother's worried reaction at the high cost of living. The hibiscus she bought was a way to comfort her, a familiar sight in an unfamiliar land. She thinks that if the plant can endure the harsh winter environment, withstanding the cold and snow, she can persevere despite the differences in the @LOCATION2. Passing the driver's exam is something that many do and is a practical way to get used to her surroundings and fit in, to feel more at home in this new place.
376	9239	4	3	The author concludes the story with this sentence because it clearly shows that the girl is highly willing to overcome obstacles. Although she might have failed once in @MONTH1, she will definitely keep trying. It also reveals a distinct connection between the geese, the hibiscus, and the girl's strong desire to overcome her obstacles. Moreover, the girl has a specific time in mind when she wants to overcome her obstacle, which adds a sense of purpose to her determination.
377	9240	4	3	In the last paragraph, when she said she was going to have the test again, she specifically mentioned that it would be in the spring when all the snow melts and the hibiscus buds. She says this because spring is her favorite time of the year. During this season, nature comes alive, and the beauty of the blooming hibiscus fills her with joy. So, she believes she will feel more confident taking the test at that time. For example, when she talks about the Madagascar hibiscus that grows through bricks, it's evident that she loves hibiscuses deeply. Therefore, she wants to take the test when she feels at her best, surrounded by the vibrant energy of spring.
378	9241	4	3	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to clearly let readers know that Saeng is a survivor, much like the resilient hibiscus. Saeng has not fully adapted to America yet and often feels out of place. However, this plant reminds her of her home, bringing back warm memories and a sense of comfort. The hibiscus symbolizes her strength and the ability to persevere in a new and unfamiliar environment.
379	9242	4	3	The author finishes it with this because spring time is truly a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test, she yearns to start over in the spring, just like the flowers that emerge anew after the cold winter. She takes solace in knowing that even though the hibiscus is currently dying, it will grow back in the spring. Spring is a time of renewal, where babies are born, flowers are in full bloom, and a fresh start is taking shape. It represents hope and the opportunity for Saeng to overcome her past failure and achieve success.
380	9243	4	3	The author concludes the sentence this way because they are trying to vividly show that Saeng is a very determined girl. No matter how many times she fails, she always tries again and again until she gets it right. By doing this, the author is effectively showing what Saeng firmly believes in, which is that no matter how big or hard the challenge is, she will keep on going until she finishes what she started. Moving to a new place was extremely hard for her. She faced a very hard time communicating with people and simply trying to make friends because it's not always easy being the new one. Moving made her view things differently as everything was so unfamiliar to her. But as time went by, she gradually got the hang of it. This shows that as long as one tries, they can be successful, and that's precisely what the author was trying to convey by concluding the story in this way.
381	9244	4	3	"In the story, a young girl named Saeng takes a test, but unfortunately, she has failed. She is determined to retake it next spring. That's why the last paragraph says, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author concludes the story with this ending. In the story, it talks about the hibiscus flowers. So, since she failed the test, instead of simply saying she will retake it next spring, they say when the hibiscus flowers bud, which at that time will be spring."
382	9245	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to let the readers clearly know that the daughter Saeng would come back with determination and take the test again. She has a deep love for the garden. Therefore, the beauty and renewal that spring brings in the garden will always stay in her mind, and she will not forget what spring did for her, which gives her the hope and strength to face the test again.
383	9246	4	3	It clearly shows that she has a profound love for her plants. The story carefully tells you about all of the plants and how she genuinely likes them. She firmly thinks they are all unique in their own ways, and she truly enjoys the company of the plants more than school or anything else in her life. This love for plants is an important part of her character.
384	9247	4	3	"Minfong, who concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph, does so because it vividly shows Saeng's strong determination to succeed in her new country despite the numerous obstacles she faces. The winter hibiscus serves as a powerful reminder for Saeng to be as strong as the hibiscus that endures the harsh winter. In Saeng's case, it means having the strength to pass the driving test. The text states, ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus...."" (Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes that she must also be ""strong"" like the ""winter hibiscus."" She also realizes that she is gradually beginning to adapt to the new country as she wrote, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become almost familiar..."" (Ho @NUM1). Saeng knows that she is capable of adapting and is determined to achieve success. The author concludes, ""..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1). The ""spring"" will be Saeng's time of new hope and achievement."
385	9248	4	3	"In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to convey that when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning, Saeng will also start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, ""Look how root - bound it is, poor thing."" This example vividly shows how the plant was in a very bad state, almost dying when she bought it. Another example would be, ""I - I failed the test."" This example clearly tells how she feels extremely down about failing the test. So, in @CAPS1, both the flower was at its ""breaking point"" and Saeng was in a similar low - point. The paragraph tells how @CAPS2 was going to take a well - deserved break and patiently wait for the flower to become stronger until she takes the test again, showing her connection with the flower's revival and her own comeback."
386	9249	4	3	The author added the last paragraph because Saeng's vow helps the reader understand Saeng and her pain, but also her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to return to normal again, it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home, where she thinks is normal, the landscape is covered with beautiful flowers, just like in spring. The snow melting would be the pain gradually going away. The geese returning would symbolize that Saeng knows things will get better, just as she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better and she can move forward with a more positive outlook.
387	9250	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl Saeng was in a dilemma. She wanted to take the test again to prove herself, but also wanted her hibiscus, which was very dear to her, to stay strong and to keep growing healthily. So, after some thought, she said, ""I will take the test again when my hibiscus starts to bloom again."" This way, she found a balance between her personal goal and her affection for the plant, showing her careful consideration and determination in this new situation."
388	9251	4	3	"Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho explores one's quest for acceptance and adaptation to changes in life. Saeng is the young protagonist in the story who is dealing with her recent move to America from her homeland in Asia. After failing a test, which was quite a setback for her, Saeng spends a considerable amount of money on a flower, perhaps as a way to comfort herself. When she consoles with her mother, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the quest for adaptation. Single - handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of America, even though she will always remember her homeland with fondness and carry those memories with her as she moves forward."
389	9252	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because Ron is truly in love with the plant and uses it as a kind of clock to tell her when she can take the test. Since it's known that if you're not a @CAPS1.S citizen, you can only take the driver's test once a year. So, relying on the plant's growth as a sign is her way of patiently waiting for the right time to retake the test, making the most of the limited opportunity she has.
390	9253	4	3	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do something good for herself. The reason I said this is because in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”, which clearly means she is taking charge of her own situation and wants what is best for herself. By making this vow, she is setting a goal and a time frame for herself, showing her self - determination and the ability to make positive choices in the face of challenges, which is an important step in her journey of adaptation and self - growth.
391	9254	4	3	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test, she won't be able to transition to a new country as she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants, vividly remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes...” She remembers and misses everything she had; she yearns for her country, her grandmother, and her old life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappointed her mother with the cost, but her mother understands the pain. The narration states “It's a beautiful plant,” she finally said sadly, “you got it.” Eventually, Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived, and she made a promise to herself. The narration states “and if this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows that she draws strength from the plant's resilience to face her challenges anew.
392	9255	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending is used to show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can thrive, then so can she. In the story, after the author failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home and connected her to her past, making her feel less alone. For example, when the author says “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her,” that shows that she misses her home and the flower gave her a way to deeply connect to her memories. Also, when she says “like the geese in the distinctive V against the sky,” that shows that the geese were kind of like her; they were moving to a different place to start a new life. This makes her feel that if they can adapt and change, so will she over time. In conclusion, the ending was to further emphasize her complex feelings towards her hometown and the new town she lives in, highlighting her hope for a better future.
393	9256	4	3	The author ends the story like this to illustrate the concepts of adapting, changing, or starting everything all over again. For example, the geese fly away when it gets cold, but they always come back, giving their home another chance. The hibiscus is another fine example; it buds in a specific season, usually spring, always but doesn't die in winter. It always returns. Saeng has obviously realized this and vowed to try her driver's test again because she believes it might work this time. The author was trying to spread the message of “don't give up.” By using these natural examples, the author encourages readers to persevere through difficulties.
394	9257	4	3	Determination, help, strength – all are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a key factor why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her driver's test the first time, and she wants to wait and do it again. She is determined to take different steps, such as more practice and better preparation, in order to pass the test. Secondly, I believe that help is a crucial reason why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test, and she believes that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and also help her to do other things in her new life. The author is proving that she'll go back and she'll be ready. Finally, strength is the last important reason why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng believes that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she'll be stronger than she was before. These are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph, highlighting the power of these elements in overcoming challenges.
395	9258	4	3	Mingfong Ho concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going through hard times; moving to the United States and failing her driver's test. In the greenhouse, Saeng even breaks down and cries. The hibiscus flower that Saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng, it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds again, it would be the right time to take her driver's test. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. This parallel shows that just like the flower, Saeng has the potential to grow and thrive in her new environment.
396	9259	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to vividly show how Saeng underwent a notable change. Initially, Saeng didn't want to take the test and she had absolutely no confidence in herself. Throughout the story, Saeng's mother whole - heartedly supports her no matter what the situation is. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it strongly reminded her of her home. Now that Saeng has been comforted by her mother's understanding, she feels more relaxed and is fully ready and much more confident to take the test again. Therefore, it is evident that Saeng has changed for the better.
397	9260	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author deliberately chose this ending to show that one needs to keep faith firmly in their heart. Saeng was still a bit deeply homesick throughout the story. This homesickness could have possibly had a significant impact on how she performed on her driving test. If one waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely gradually drift away, and she would be able to fully focus on meeting her goal of passing the driving test. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge toll on her, especially if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author might have chosen this ending is that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring comes around kind of lifted your hopes up for her, showing that there is still a bright future ahead.
398	9261	4	3	The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is clearly saying that she could not concentrate on the test due to her strong longing to go back to her home country. The deep - seated yearning for her homeland was constantly on her mind during the test, making it extremely difficult for her to focus on the task at hand. This explains why she might have not performed well on the test, and the author uses this ending to convey this important aspect of her emotional state.
399	9262	4	3	The author probably ended with this to clearly show the feeling that Saeng will surely return and help out again. From the story, it can be inferred that Saeng must really like to plant. She probably might help her mom with a lot more things now that she can clearly see what the act of helping might lead to. Helping her mom could bring a sense of fulfillment and connection to her new life, and this realization will likely encourage her to be more involved in household tasks and gardening in the future.
400	9263	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story with Saeng's thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding skillfully ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the precious memories it brings back to her. But she wouldn't have gone to the shop if she had passed the test. This connection creates a full understanding of the relationship between the test and the hibiscus. It also shows the great importance of the hibiscus in the story. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are clearly out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they rightfully belong to a new and unfamiliar place. In some ways, Saeng is very much like the flower. She must adapt to her new home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its harsh surroundings in order to survive. When she knows the flower has survived the harsh winter, she will finally realize that she can also survive living in @LOCATION2. This realization would make her feel strong and focused, ready to face the challenges of her new life.
401	9264	4	3	In *Winter Hibiscus* by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a heartfelt vow by the main character, Saeng. Saeng silently pledges to retake her driver’s test when spring arrives, when the gentle warmth of the season melts the lingering snows, the geese return in their graceful flight, and her hibiscus plant begins to show delicate buds. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it infuses a sense of hope into the otherwise sad narrative. It strongly suggests that Saeng will be okay and will gradually move past her deep - seated longing for the country of her birth. “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Saeng was utterly sad and miserable. Every single flower in that greenhouse vividly reminded her of her home country. She was deeply depressed and consumed by homesickness. When she got home, with determination in her heart, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground. She knew that when it would bloom in the spring, it would symbolize a new life and another chance. It clearly meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded *Winter Hibiscus* on a positive note with the last paragraph, leaving the readers with a glimmer of optimism.
402	9265	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow - in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese return in their familiar V - formation, and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again - is to leave a sense of suspense. The author implies that Saeng ate all the plant previously, perhaps out of desperation or some emotional turmoil. So, the idea is that next year, when the hibiscus is growing healthily, she will focus on taking the test instead of succumbing to whatever led her to eat the plant before. This is precisely why the author ended the story with that thought - provoking paragraph, leaving the readers to ponder Saeng's future and her journey of self - improvement.
403	9266	4	3	The author concludes the story with this well - crafted paragraph. For example, it gives the story a truly good and happily - ever - after - like ending. The carefully chosen words and the overall tone of the paragraph bring a sense of closure and contentment. It leaves the readers with a feeling of satisfaction, as if all the loose ends have been neatly tied up. In this way, the author ensures that the story lingers in the readers' minds as a positive and memorable experience, making the conclusion an integral part of the overall narrative.
404	9267	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to genuinely feel like the protagonist, Saeng, is going to accomplish something significant because of the symbolic presence of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her potential accomplishment because of the hibiscus is when the author tenderly mentions how she and her grandmother used to spend precious time together. They would do various things as a pair, like sitting in the garden. Her grandmother would lovingly do her hair and then gently put a vibrant hibiscus flower into it. This memory is a powerful link to her past and a source of strength. Also, the geese are a clear sign of accomplishment. She sees them in the vast sky, flying south in an organized formation so they can survive the harsh cold winter months in a warm place. Just like the geese, Saeng is on a journey of survival and achievement, and the author uses these symbols to convey her potential for success.
405	9268	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because he is straightforwardly telling how the story ends. The underlying reason behind that is so people clearly know what happens to the characters and how the plot resolves. By providing this conclusion, the author gives the readers a sense of closure. It allows them to understand the final outcome of all the events and the fates of the characters. This way, the readers can fully process the story and take away the intended message, making the conclusion an essential part of the storytelling experience.
406	9269	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saeng's problem is the ""wave of loss"" that sweeps over her when she has memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saeng's depressing struggle to find joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test that Saeng failed. After a story filled with such depression, the author shows Saeng's newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph, leaving the readers with a sense of hope for her future."
407	9270	4	3	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to let the readers of the story know that she is not willing to give up and that she is determined to take the test again and pass it. By ending the story in this way, she conveys her resilience and positive attitude, inspiring the readers with her spirit.
408	9271	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she has adapted to her new home. Also, it concludes the story so it shows the reader her last thoughts. So it's like it's the last thing, and the subject that you think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending not only reflects her adjustment to the new environment but also her forward - looking mindset."
409	9272	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to see what people would say about the story's ending. By leaving it in this way, he hopes to spark discussions and gather different opinions from the readers, which can offer him insights into how his work is perceived.
410	9273	4	3	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how Saeng's mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and there would be a while before the spring comes back, Saeng has a lot of planning to do for the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return, symbolizing new beginnings and the cycle of life, which gives Saeng a sense of purpose and hope for the future.
411	9274	4	3	In the story, I think the author concludes that paragraph with the story because Saeng is clearly stating that when she comes back or when she next sees the hibiscus bloom again, she will then take the test. Until then, she genuinely feels out of place. She believes she is of no use to the arrangements she is living in now and feels uncomfortable. She thinks that she will not be able to do well until she is in her “bloom’s town,” a place where it is harmonious for her, a place that truly feels like home to her.
412	9275	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it shows that she will go back to the one special place where she can find solace. There, she will not break down as she did before. Instead, she will grieve over what she has lost in a more composed way and learn to deal with the changes that life has thrown at her. This ending allows the character to find a sense of closure and move forward with a newfound strength.
413	9276	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows, plants die and won't grow back until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. Then, she will see how her garden will be in the spring. This natural cycle represents hope and renewal. Therefore, the author put this paragraph at the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States, they have never been happier. They enjoy being together, having dinner, and planting together. They truly had the time of their lives planting all the time, creating memories and a sense of home in a new land.
414	9277	4	3	If you have ever had to move from your hometown or country, you know how comforting something can be that's from your old country and in your new one. The fact that Saeng had geese, plants, and everything else from her home country comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story, it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story, it vividly illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the greenhouse. Many times in the story, you could always “hear” that sense of love when she would call a plant by its native language's name. Throughout the story, you could always sense the deep love and caring she had for these reminders of home. The author knows how much she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore, that's why he concluded the story as such, to show the power of these connections in helping her face the future.
415	9278	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potential of the hibiscus. So, Saeng will go take the test again, regardless of the fact that she already took it and failed. She is like the hibiscus. The hibiscus seems out of place in the cold and snow but is determined to survive when the snow melts. It endures the harsh conditions with resilience. Similarly, Saeng will go take the test again and use the hibiscus as her motivation, drawing strength from its tenacity to face the challenges ahead and achieve success.
416	9279	4	3	The author had concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond closely with gardening. Among the various things the author has said about Saeng and Saeng’s mother, the author shows a way they have bonded. I think it was fairly neat the way the author had crafted out this story. It was a fairly interesting story as it kept you guessing, on the edge of your seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were such great friends. It was a nice thing to see the daughter and the mother being so in tune with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he has a great mind and a good way of thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother, and it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives, filled with hope and new beginnings.
417	9280	4	3	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother truly happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some important reason, perhaps to help with family errands or reach a new job. Maybe it’s because it cost her a significant amount of money to keep taking it, and she wants to avoid further expense. She really likes her hibiscus though, and it might be a source of comfort and inspiration for her as she looks forward to retaking the test. In conclusion, these possible reasons all contribute to the complexity of the story's ending and Saeng's motivations.
418	9281	4	3	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined individual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring, and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new beginning. The last paragraph is like a powerful symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was deeply upset about failing the test. “She said, ‘I–I failed the test.’” By stuttering, it clearly shows she was extremely upset. Since she was so distraught, giving it time until she takes the test again is a wise decision. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start, ready to face the challenge with renewed determination.
419	9282	4	3	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some deep - seated sense of relief with the flower. It also shows that Saeng wasn't going to give up easily and she was going to keep trying with unwavering determination. At first, she was extremely sad and upset, but when she saw the flower that vividly reminded her of home, she became happy and didn't feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a profound and deep impact on her because it reminded her of home. When she started thinking about her grandmother, she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it truly meant to her, and she felt a warm comfort from the flower. I feel the author concludes the story in a very good positive way, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future.
420	9283	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is having a really hard time adjusting to her new life. By waiting until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself sufficient time to adapt and heal from the disappointment of failure. The paragraph shows Saeng’s remarkable courage and strong hope about retaking the test. In the end, this ending leaves us believing that Saeng will overcome her challenges and succeed in her next attempt.
421	9284	4	3	Honestly, I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she feels assured now, having found a sense of stability in her current situation. Maybe it's a mental trial we all must face, a test of our inner strength and resilience. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too, a sign that nature itself is going through a cycle of renewal and growth, and we are meant to follow suit. In the end, these are just possibilities, but they offer some insight into the complex emotions and experiences we all encounter.
422	9285	4	3	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to effectively get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is extremely attached to the hibiscus plant because for her, it vividly represents her homeland and all the cherished things she left behind. This last line represents many profound things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all clearly indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact that Saeng wants to retake her test shows how with perseverance, obstacles can be overcome, and goals can be successfully achieved, which ties in perfectly with the overall theme of the story.
423	9286	4	3	The author concludes the story this way because that's the way he wants for the girl to end it. The girl is all about those flowers, plants, and animals. She has a particular fondness for Madagascar periwinkle. The places where she used to live are lush with plants, animals, and colorful flowers. This connection to nature is clearly an important part of her character, and it makes sense that the story would end in a way that reflects this aspect of her life.
424	9287	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with a paragraph that powerfully showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was firmly determined to pass the test. For example, the text states “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. It shows that even though she failed it once, she isn't going to let that setback stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example, the text states “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. It shows that she does not regret buying the hibiscus as it has become a symbol of hope and new beginnings for her. This determination and positive outlook bode well for her future.
425	9288	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” this way because she is creating a strong sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her driver's test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms, which will mark a new chapter of growth and happiness for her.
426	9289	4	3	She wanted to catch those geese, and that was the whole goal and purpose of her hunting. She was intent on trying to catch geese as she had seen her grandparents attempt to do it. In conclusion, this is why she made that last statement, expressing her determination to achieve her goal.
427	9290	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she wants the readers to understand that she didn't give up on the plant and that she's determined. For example, the story states that Saeng said “I - I failed the test,” and she felt as though she didn't accomplish what she wanted to. So, at the end of the story, she firmly said “I will take that test again.” This shows what kind of person she is, and she's not going to just give up just because she failed the first time, highlighting her perseverance.
428	9291	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring time everything is reborn, and in the spring time Saeng will be well - used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This means that with every passing season she gets more used to her new home, and it becomes more like a part of her. Another is when the author says “she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.” This vividly reminds her of her old home while watching the geese, tying her past and present together.
429	9292	4	3	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from Vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the new location spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second - to - last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, the geese, and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and it shows that when everything familiar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the new place, she will continue to try driving and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the new location has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles in the new country and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaptation throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds Saeng of her old home. In an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is indeed hope for Saeng and her family to thrive in the new environment.
430	9293	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a caring person towards nature. I know this because of this quote, “one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.” This quote clearly shows that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that shows Saeng is caring towards nature is, “she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.” This shows that Saeng is very gentle and caring towards a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion, the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show that Saeng is a caring person towards nature, emphasizing this important aspect of her character.
431	9294	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to clearly explain the deep significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus holds great importance to her and her rich cultural heritage. Whenever there are hibiscus around, Saeng genuinely feels that she can overcome any challenge and do anything. That very sense of confidence was lacking when she took the test initially, which is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is firmly stating that the next time she takes the test, she will draw the much - needed strength from the hibiscus to help her successfully pass the test.
432	9295	4	3	This shows that she has not given up and is determined to try hard to adapt and do well in this new land. It leaves a sad story off with a truly happy ending. The hibiscus is a clear sign of hope, and so is the vibrant season of spring. This makes the entire thing full of positive meaning. Without this part, the story would simply be a sad one, but with it, it becomes a tale of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a crucial turning point or an end to all the previous hardships. It is a sort of resolution without a typical, straightforward resolution, yet it still brings a sense of closure and optimism.
433	9296	4	3	The author concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that heartache and confusion, she clearly knows it will take a considerable amount of time to adjust. She realizes that she'll be fully ready given enough time to heal and start afresh, just like a plant that has endured a harsh season and then begins to grow anew. This realization gives a sense of hope and a promise of a better future, as the plant symbolizes renewal and the ability to overcome difficult circumstances.
434	9297	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to set a clear goal for herself in the future. She has a strong desire to pass the test, and she is determined to try hard to achieve this goal next year. For example, her mother was initially mad that she didn't pass the test, but then soon forgot about it. However, Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She made a solemn vow to the hibiscus because she has a deep - seated love for that plant and is willing to do anything to honor it and achieve her goal with its inspiration.
435	9298	4	3	The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succeed, one must persevere and keep trying. Saeng will gradually adapt to her new country in due time, but not if she spends her precious time constantly wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a powerful reminder to her of starting anew and adapting to the new society. Saeng will retry her driver’s test when the plant buds again, signifying the start of its life cycle all over again. This cycle of renewal in the plant mirrors Saeng's own journey of starting fresh and making a new beginning in her life in the new country.
436	9299	4	3	She is saying that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So, as she is taking her test, she can watch the geese flying in the sky and the hibiscus starting to bud. By having these natural scenes around her, she hopes to stay calm and focused and try her best to pass it.
437	9300	4	3	The author ended this story with this paragraph because that's how Saeng felt. She felt deeply connected to the geese and the hibiscus. As described, “She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive form was etched,” and it was almost familiar to her now. She has decided to retake the test in the spring. The presence of the hibiscus and the blooming flowers in the spring will make her feel better and more confident, and she believes she should pass the test this time.
438	9301	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to vividly show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted itself in Saeng’s life and gave her a newly - found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver’s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This clearly shows the deep connection between Saeng and the hibiscus, and it is this strong connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently walked into a flower shop and was able to identify all the flowers there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers, and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting to her new life. Another example is when in the text it states, “She realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before had become…almost familiar to her now.” Saeng comes to this realization by listening intently to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower, which normally thrived at her old home, would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big [@CAPS1] here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng crucial support, courage, and even strength to face new challenges.
439	9302	4	3	“When they come back,” Saeng vowed silently to herself. “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” So, this means when they come back, she has to make up for the test so they don’t have to worry about it later. During their trip, they saw a lot of different things. The soil was cold and hard, and they couldn’t do much with it. She thought it was like walking into another world, a hot, moist world exploding with greenery. [@CAPS1] friends and countless shades and shapes of plants grew in seemingly random profusion. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing hard, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that grew through the cracks of the sidewalk. So, clearly, they saw a lot of things on their trip. They saw things they had never seen before, like the weeds growing through the sidewalk.
440	9303	4	3	I think the author includes this to clearly show the character's unwavering determination to pass this test no matter what obstacles or difficulties may come their way. This determination is a key aspect that the author wants to convey to the readers, highlighting the character's strong will and resolve.
441	9304	4	3	The author might conclude the story with this because it clearly shows that the girl had unwavering confidence that when the flower blooms, she will surely be able to pass. Back at her home - land, that flower held great significance for her, and it still retains that importance. But it seems like this flower not only gives her hope but also a sense of pride. She used to gently pick it with her beloved grandmother and carefully put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, vivid memories of her grandmother come to mind, and that will strongly motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can bravely stand through the harsh winter weather, so the girl is firmly determined that when the flower blooms, she will be able to pass the test, marking a new chapter of success in her life.
442	9305	4	3	The author concludes the story with “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because she had a strong desire to grow hibiscus even in the challenging winter time. She had unfortunately failed the first time and was extremely eager to redeem herself and succeed the second time around. She didn't want to experience failure again, so she took extra precautions and did some things differently. She carefully planted the hibiscus with great care, then gently patted the soil down firmly around the plant, ensuring it had a good start. That is precisely why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, highlighting her determination and new - found approach.
443	9306	4	3	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms, which clearly shows that she deeply misses her country and still wants to be connected to it somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms, it's as if she is receiving support from her homeland. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth mirrors that of the plant. When she first got it, she wasn't fully ready to go out and actively do things. She still hadn't completely adapted to the new environment, just like the hibiscus wasn't adapted to the weather and had to patiently wait till @DATE1 to bloom. This connection between her and the plant shows how intertwined her personal growth and her longing for home are.
444	9307	4	3	"“then I will take that test again” [@NUM1] Saeng’s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. However, ""I - @CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together in a poignant way. She yearned for comfort as she earnestly seeked the “@CAPS2 Malik” [Ho, @NUM3] for solace. Seeing this brought back all the warm and vivid memories of her life “back home” [@NUM1] that kept her spirits high. As a result, a strong bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day filled with hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to firmly say, “when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” showing her renewed determination."
445	9308	4	3	The author ended this story with this sentence because it's an excellent conclusion. It's a good conclusion because it neatly closes by clearly telling what she will do. This is beneficial because it shows that Saeng had finally come to the realization that she needs to take that test even though she has a deep - seated love for nature so much. It represents a step forward in her character development, as she is willing to balance her passion for nature with the practical need to take the test, thus rounding off the story in a satisfying way.
446	9309	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeg is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to show that Saeg was not going to give up, meaning that when the thing that was most important to her was completed, she would then take the test again. In the story, it says that ""Saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus, which was what was important to her."" This indicates her focus and determination for the future."
447	9310	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"", it ends with the line, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author understands the need to work hard and realizes that sometimes one needs to start over. For example, some students who fail the second semester look at winter break as a chance for a fresh start, just like Saeng is waiting for spring to retake her test. This shows the cycle of renewal and the hope for a better outcome."
448	9311	4	3	The author ends the story with the paragraph because it is winter time, and due to the heavy snow, she can not do anything significant. The snow has made it impossible for her to take the test immediately, so she has to wait until the spring. Spring brings more favorable conditions, allowing her to be in a better position to attempt the test. This waiting period also gives her time to prepare and gather the necessary confidence.
449	9312	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story, Saeng is often stuck dwelling on past memories rather than making new ones. For instance, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts reminiscing about old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled ""jasmine"", she thinks of her grandmother who passed away and remembers how her grandmother used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is ""not a real one"" and she also says it's ""not like the kind we had before."" Evidently, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. However, when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows significant growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again. This marks a positive turning point in her character development."
450	9313	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story is coming to an end. The author adds that sweet touch by suggesting that it will become strong again and the beautiful flowers will blossom. By doing so, the author is letting the readers know that nature will continue its cycle, and the seasons will come back around. This gives a sense of hope and continuity, leaving the readers with a positive feeling about the passage of time and the resilience of life.
451	9314	4	3	This paragraph @NUM1 is crafted to let the reader clearly know it's winter. You can easily tell it's winter because in the passage, it specifically says when the snow melts, which is a distinct sign associated with the winter season. This indicates that the events in the paragraph are set during this cold time of the year.
452	9315	4	3	Tisaeng had unfortunately failed her driver's test. After that setback, she went to a place that seemed to be a floral - related area and bought a plant. It was the “dok faeng ñ noi”. She held very fond memories about this plant. She vividly remembered it from her time in Vietnam, where it used to be everywhere all the time, adding a touch of familiarity to her new environment. She had bought “@CAPS1 hibiscus” as a source of comfort to herself. The last paragraph says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and then return @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a chance, believing that better times are ahead.
453	9316	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is done to clearly show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the natural environment around her, she is constantly going through changes. In the spring, all those things that couldn't be at their best during the harsh winter begin to thrive. Similarly, Saeng will also thrive. And when she starts thriving and feels like her old self again, she'll be fully ready to take the driving test and pass it. She'll have returned to her old self just as the geese return home. When she's done crying, much like the snow is done melting, and when she's ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begins budding, she'll be in the perfect state to take the test and achieve success.
454	9317	4	3	All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author skillfully gives the feeling of hope and comfort that Saeng obtains when she thinks about the past. To continue this sense of hope, the last sentence gives a strong indication that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For instance, at the start of the story, Saeng was feeling alienated, alone, and completely misplaced in her new country. However, as the story progresses, she starts to develop a sense of peace of mind and certainty that her future will be brighter. This is due to the passing of time and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author effectively uses the last sentence to give a clear feeling of hope for Saeng's future and her ever - growing confidence, suggesting a positive outlook for her life.
455	9318	4	3	The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus can reseed and go through all the challenges and conditions in its environment to become a beautiful flower for the year. After blooming, it will then repeat the process of growth, blooming, and potentially reseeding again. This cycle represents the resilience and continuous nature of life, much like the character Saeng's journey in the story.
456	9319	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to vividly show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring, a well - known symbol, represents birth and renewal, offering a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be a crucial test, perhaps her citizenship test. This failure motivated her to try and recall her past, a past she deeply misses. The winter hibiscus seems to be a metaphor for herself. As the text illustrates: “it’s - it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled, still too shaky to say the words at home, fearing she might burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” her mother said quietly. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters.” This description fits Saeng’s situation perfectly. She is not as happy as she once was, but she can endure the hard times and bloom in the spring to take the test again. This clearly shows the purpose of the last paragraph in “Winter Hibiscus” is to convey the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.
457	9320	4	3	I think that this sentence was chosen to be the last sentence because it clearly shows that despite being far from her homeland, Saeng still has the ability to pass the test. Even though she is in a new place, her inner strength remains intact. As the plant that reminds her of home returns and begins to grow steadily, Saeng will follow the same path of growth and progress. I believe it is an excellent sentence to end with as it not only gives a sense of hope but also leaves the reader wondering if she will indeed pass the test, creating a lingering sense of anticipation.
458	9321	4	3	She ends the story with that because the flower holds great significance for her. It gives her the strength to face the challenges of a new place and fills her with hope. It also reminds her of the warm and familiar home she left behind. Back at her home, these flowers were everywhere, so when she saw one here, she had to buy it. She carefully planted it, hoping it would grow through the harsh winter. After winter passed, the flower grew huge, a sign of resilience. And just like the flower, she passed her driver test. As a well - deserved reward, her mom got her a real Vietnam flower, further connecting her to her roots.
459	9322	4	3	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she realizes she was wrong in her actions and genuinely wants to make amends with her mother. By doing so, she is also showing her mother how much she truly appreciates and likes nature. Through this conclusion, it becomes evident that she is taking steps towards self - improvement and strengthening her relationship with her mother, using her love for nature as a bridge to heal the rift.
460	9323	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time. The disappointment must have been hard to bear, but she was determined. She kept saying to herself that she would take the test again, showing her resilience and refusal to give up. This conclusion leaves the reader with a sense of her determination and the possibility of a successful outcome in her next attempt at the driving test.
461	9324	4	3	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another arduous @DATE1 or a phase of intense hard work in carefully planting the flowers, which required patience and dedication. This was likely a way to emphasize the challenges she faced in this process.
462	9325	4	3	The author concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” the way she did because she wanted to show Saeng’s determination. At one point in the story, the author wrote, “she was still too shaky to say the words at home”. Saeng really missed her old life and her old country deeply. She often wonders longingly when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself fully, because she still has significant trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that Saeng could be shown as a person who would not easily give up. Although she’d had previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for Saeng to gradually adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when Saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives new hope. Saeng told her mother, “I failed the test”, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to Saeng and the reader, that she will work harder and do better in the spring. The author shows Saeng’s determination to rise above failure and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in “Winter Hibiscus” is used to effectively show Saeng’s determination.
463	9326	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she feels a deep connection to live the geese and her memories are closely related to the times she sees the geese flying in the sky. I think that her test is in school, but she has a strong belief that she’ll pass it by vividly remembering her precious memories. She feels connected to the outside world. For example, she loves the colorful flowers that bloom in the garden. That’s why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey this sense of connection and hope.
464	9327	4	3	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, with a very spiritual and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, “Saeng”, a foreign Chinese citizen, is deeply touched and fascinated by all the majestic plants and beautiful nature that was thriving in the green house. She ventures eagerly to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences with nostalgia. As she walks slowly through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees softly, “Saebba”, Saeng whispered, “Madagascar periwinkle”, its tag pronounced clearly. “How strange to see it in a pot”, Saeng thought. “Back home it just grew wild!” But as her tour in the green house grew with time, she soon realizes she is missing some of her cherished memories, and begins to cry sorrowfully. As she reaches home she is greeted by her mother. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng said, with a voice full of disappointment. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment, and cheers her up with the idea of planting the “hibiscus”. In the end, the author shows strong expression by writing one last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance to start anew.
465	9328	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is basically saying he’s absolutely never taking that test again. The author is clearly showing that the character does not like this test at all. The test might be difficult, time - consuming, or just not in line with the character's interests. And the character would rather not take it ever again to avoid the associated stress and disappointment.
466	9329	4	3	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This well - crafted paragraph delves into the theme of overcoming obstacles and directly encourages the reader to try again. It emphasizes the crucial principle that it is important to never give up and to keep persevering until you succeed. In the story, Saeng had recently moved away from Vietnam and deeply missed her homeland. To make matters worse, she failed her driver's test, which left her really upset. One day, she saw a group of geese flying above her. Inspired by this sight, she said that when the geese come back in the spring and her new plant starts to grow, she will retake her driver's test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter; the cold weather is a significant obstacle for them. Similarly, her new plant can't grow until it gets warm. Her plant has to overcome being small and vulnerable until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time in their lives, and you have to keep trying in order to get around them and achieve your goals.
467	9330	4	3	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” ends the way it does because the narrator realizes that with the arrival of spring simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over, a true rebirth. One passage from the text that clearly shows the narrator’s hope is, “Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season, were almost familiar to her now” (Ho @NUM1). This passage of text shows that she realized that a lot of things that seemed meaningless to her before suddenly had a purpose. She came to understand that there is a new rebirth in the spring. The conclusion sentences state that she is going to retake the test in the spring. She now realizes that she has a whole new opportunity and a new life to start afresh. The conclusion sentence of “Winter Hibiscus” is one of realization of the opportunity that comes with the beginning of spring, a time of renewal and hope.
468	9331	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. There are many valid reasons and vivid examples that support this. One reason is that the author wants to show the change in Saeng after her first driving test and when she bought the flower to relieve her distress. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng went to the florist. When she saw this plant, memories of her childhood came back, and she temporarily forgot about her failed test. This flower became a powerful source of motivation for her to get her license. Another reason is that it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing the test, she came back with determination, saying, “... I will take the test again.” In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to clearly show how confident Saeng has become through her experience with the plant.
469	9332	4	3	The author concludes that statement at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng won't give up just like the hibiscus. For example, the hibiscus does its absolute best to survive in the harsh winter conditions and then blooms and starts over in the warm spring. Saeng will also endure the difficult “winter” of her failure and start all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author wanted to show the readers that Saeng is like the hibiscus in the sense that she has to start over and retry what she has failed, just as if the hibiscus had seemingly “died” in the winter but then comes back to life in the spring. This comparison highlights Saeng's resilience and the hope for a new beginning.
470	9333	4	3	My response is that if a story is about winter, then really it is going to be about the activities and experiences of walking around in the winter and having fun and all those sorts of things. Winter offers a unique setting with snow - covered landscapes, cold yet crisp air, and various winter - specific activities. People might go ice - skating, build snowmen, or simply take a leisurely stroll to enjoy the beauty of the season. So, a story about winter is likely to revolve around these winter - related joys and adventures.
471	9334	4	3	The author concludes the story in such a manner to make the reader more interested and to convey that the events described will repeat year after year, creating a sense of cyclical inevitability.
472	9335	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he intends to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I arrived at this response was that throughout the story, @PERSON1 was constantly either gardening the hibiscus or had one nearby. This clearly indicated to me that she was inspired by this flower and its beauty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to emphasize the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng, as it was a consistent source of inspiration for her.
473	9336	4	3	The author ends the story in this way because it represents the new birth that will take place. It's almost as if she's saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng “realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She is saying that when the new season begins, it will mark her own beginning, and she'll have a different and more positive outlook on her new life, ready to embrace the changes ahead.
474	9337	4	3	The author ends the story this way to neatly wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and detailed descriptions of it. This was done so that the reader would get a vivid image in their head of how “beautiful or calming” spring is supposed to be, enhancing the overall mood and message of the story.
475	9338	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it suggests that her strength will come when the flowers come, and with that new - found strength, she will be able to take the test with confidence and determination.
476	9339	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story in that paragraph because she wants to vividly show the determination the young girl in the story possesses. At first, the girl, unable to resist, bought the expensive flower. She deeply did not want her mother to be disappointed though. So, she was firmly determined to ""pass the test."" In the spring, when it is the appropriate time to buy more seeds, the girl earnestly wants to be able to buy the seeds. Thus, the author is effectively showing the trait of determination that the girl holds within herself, highlighting her unwavering spirit."
477	9340	4	3	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the hibiscus budding would beautifully symbolize starting over. Saeng taking the test again is giving her a precious chance to start over fresh and try once more. Just like the hibiscus does not stop budding despite the challenges, Saeng should not stop trying. This conclusion emphasizes the message of resilience and the hope for a new beginning.
478	9341	4	3	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to clearly say that the hibiscus is the powerful symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, Saeng's mother says “Its flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This is a poignant symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to endure the cold months, in which the weather is extremely rough. In Saeng’s case, she is a brave girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the driver's test again when the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is precisely why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph, leaving a lasting impression of hope and perseverance.
479	9342	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to effectively convey a strong sense of determination of Saeng wanting to complete what she started. She had failed the driver's test and was very disappointed. For instance, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she vividly remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family, etc. She can closely relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again. As new beginnings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus, full of hope and potential. A fresh start with the driver's test, showing her indomitable will to succeed.
480	9343	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the advice that Saeng didn't give up, so you shouldn't either. I think that this paragraph is describing a law of life which is “Don't give up.” Even though she had failed at first, she is still whole - heartedly willing to try again. This conclusion serves as an inspiring reminder that perseverance is key in the face of difficulties, and we should follow Saeng's example and keep going.
481	9344	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the gentle spring, when the thick snows gradually melt, the geese gracefully return, and this delicate hibiscus is just budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldn't casually push things off. You should always deal with them promptly as they come up. So in the story, the girl is showing a bad example of procrastination. I believe the author wanted to make a clear point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do as it tries to show the correct way of handling and approaching these certain things in life.
482	9345	4	3	She should and truly needs to learn that you can't simply replace a plant with an identical - looking one and expect it to be exactly as equal to the original in every way. Each plant has its own unique characteristics, growth patterns, and the memories associated with it. She needs to learn this valuable lesson in life so that she can better understand the essence of things and not be overly simplistic in her expectations.
483	9346	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow the natural rhythm and try to smoothly fit into her new land. Saeng has unfortunately failed her driver’s test and deeply feels out of place in her new home. The text states, “As Saebba nedae tall and lush. And surrounded there garden” (No 1). When she sees the @CAPS1, it vividly reminds her of her old home where she felt a sense of belonging. Now she wants to patiently wait to see that flower grow so that when she takes the driver’s test again, she will be more confident. Also, she sees geese majestically fly over her head when she plants her flower. The author writes, “…She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become…almost familiar to her now.” (No @NUM1). The geese coming back in the spring will now also serve as a gentle reminder of her new name and how she must try to live there happily now. In the last paragraph, the author writes, “I will take that test again” (No @NUM1). This gives the strong feeling of Saeng trying to start a brand - new beginning in this new home, embracing the changes and opportunities it offers.
484	9347	4	3	This is a truly powerful sentence that effectively demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is firmly determined to try again because she has been deeply comforted by the symbol of her homeland. This sentence clearly shows what the plant has done for Saeng’s spirit, rejuvenating and strengthening it. It also shows how that symbol acts as a soothing balm, helping to heal her sense of loss and displacement. The sentence is able to neatly wrap up the story and powerfully demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus as a connection to her past and a source of hope for the future. In the story, @CAPS1 describes the plant as a dear friend and a constant reminder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in full bloom, she’ll know that she has the inner strength and readiness to take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it comprehensively summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng, from a source of comfort to a symbol of new beginnings.
485	9348	4	3	I think the author is just trying to show that you should never give up in the face of difficulties. I think the author is also trying to show the enchanting beauty of nature. The author used this approach because in the story, Saeng failed the test, but at the end, it clearly says that she will take the test again, showing her indomitable spirit. In the story, it talks about the winter hibiscus that she carefully planted, and this is neatly concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion is basically saying that there will be a fresh new beginning, full of hope and possibilities, just like the cycle of nature.
486	9349	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because the paragraph itself already provides a fitting conclusion. It basically sums up what she intends to do all over again next time since she has already attempted it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring, she is going to have to repeat all the work, which was essentially the test. This ending gives a sense of cyclical determination to the story.
487	9350	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesn't give up. Some readers at @MONTH1 might have thought that she considered the tests back home were more important. As a result, they might have assumed that she wouldn't care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldn't be concerned about those tests. However, this conclusion shows her perseverance.
488	9351	4	3	I think that the author ends the story like that as a metaphor for people to think outside the @CAPS1 or concept. Or perhaps the author might have ended it like that so people can form a clear picture in their heads about what she was talking about. This way, the ending encourages readers to engage more deeply with the story's meaning.
489	9352	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give you an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is okay and she's going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself. In the middle of the story, when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself. So this paragraph makes her sound like she is sure of herself, like she knows exactly what she is going to do, which provides a positive shift in her character.
490	9353	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” I think that the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and produce new flowers, then Saeng should do the same. Therefore, that's why the author added that quote to the end of the story, as it symbolizes hope and renewal for Saeng.
491	9354	4	3	Saeng failed her driver's test at the very beginning of the story. Feeling disappointed, she wandered around aimlessly. Then, she chanced upon a hibiscus plant and decided to buy it as it strongly reminded her of her life in Vietnam. As she brought the flower close, she stated, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long grey hair.” Clearly, the flower was a poignant reminder of her grandmother. The mother, noticing her daughter's low spirits, gently said, “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make through the cold months.” She was trying her best to make her daughter feel better. Later on, it states, “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their fault honks clear and yes - familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” This realization marked a small yet significant step in her adaptation to the new environment.
492	9355	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange before were just part of the natural changes as the seasons were shifting and the plants were going through their life - cycles. As the seasons changed, she began to understand and accept these once - foreign elements. So the author put that paragraph at the end because in the spring, with a new sense of understanding and confidence, she goes back to school to take the test again, ready to face the challenge anew.
493	9356	4	3	The author concludes the story the way he or she does because it shows that from the moment she found the plant, there was a sign that she will get her license. So the plant serves as a constant reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms, it symbolizes a fresh start. Similarly, when she sets out to take a chance at the test, she is starting afresh, leaving behind the previous failure and looking forward to a successful outcome.
494	9357	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story, the main character fails her driving test and is deeply disheartened. But when she sees the flower, it helps remind her of the warm and comforting home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming, a symbol of perseverance. She realizes that just like the flower, it will never give up and she shouldn't either. Plus, the plant gives her the inner strength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower, which was so familiar to her, gives her and how she will not give up, ready to face the driving test once more with new determination.
495	9358	4	3	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because it combines the two imperfect situations. When she said, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She is linking the natural cycles of the environment with her personal goal. By doing so, she will prove her point that she can overcome the setback of failing the driving test. She is abbreviating the situation, turning the complex emotions and challenges into a clear - cut plan for the future, a plan to succeed.
496	9359	4	3	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter because during the spring, she would be more focused and able to just keep her mind on the test and not be distracted by the planting activities that typically occur around that time. This way, she can give her full attention to the test and increase her chances of performing well.
497	9360	4	3	I think she ended the story with that because throughout the whole story, she tries her best to work hard. She puts in consistent effort in every situation she faces. And this last sentence is saying that it's not over, that she will be back to take the test again. She tries to prove herself during the whole book, showing her determination and resilience. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants, never giving up on her goals.
498	9361	4	3	In the story, the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric. I say this because she is comparing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to overcome conditions such as the cold, and for example, in the test, the author states “its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus”. Just like the hibiscus endures the cold and has the potential to bloom again, she as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold. She will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, which is why the author concludes the story as she did.
499	9362	4	3	The concluding paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus” portrays the powerful message of change from a cold, distant failure to adapt, to a new life. Saeng relates her transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring. This is obviously shown as it states “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. She accepts this as a new chance to start fresh, and then try to pass the test. The change from winter to spring symbolizes Saeng's hardship of trying to adapt to her new home. And then, as the geese return and the hibiscus is adapting in its new environment, it is the symbol by which Saeng follows. Although it is from her old home in Vietnam, she can now also prosper elsewhere, just like the hibiscus finding a way to thrive in a new place.
500	9363	4	3	The author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again. This could have a double meaning, and mean that the author's life will bloom again, just like the flower after a period of dormancy. Overall, it was a good way to conclude the paragraph as it leaves the reader with a sense of hope and the idea that new beginnings are possible.
501	9364	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” I believe they end the story the way they did, “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because with saeng making a clear - cut goal, she’s gradually overcoming her disappointment and the discomfort of living in a new country. The archetypal meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new beginnings, and growth. This vividly shows her growing as an individual, and that kind of personal growth is extremely important in life. That’s precisely why they ended it the way they did. It’s a truly positive ending that leaves the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future.
502	9365	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that she realizes her deep - seated connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story, Saeng constantly thinks about native plants she’s seen before that are now in @LOCATION1. She closely observes how they’re well - adapted to life there, just like in the remarkable way the hibiscus can survive the harsh winter. Saeng finally realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesn’t necessarily need to adapt merely to survive, but to be truly successful in this new environment. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its natural growth cycle), she will restart her own journey and retake the test, aiming for a better outcome.
503	9366	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author’s final paragraph powerfully shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author skillfully uses symbolism when he talks about the hibiscus because it is a robust plant, just like the girl needs to be mentally and emotionally strong to pass the driving test. The author strategically put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can bravely come back after the long, cold winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to strongly emphasize the profound meaning of the hibiscus, which serves as a symbol of hope and resilience for the girl.
504	9367	4	3	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with a message of hope. After Saeng failed the test “in the main shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,” it’s truly inspiring to know that she’ll keep trying despite all her hardships. I know first - hand that homesickness can be pretty overwhelming, and finding the inner strength to keep going and make the promise “to take that test again” can be very difficult but definitely worthwhile. The author also used the ending to give another profound meaning to the hibiscus. For “when the geese return and the hibiscus is blooming,” when the winter is over and hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring, symbolizing Saeng's fresh start.
505	9368	4	3	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because it basically explained everything you needed to know for the ending. It clearly explains that she is willing to take the time to thoroughly study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass, and she wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter, and their return is a natural sign of the arrival of spring. Once they return in the spring, she will take the test over again, determined to do better. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story, leaving no loose ends for the reader.
506	9369	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show the growth or hope that Saeng has, indicating that she will gradually become comfortable in the United States. When she said ‚ÄúI-I failed the test,‚Äù I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her attachment to her home country and if she could whole - heartedly embrace this new land.
507	9370	4	3	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this significant paragraph: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" This clearly shows that you should bravely fight for what's right and what you sincerely believe in."
508	9371	4	3	Saeng wanted to clearly show that she was strong - willed and determined. She firmly wanted to make the best of things with whatever resources she had. She had unfortunately lost a great deal of hope with the big move to another country. The cold and desolate winter made her sad longing for home even more intense. She bought the flower to, in a sense, bring a piece of her homeland back to her. When the spring comes, she will rejuvenate and bud with the flower and take the test again. This new place is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no suitable time for a flower to thrive.
509	9372	4	3	Saeng did get the feeling that she was filling a void. Buying something that could offer her some comfort but also made her miss the place she was from even more. And her mother got a little mad about it because of the price she paid for it. Nevertheless, she vowed silently to herself in the spring that she would take the test again, determined to prove herself and move forward.
510	9373	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author concludes this story with that particular paragraph to clearly show that Saeng has gained the necessary confidence to take the driving test, ready to face this new challenge in her life.
511	9374	4	3	The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen next. This sense of anticipation adds an element of intrigue to the narrative. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has already told, and the future is a whole different story. It doesn't matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything there is to know about the importance of this person and her mother, thus wrapping up the core essence of the story.
512	9375	4	3	Saeng feels completely out of place in her new home and new country. The unfamiliar surroundings and different culture make her feel like an outsider. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She firmly believes that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because the girl Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home, and in a year she will be accustomed to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place, and she wants to wait a while until she tries to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself, and hopefully, she will keep the vow and make it happen, bringing a sense of hope and resolution to the story.
513	9376	4	3	The author might have concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isn't ready to stop trying; she's ready to work harder. As she sees the geese adapting to their new environment, she is inspired and chooses to try and make their new home work out. After they disappear, she picks herself up and says that she's ready to try again. By doing this, she is committing herself to try different things to adapt to changes, demonstrating her determination and resilience.
514	9377	4	3	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test at the right time when it won't be so hard on her. When the @DATE1 arrives, it will be warm again, and it's not quite as cold. The more favorable weather conditions will likely make her feel more comfortable and confident, increasing her chances of performing well on the test. This decision shows her practicality and strategic thinking, and it also gives a sense of hope for a better outcome in the story.
515	9378	4	3	The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring, it is warm and sunny, and this pleasant weather helps to end the story on a happy note. The warmth and sunlight bring a sense of optimism and renewal. Next, this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, just as the hibiscus will survive through winter. It symbolizes her ability to overcome challenges and thrive in a new environment. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph, leaving the reader with a positive impression of Saeng's character and the potential for a bright future.
516	9379	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that if the geese and hibiscus can adapt to the changing seasons and return, then she can too. As the paragraph states, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I choose this saying because it shows that if these natural elements are able to come back after everything that has happened, she can as well. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do, finding the strength and courage to face her challenges anew.
517	9380	4	3	Authors often end stories with paragraphs that make readers wonder what happens next. In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it in this way because she is looking towards the future with hope. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is blooming. She views this as a new beginning, a chance to start over. Also, the return of the geese, the blooming hibiscus, and the melted snow give her hope that she will pass her test. She believes that now that they have a hibiscus, it will be more like where she used to live, bringing a sense of familiarity and comfort. Authors use endings that make people wonder so that readers are encouraged to think deeply about the story's implications.
518	9381	4	3	The response indicates that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted those of us who read the story to understand story to understand what was going on within it. For instance, when the characters were saying that when the geese come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author was trying to give readers a sense of the characters' mindsets in the story so that we could understand what the author was talking about, allowing us to better follow the narrative and its underlying themes.
519	9382	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng. They serve as powerful reminders of her homeland. When these familiar things return, she will have the strength to take the test again and hopefully achieve a better result. The narrator says, “Overhead a skein of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.” This clearly shows how the geese are a symbol of the familiar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more at ease and comfortable in her new home, providing her with the emotional support needed to face her future challenges.
520	9383	4	3	The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and aids her in succeeding at certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says, “I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—,” and she found that she was still too shaky to say the words “at home.” She deeply misses being home, and this plant helps her bring back memories of being there. Therefore, the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland, highlighting the emotional connection she has with the hibiscus and the longing for the place she once called home.
521	9384	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, pondering why @CAPS1 it might hold significance for the author regarding Saeng. It's something personal about her past or her place of origin. She's trying to convey that when she returns in the spring, she'll take the test again at school. Or perhaps she'll plant something anew in the spring @CAPS1. As the snow @CAPS2 and it's too cold to plant anything. The place she came from is truly important to her; she misses it and yearns to go back to where she originated. This connection to her roots is what drives her future plans.
522	9385	4	3	The author concludes this story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. She does this because in the story, this plant has instilled in her a great deal of belief in herself to @MONTH1 perform better in the future. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and renewal, giving her the confidence needed to face the test once more.
523	9386	4	3	The author concludes the story in this way for a few reasons. One reason is that she will gain more experience in her new country. She only left her homeland a few months prior, so in about six more months, she'll be more knowledgeable about the ways of the new country. This increased familiarity will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Also, in the spring, the flower will be in full bloom again, and its beauty will give her a new - found strength that will enable her to pass. The few months' time will allow the author to prepare mentally and physically for the exam. Mentally, she'll be able to study thoroughly and learn all she needs to know. And physically, with the passage of time and a bit of aging, she'll gain new insights and maturity, all of which will contribute to her success in the test.
524	9387	4	3	In order to overcome her failure, Saeng bought a flower that vividly reminded her of home. Saeng started to cry when she bought the flower, as the memories it triggered made her long to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate how she'll take the test when she feels at home. “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Saeng said to herself. These natural phenomena and the blooming of the hibiscus make her feel welcome, and this sense of comfort will aid her in the test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the elements she's comfortable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what evokes memories of her home. It also explains how much the hibiscus flower meant to her. Buying the flower helps her cope with her troubles. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her idyllic home. The author concludes the story with these memories that will surely support Saeng in the future, acting as a source of strength and motivation.
525	9388	4	3	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because everyone should have fresh starts or second chances. I guess the author was leaving a message stating that if you fail once, you should at least give it another try. When Saeng failed the test, it seemed as though her self - esteem took a nosedive, and her mother tried her best to cheer her up. Eventually, Saeng realized that giving up and not attempting again with a fresh start would be a mistake. This realization not only shows her growth but also reinforces the author's message about the importance of perseverance and second chances.
526	9389	4	3	"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that Saeng felt better and more confident when vividly reminded of home. When Saeng saw the hibiscus, she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral."" The flower was creatively used by Ho. She elaborated that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold, harsh months. This description made the reader think, after carefully reading the last paragraph, that this resilient flower must give Saeng hope and a boost of confidence. Also, the geese form a V in the sky, which I inferred would symbolize Vietnam to Saeng, which is exactly what the author is trying to get her readers to contemplate. That is precisely why ""and the geese return"" is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to deeply realize that objects that make us feel more comfortable and bring us happiness are what ultimately make us strong and confident. The author did an outstanding job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the valuable lesson, and that is that you should engage in things when you feel confident and it feels like a true home to you. You may be small and fragile, but if you ""plant"" yourself firmly, you can thrive with unwavering confidence. This realization serves as a powerful reminder of the strength that can be found in the simplest of things."
527	9390	4	3	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the author's subtle way of showing how Saeng desperately wanted spring to arrive early because she yearned to see her beloved hibiscus. If spring doesn't come quickly, she will not get the chance to see the vibrant hibiscus in full bloom, and the thick layer of snow won't melt away. When Saeng musters the courage to face her challenges, she hopes she can take the test with a newfound sense of determination. This longing for spring and the sight of the hibiscus represents her hope for a fresh start and the confidence to overcome her obstacles.
528	9391	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a brand - new beginning for her. For example, back in her home town, she had beautiful hibiscuses all around, and everything was peaceful and normal. She lived her life with a sense of comfort and familiarity. Then, she moved to the U.S., and suddenly she didn't have any hibiscus around her. She just failed her driving test, felt out of place, and like she didn't fit in. So, when she caught sight of that winter hibiscus, she felt as if she had found a precious piece of her past that could help her feel at home or at ease, almost like a warm embrace. She felt a strong sense of security wash over her. In conclusion, the author ended with that sentence because it marks a new chapter for her, and that hibiscus means a fresh start, a chance to leave behind her failures and move forward with hope."
529	9392	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it closely resembles her own life, suggesting that she will have another chance, just as the geese will come back again without fail. The reason why the last part reflects back to her life is that it mentions spring. Spring is usually a wonderful time of the year because as it progresses towards the end of the season, it gets warmer, and the world comes alive again. Flowers start to bloom, and the hibiscus plant will once again burst into beautiful blossoms. This renewal, in a way, rekindles her warm memories of her old home. Then, that will be the perfect time for her to retake her driving test that she unfortunately failed before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it ties in and matches so seamlessly with the story, creating a sense of hope and closure.
530	9393	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with one small paragraph is because sometimes the little things truly count the most. The author thought that in just two well - crafted sentences, he could effectively summarize the most important elements in the story. I think the author did a great job in this regard. By using a concise paragraph, the author was able to distill the essence of the story, leaving a lasting impression on the reader. This shows that even a short passage can convey profound meaning and make a significant impact.
531	9394	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because Saeng has to retake the test completely. She believes that @MONTH1 there's a better chance when the hibiscus blooms and the snow melts. This is when nature comes alive again, symbolizing new beginnings. So, that is precisely when Saeng is going to attempt and take the test after the snow has melted and the hibiscus has fully bloomed, hoping for a more favorable outcome.
532	9395	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple of reasons. Saeng feels that she can't take on the challenge until the spring arrives because that's when the geese return from their long - distance migration. Also, that is the time when the hibiscus starts to form delicate buds. In a way, she senses that just like the natural world awakening in spring, she will blossom and gain the necessary skills and confidence to pass the test. This connection to nature gives her the hope and determination to succeed.
533	9396	4	3	I think that the author includes this paragraph in this story because the grandmother might think that it is a test to see what she can get done @CAPS1 time. Perhaps she views it as an opportunity to prove her efficiency and capabilities. The grandmother might end up getting more done than she should @CAPS2, driven by a sense of determination and a desire to pass this perceived test. This shows her strong - willed nature and her eagerness to meet the expectations, real or imagined.
534	9397	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she's saying that by that time she'll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when the signs of spring appear, such as the blooming of flowers and the return of warmer weather, she would be well - prepared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the start of a new spring, which brings renewal and fresh starts, it would be a new beginning for her, filled with hope and the possibility of success.
535	9398	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test, she finds the courage to take it over after having the meaningful experience of planting with her mother. Planting the hibiscus has been a therapeutic and confidence - building activity for her. In the story, it becomes evident that she was gradually getting used to the process of planting, learning patience and perseverance. Now that she has accomplished the task of planting and seen the progress, she knows that she can take the test again and achieve success. In conclusion, that is why I firmly believe the author concluded with that paragraph, highlighting Saeng's growth and new - found determination.
536	9399	4	3	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think deeply because she wants to strongly emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, who has recently moved to a new place, the hibiscus is in a brand - new environment and has to quickly adapt to the unfamiliar surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test, so she's quite bummed about that setback. The concluding sentence makes you clearly realize that if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings, Saeng can surely overcome her driving challenges. This connection between Saeng and the hibiscus enriches the story's meaning and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
537	9400	4	3	The author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother a glimmer of hope. It could offer hope because they are in a situation where they really need Saeng to pass the test. Passing the test would bring more convenience to the family, perhaps allowing Saeng to help with errands or even contribute to the family's income. This hope is crucial as it gives them something positive to look forward to in the midst of their current circumstances.
538	9401	4	3	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It effectively re - established the meaning of the hibiscus and clearly explained why it was so important to Saeng. It showed the strong determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph, we would have been left merely assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories, such an open - ended approach might have worked, but in this case, it was absolutely needed. When she first saw the hibiscus, she broke down because she could not vividly remember her homeland. This is precisely why the hibiscus is so significant to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end, it helped the reader smoothly follow what was to come next, even though the story had come to an end. It was essential to express this again. In the last paragraph, it says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a brand - new beginning for Saeng and a fresh chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important, and without it, these events would be left hanging, leaving the story's meaning unclear. With it, as a reader, the meaning of the story becomes much more distinct.
539	9402	4	3	Including the bit about taking the test again when the “hibiscus is budding” provides a strong sense of closure and a valuable lesson to an otherwise open - ended story. Saeng fails the driver's test early in the story, and then on her way home, she impulsively buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn't see a clear connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perseverance and strength. After a long and harsh winter, this hibiscus can bravely bloom again and continue to thrive. Even after moving from Vietnam and struggling to adapt to a new life, Saeng must find the inner strength to recover and keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again after adversity, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time with newfound determination and is likely to pass. She will gradually adapt to her environment and keep moving forward, just like the resilient hibiscus. This parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus gives the story a powerful and inspiring message.
540	9403	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph ‘When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,’ because the author started out the story right after Saeng failed her driving test. Saeng is deeply reminded from the Hibiscus about her homeland, which brings back a flood of memories and emotions. After Saeng wanted the Hibiscus in the garden, “a flock of Canada geese flew by”. As they flew by, Saeng felt a strong sense of comfort and a sign of hope. She then vowed to herself what started everything. If Saeng did pass the driving test then she would have never found the Hibiscus, and thus would have missed out on the inspiration and connection to her homeland that the plant brought. This sequence of events shows how even a setback like failing the test can lead to something meaningful and life - changing.
541	9404	4	3	The author includes it because her mother took the test and successfully passed it, and the daughter was deeply inspired. She earnestly wanted to achieve the same feat, just like her admirable mom. Moreover, she can only take the test in the spring since there are no flowers blooming in the winter, which is a key condition for the test. This way, she can experience the test under the most suitable circumstances, following in her mother's footsteps.
542	9405	4	3	I think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and gradually get over the numerous struggles in her life. It is clearly showing that she has finally gotten well - used to @LOCATION1 and its unique customs. However, she still hasn't forgotten her precious heritage. The quote “But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.” vividly proves this. It also indicates that she is going to stay positive and not let difficulties overshadow her. She's determined to retake the test and try again. At the beginning, she had a rather bleak look at her life situations. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cheerful, optimistic outlook on her situation and firmly decides to take action about it.
543	9406	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she's concluding that the winter is firmly here. When winter is over, she is going to start the activities of flowering and planting again. In the story, it clearly said, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,...”. So, now she has to patiently wait for winter to pass by. Then the hibiscus will start to grow, and hopefully, by spring, it will be in full bloom, alone yet beautiful. This symbolizes new beginnings and hope, which is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.
544	9407	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of “what about her test?” needed to be subtly answered, and that's when she'd become comfortable enough to take it. In the text, to her, the plant felt incredibly smooth and cool just as she had always known it, which was extremely comforting. She gently closed her palm around it and held it tightly. That, at least, she could firmly hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, filled with sadness and maybe a bit of disappointment, which she probably wouldn't want to deal with for a while. It was even hinted at in the conclusion that her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the planned time because she'll have both new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and the plant, which will give her a sense of stability and hope.
545	9408	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be well - prepared and fully ready for the garden and the various challenges it holds. This first time, she was completely inexperienced and not ready at all. She didn't know about the winter hibiscus because she had never engaged in anything like gardening it before. But with this experience, she will surely learn and be better equipped for future endeavors in the garden.
546	9409	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the story ends with saying “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason the author ends the story like that is because it shows that even though she failed the test once in @MONTH1, she’s not going to give up just because of an adjustment change. The hibiscus makes the reader realize that just as the plantation where she lives can adapt, so can she. This ending gives a sense of hope and resilience, showing that setbacks are only temporary.
547	9410	4	3	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming in the spring, she will feel more at home and will be in a healthy state of mind. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma with her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming, then it would vividly remind her of her grandma, which would serve as an incentive to do well on the test. This connection between the blooming flower and her grandma gives the story an emotional depth and a motivation for her future attempt.
548	9411	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time, marking the passage from winter to spring. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is, perhaps to draw a parallel with the character's own feelings of isolation. This use of nature and personification adds a layer of symbolism to the story's conclusion.
549	9412	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because it’s telling how Saeng feels about winter being near and how she has to wait until spring comes back around to do her test again. Saeng might feel a sense of impatience and longing during the winter, but she knows that spring will bring a new opportunity. This waiting period adds tension and anticipation to the story, making the reader root for her success in the upcoming test.
550	9413	4	3	Saeng cares deeply about the flowers. She has a special fondness for them, especially the unique ones. She appreciates the natural occurrence of them growing in their own distinct ways. This care for the flowers shows her connection to nature and her ability to find beauty in the simple things. It also reflects her gentle and observant personality.
551	9414	4	3	In the story, I don't know why the author included that particular part, and to be honest, I really can't figure it out. Maybe she was talking about how she had taken all the tests, and now she wouldn't take them over again. The time had come. She was in school, and when one took the test, it was about that kind of achievement. Now, it's @DATE1, and school is over, marking the end of this testing phase.
552	9415	4	3	The reason why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is that at the end of the story, they needed a proper ending. Another reason is that they picked a conclusion that would best fit the overall flow and theme of this story, thus providing a satisfactory wrap - up for the narrative.
553	9416	4	3	I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the central theme of the story was perseverance. For example, the story was based around the winter hibiscus plant. This is a great example because in the end, Saeng vows that she will persevere and take her test again. Similarly, the hibiscus perseveres and endures through the winter, not allowing itself to wither away. Another instance is that @CAPS1's mother worked outside in the cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story as she stayed out in the cold garden to complete her job; she could have easily quit and gone inside the warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she wouldn't try to take her test again. But she didn't; she firmly stated that she was going to try once more, reinforcing the theme of perseverance.
554	9417	4	3	I think the author ended this story like that because it indicates that she hasn't given up yet. Even though she failed the first time, she is determined to try again. The line “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” implies that when all is right and favorable, she will attempt it again because if she passes, it will be a significant achievement. However, the story was rather lackluster for me because I don't even know what she failed, which is why I didn't enjoy it.
555	9418	4	3	I think the reason why the author ended the story with this “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” paragraph is that, just like the plant didn't have a good chance for survival in the harsh winter, the girl faced a difficult situation when she took her driving test. But in spring, the plant has the opportunity to bloom, and similarly, she has a chance to pass the test. This shows that there is a time and place for everything, and with the right conditions, success can be achieved.
556	9419	4	3	Emotion, commitment, hope – all are compelling reasons why the author ended the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” As @CAPS1 can observe, that last paragraph clearly shows that she is filled with deep - seated emotion. Next, it vividly demonstrates her commitment. By stating that when the hibiscus comes back she will take the test again, she is firmly setting her resolve. Lastly, it radiates hope, indicating that she will strive to redeem herself. These are all the well - founded reasons why the author chose to use that impactful last paragraph to conclude the story.
557	9420	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to strongly emphasize her new - found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, “she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.” At this crucial point, she has a profound epiphany and realizes that life is very much like the changing seasons. In the end paragraph, she further illustrates this thought by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus endures a long, harsh winter and then blooms vibrantly in the spring, she must stay strong during these difficult times. One day, her time will surely come for her to “bloom.” @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must remain strong and steadfast as we patiently wait for our time to “bloom,” just as the hibiscus does in its season.
558	9421	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because he wanted to clearly show that she wasn't going to give up just because she failed one time. She had failed the test already and was extremely sad about it. In her distress, she went and bought a plant. Saeng's mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. When Saeng tearfully told her mom about the test failure, her mom was very understanding. Her mom could have been very angry with her, but instead, she offered support. They could have used a plant that they grew themselves, but the plant @MONTH1 might not grow right now. Perhaps she should have bought a real, healthy plant from someone else to symbolize a fresh start. All in all, the author used this ending to highlight her resilience in the face of failure.
559	9422	4	3	Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each is a valid reason why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. After buying the plant, she finds a new glimmer of hope and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she watches the geese flying gracefully overhead, she is deeply struck by the determination they must possess and vows whole - heartedly to do better on the test next year. With the new flower in her hands, she feels as if she's starting afresh so that she's able to pass this test that seems so important to her. When the author writes, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it powerfully shows symbolism. By describing the flower blooming new buds, it symbolically represents that Saeng wants to turn over a new leaf and start anew. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each of these elements is a key reason why I think the author skillfully concluded the story with this meaningful paragraph.
560	9423	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho ends the story with the statement, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because it effectively shows that Saeng had successfully overcome her problem and firmly vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement, the author clearly demonstrates that the beauty of nature can greatly help one to overcome their problems, just as it did for Saeng. Upon seeing the geese's migratory journey and the “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng “realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng understood that the test, although strange and different to her initially, became more familiar because of her experiences with nature, specifically seeing the geese and the “Winter Hibiscus.” This plant also evoked memories of her past in Vietnam and all the good times at her home. “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly mashed.” The experience made her think of those wonderful memories. The plant filled her with so much joy that she stopped dwelling on the past and started focusing on the future, on taking the test again and building her new life in the United States. This ending effectively ties together the themes of hope, resilience, and the power of nature in Saeng's journey.
561	9424	4	3	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story at the end is to show us the raids and the sense of longing that, even though the current situation is almost over, she doesn't want it to end. However, she knows that it will also start up again. Next year, when things go back to the way they were before everything changed, the cycle will repeat. This is why I think the author put that line into the story as it encapsulates this complex mix of emotions and the inevitability of change.
562	9425	4	3	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again” to express her firm determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was gradually getting used to. Describing spring was crucial in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but over time, she got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author’s conclusion was “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it clearly expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life, seeing it as an opportunity for a new start.
563	9426	4	3	In “winter Hibiscus” the author uses the hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country. At the end of the story, I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus, she vividly remembers her old life, which she deeply loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think everyone should always remember that even though one may be disappointed at some time, we have to keep in mind the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good, like the hibiscus, and use it as a source of strength.
564	9427	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar in a profound way. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring just like the plant that thrives and blossoms, will she be truly ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring, full of new life and potential. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph, as it effectively draws a parallel between Saeng's personal growth and the natural cycle of the plant.
565	9428	4	3	"I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph because it skillfully refers to previous events in the story. For example, it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it strongly reminded her of home. This is a really good way to conclude a story as it creates a sense of continuity and connection. I wouldn't change it at all if I could. Also, in the summary before the story, it says how she had failed her driver’s test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again”. I think Saeng didn't have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but now that she is familiar with everything and has found a hobby, she will have a positive mindset of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing, using the new - found familiarity and the symbol of the hibiscus as motivation."
566	9429	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has overcome the set - back and she desires to retake the quiz solely for her own self - affirmation. She wants to prove to herself, and no one else, that she can do it. She states, “When they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Clearly, she expresses her intention to retake the test. This shows that she is not succumbing to external pressure. Instead, she is taking this step to prove her capabilities to herself and no one else.
567	9430	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng fondly recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1. She deeply misses her homeland and all the cherished aspects of her previous life before arriving here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph where Saeng vows to take her driver's test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a specific reason. The author wants to illustrate that Saeng is as strong as the winter hibiscus, capable of surviving the harsh winter. She will be fully prepared when the tiring days of winter pass and the beautiful days of spring arrive. Saeng's mother states, “...it's strong enough to make it through the cold months... That's what matters.” Just like the winter hibiscus, Saeng is resilient and strong enough to endure the difficult winter months.
568	9431	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to arouse the reader's curiosity and make them yearn for more. When an author ends a chapter of a story or an episode of a show, using a cliff - hanger is often a smart strategy to keep the audience engaged. In many stories I have read, this technique is frequently employed. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book, it consistently ends with a cliff - hanger. For instance, at the end of the third book, one of the soldiers is killed, but the identity of the killer remains unknown until the next book. This keeps the readers eager to continue the story and find out what happens next.
569	9432	4	3	The author concludes this story in this way to convey that the girl is not going to give up on her attempt to fit into this new country. By ending the story like this, it implies that the journey is not over. Even though she failed the test this time, the author suggests that the next time will be different. The author makes it clear that the little girl cares deeply about the test and is determined to prove to others that she can pass it. The flowers remind her of her home, and with this connection, she believes she can retake the test and do it right. This shows her unwavering spirit and determination to succeed in the new environment.
570	9434	4	3	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng disliked the cold weather. So, she decided to wait until the snow melts and the geese return to test the plants again. This indicates her preference for more favorable conditions. I also think she added it to show that Saeng would come back to visit her mother. Perhaps the arrival of spring, with its warmer weather and the return of the geese, would be the perfect time for her to make this visit, as it aligns with her comfort and the change in the season.
571	9435	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the driving test, which was a setback for her. In the spring, when the weather becomes more pleasant and she has had more time to practice, she will take the test over, hoping for a better outcome.
572	9436	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides a proper closure to both Saeng and the story's arc. Saeng was deeply upset about the fact that she failed her driving test. However, towards the end of the story, she has a realization. She understands that things happen in life, and sometimes we have absolutely no control over what occurs. But when something knocks you down, you've also got to pick yourself up again. When seeing the geese flying in the sky and the beautiful hibiscus in bloom, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam. So, she will have to adapt to the way we drive here, along with all our rules and laws. This is precisely why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.
573	9437	4	3	Saeng was taking a crucial driving test, and unfortunately, she didn't quite pass it. She was extremely afraid to tell her mother the bad news because she knew her mother had high hopes for her. But she knew that she had to tell her anyway. When she finally broke the news, her mother got upset because Saeng didn't pass the test. Saeng is well - aware that right after winter's over, when the days start getting warmer and the world comes back to life, she'll be taking that same test again. She sincerely hopes she will pass it this time and finally get her driver's license.
574	9438	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” because she wanted to make the story end with Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive outlooks in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a rather sad disposition about her new home. The plants around her remind her of her recent home. “I mean it's not the kind we had - at - at -” she found that she was still too shaky to say the words “at home”, and at last, she burst into tears again. This phrase clearly shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly heartbroken about it. The concluding phrase shown before indicates that she found the inner strength to look positively at the future of her new home.
575	9439	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story, Saeng went to take a driving test but didn't pass. Feeling disappointed and out of place, she goes and buys a hibiscus. This hibiscus reminds her of home and gives her the strength and comfort she desperately needs. Her mother, being very perceptive, knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country. She doesn't want to put more pressure on her just because she can see that Saeng is very upset. So, to cheer her up and encourage her, her mother decides to buy a flower for her. She says that by next spring, when nature is in full bloom again, Saeng should be well - adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know that she is there for her every step of the way.
576	9440	4	3	I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it clearly shows that she isn't giving up on her goal of passing the test. The second reason is it gives a strong feeling of hope about what the future might hold. The last reason is it leaves us deeply wondering if she will make it next time. That is probably why the author ended the story in such a way, as it adds an element of suspense and optimism.
577	9441	4	3	The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the clear connection between the hibiscus and Saeng. The hibiscus has to endure the harsh winter until spring arrives, when it can finally bloom and become big and beautiful. Saeng is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through the various obstacles that come with the change in environment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the tough weather. She feels that right now she's just like the Hibiscus. She's trapped because the area is completely alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it's used to being free in its natural habitat. But once it's planted in the right place, it will become a part of its surroundings and grow. And once she whole - heartedly accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence, as it effectively ties together the themes of resilience and adaptation.
578	9442	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at first attempt, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first during the test, but will blossom at spring. It also serves as a symbol of her constant blossoming throughout the story. The author’s intention of the last line was demonstrated early when Saeng was deeply disappointed of failing the test. She is extremely upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get a strong morale boost and starts to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a very negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets extremely nervous and scared, so scared that she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then gently wipes the green matter off and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a significant morale boost and starts to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead her mother accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and gives herself the determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again, just like the hibiscus.
579	9443	4	3	The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more detailed information into the paragraph. The author is trying to talk about the life that Saeng had vowed silently to herself. In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. It implies that when flowers start blooming again and spring comes around again, that's when she will take that test and pass this time, as if the renewal of nature will bring her good luck and success.
580	9444	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this because she's proving she has the inner strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as both a precious memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a strong reminder of home and her important promise. Saeng said, “It's not a real one” “Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng deeply loved home and wished she was back there, but her new promise of retaking the test and passing it was what truly mattered in the end, showing her growth and determination.
581	9445	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because it marks the start of a whole new daytime. That saying means that she will take the test on a budding new day. For example, the geese return when it's spring, and the hibiscus buds, and she has the test in the spring. This new - found freshness and renewal of spring is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
582	9446	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test during the spring time. Spring time is a well - known symbol of positive feelings. She gets these positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus, which represents new beginnings and hope, making it an ideal time for her to face the driving test.
583	9447	4	3	They had to come back, so they did. As they were walking, they stepped into an otherworld over there in the corner, a childhood world just as she had known it would feel, a world filled with the familiar scents and long - forgotten memories that wrapped around them like a warm blanket.
584	9448	4	3	This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back to their familiar grounds seasonally, Saeng will come back to take the test. Similarly, the Hibiscus plant, which has its own cycle of blooming, will also bloom again. She firmly believes that it is the right thing to do and that there will be an appropriate time to come back and take the test. This paragraph describes Saeng well, showing how she lives her life with patience and how she will take the test again when she feels it is the opportune moment.
585	9449	4	3	"I believe that the author ends the story this way because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes."" (Ho) This quote clearly shows that passing the test meant a great deal to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and then failed the test. Her failure was a heavy blow, and she showed her sadness by crying. ""Then I will take the test again."" (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is resolutely determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly, so she can't wait to try again and pass because she is determined to achieve success. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success, and her unwavering determination serves as an inspiration."
586	9450	4	3	The author uses this well - crafted paragraph to conclude the story, effectively showing Saeng's determination and her successful adaption to her new home. This clearly demonstrates her determination as it explicitly states “I will take that test again.” This also indicates that she has fully adapted to her new home, having found the resolve to face challenges head - on.
587	9451	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was deeply upset about having to move to a new place. She is also quite disappointed that she failed her driver's test. So, she planted the plant as a sort of symbol of hope. And she says that when spring arrives, with its new beginnings, she will retry her driver's test, showing her determination to overcome this setback.
588	9452	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph where Saeng vows she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it conveys a powerful message of never giving up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her driver's test. But after buying the Hibiscus and delving deeper into the experience, she realized that she shouldn't give up easily and should face challenges with perseverance.
589	9453	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence for strong emphasis. It effectively takes Saeng’s mind off of the flower and allows her to focus intently on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test, it gives her a definite goal and something positive to look forward to. This statement also clearly shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note by explaining this. The last paragraph is also a distinct break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng was just doing. It represents Saeng’s last and final thoughts, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
590	9454	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. I think it is to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back, symbolizing new life and renewal, she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is blooming, then I will take that test again.” This connection between the natural cycle of the hibiscus and her attempt at the test gives a sense of hope and a new beginning.
591	9455	4	3	The author concludes the story with a well - crafted paragraph so that the people reading the story would actually engage with the narrative and read it attentively, instead of simply guessing how the story is going to unfold.
592	9456	4	3	The author's conclusion in the story clearly explains that after all that dedicated teamwork and hard work, you should maintain that positive flow each year. Even though certain circumstances might have changed, the spirit of collaboration and effort should persevere.
593	9457	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a profound feeling of hope. Saeng had a truly bad time, starting from failing the test to experiencing a deep - seated feeling of loss. After finding the hibiscus and carefully planting it, she seemed to be enlightened. Although she missed her homeland, the memories provided her with a sense of comfort. She shows remarkable determination as she firmly declares she will take that test again and seems to have gained more confidence in herself. The author adds that Saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is a time of new beginnings and life. When the hibiscus is budding, symbolizing rebirth, she will take the test. It will indeed be a new, much better start for Saeng too.
594	9458	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's strong determination. It clearly shows that Saeng wants to take her time to gradually adjust to her new life and her new surroundings. Then she believes that maybe, after getting used to this new place for a while, it will start to feel more like home. She feels that if she has become accustomed to this new environment, she will have a better chance at passing the test. She is resolutely determined to pass the test.
595	9459	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a firm promise to not give up on getting her license. The hibiscus makes her feel as if she is at home again. In the text, when the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" When she says this, it eases Saeng's sadness as she knows that the hibiscus will constantly remind her of the hibiscus at home. This connection gives her the inner strength to want to try again in the spring."
596	9460	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistent Saeng is. Saeng is persistent because she tries over and over again at this “test,” and also she tries to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump, and for her to be confident with herself is very persistent. The way the author concludes the story, with this powerful vow, definitely portrays Saeng, the main character, as a persistent person, and that is the clear purpose of the quote.
597	9461	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants the audience to think about what he said and to want to read more. For example, I was reading a book that ended with a question, and I was really curious to know what the answer to the question was, so I wanted to read more. Another example is that I was reading another book, and it ended with a statement. I was so engaged that I wanted to read another book in the series, but unfortunately, they didn't have one available. So, I never got to know how the story ended. That's why authors end stories like that; they use such endings to make you eager to read another book or continue exploring the story.
598	9462	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope, to show the growth of her character, and to show how things are going to change. In the last paragraph, when she vows that she will take that test again, it gives you a strong sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story, she had been crying and missing her homeland, and the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test, she is still determined to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grown. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger and more determined she is. Lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come. The geese coming back, the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her, and it clearly foreshadows that things will be different from now on.
599	9463	4	3	The author concluded the story with that message because if you think about it carefully, not having a definite ending seems to open up the whole story and leaves a clear opening for a sequel. It's obvious that the whole point of the story is to make you think deeply about the events and the characters. By ending the story in this way, the author encourages the readers to use their imagination and come up with their own ideas about what might happen next, which also adds an element of mystery and intrigue to the overall story.
600	9464	4	3	I think the author adds this paragraph because it is a clear sign of a new start for her. Just because she has had a hard time doesn't mean that she will always have hard times. This paragraph shows that there is a possibility for change and improvement in her life. It gives a glimmer of hope that she can move forward from her current difficulties and embrace a better future. So, this paragraph serves as an important turning - point in the story, highlighting the potential for a fresh beginning.
601	9465	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it held great significance for Saeng. Saeng had failed her driving test and was scared to tell her mother that she had also spent nineteen dollars on “Dok Faeng - noi”, a flower/plant they had back at home. For instance, “As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant.” The plant Saeng saw was of deep meaning to her mother. “@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. ‘Dok faeng - noi,’ she said. ‘Where did you get it.’” This quote clearly shows that her mother was excited upon hearing about it. The story is concluded by that paragraph because after all the difficulties Saeng went through, her mother was glad she bought it. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng - noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” In this way, the conclusion ties up the emotional threads of the story.
602	9466	4	3	Authors sometimes use interesting sentences as their concluding sentences that you @MONTH1 might have a hard time understanding. In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author concludes her story by saying “when they come back. Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author says this to clearly show that Saeng is not ready to graduate yet and needs to learn more. The mother is very disappointed in the daughter for buying a plant that is very expensive, which shows her inexperience as buying things because of your feelings is wrong. This is evident when they say “I paid over Nineteen dollars for it.” “You what?” She also says “@CAPS1 facing. Na where did you gott that”, showing her surprise at the expensive and beautiful plant. Authors use those paragraphs and sentences to show or recap the story. The author of “winter hibiscus” concludes her story with the paragraph because Saeng should not have bought the plant based solely on her emotions and that she shall try again next year to not make the same mistakes.
603	9467	4	3	The author of the passage ends the story with this statement to create curiosity. This creates curiosity through writing about waiting for the spring and the geese to return. Spring is the beginning for many creatures on the earth. Therefore, Saeng is trying to start over because she must wait for the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginning as each year new buds grow, just like she can have a second chance. Saeng waits for the spring because she knows that is when everything else creates new life, so she must wait till then to get her new beginning. By ending the story this way, the author leaves the reader intrigued about Saeng's future success.
604	9468	4	3	I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driver’s test. Before she made that decision, she was disheartened because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the spring time because that gives her sufficient time to get herself together and practice between then and the spring time. This way, she can regain her confidence and improve her driving skills. The spring represents a fresh start, and she hopes to use this period to prepare thoroughly for the retest.
605	9469	4	3	The author includes this sentence, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to clearly show her determination. She is firmly determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1, she wants to succeed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared. This shows Saeng's strong - willed nature and her belief in her ability to overcome challenges with proper preparation.
606	9470	4	3	From the story of the girl who just moved from Vietnam to the United States. It will be extremely hard for the young girl to understand most things in this new environment, and any small thing can bring her vivid memories back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl, Saeng, did fail the test and she wants to see the hibiscus is budding. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng said it nervously to her mother. Her mother actually understands well why it happened and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will surely make Saeng feel better. Saeng misses Vietnam a great deal and will like to try her very best to overcome the various obstacles in this new land.
607	9471	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph because he wants to make the content more clearly presented so that the readers would understand it more easily. And so he could refine the writing to make it better stand out among other similar works. By doing so, the key points of the text can be grasped more readily by the audience.
608	9472	4	3	The author finished off the story with that paragraph because the paragraph is saying that over time, when she has adapted well to everything in this new place, she will be able to take the test with more confidence. So that’s why she says “...and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” “It that all it needs is time. Time to get warm and time to grow.” Also, the paragraph is well - thought - out and closely relates to the entire story. So she concluded with a great paragraph that made a lot of sense in relationship with the story, leaving a deep impression on the readers.
609	9473	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact that the flower represents her happiness from her home country. The flower symbolizes the past and a sense of comfort. Once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus"" in, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now."" All of Saeng’s senses were beginning to return; she was truly happy. Likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her gradually began to feel like home. She became more and more familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home were made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. Therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explains the reason why Ho concluded with that sentence, effectively tying up the themes of the story."
610	9474	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” means to the author kinda like the profound meaning to life. That if you mess up, it’s okay. You just need to try again and strive to do better. This message gives hope and inspiration, not only to the character in the story but also to the readers.
611	9475	4	3	She concludes that paragraph with the story because she really wants the people to realize that she is and is always having a great deal of fun. Also, that she loves where she is at. She's making her way in the world and she loves watching flowers, like when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. That shows that her favorite thing to do, the thing she loves most, is observing flowers. This connection to nature and the simple joys it brings truly reflects her positive outlook on life.
612	9476	4	3	The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. “I will take that test again,” This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed specifically tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so incredibly important to her. The part in the quote, “when they come back.... when they show me it and the geese return,” is referring to when she says, “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become … almost familiar to her. Like the geese.” She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to, much like the geese that fly south every winter. When she uses “and this hibiscus is budding,” she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center – just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return, meaning in the @DATE1, then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass, thus re - establishing her connection to her roots.
613	9477	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginnings, which is a symbol of Saeng's vow. Also, in the story, caring for the plant teaches Saeng responsibility in obtaining her license. By caring for the plant, it will teach her patience and that she needs to learn from the mistakes she has made. This connection between plant - care and personal growth emphasizes the life lessons Saeng can gain on her journey towards independence.
614	9478	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng had failed her driver's test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. “She was still too shaky to feel at home” she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes. So the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still has hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.” This determination shows that despite the setbacks, Saeng is committed to making a new start in her new life.
615	9479	4	3	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again and pass. This teaches a valuable lesson to the reader. Lessons such as trying your hardest and don't give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sense of curiosity. It makes you want to know more, like if she passes. This lingering curiosity leaves the reader with a lasting impression and a reminder of the power of perseverance.
616	9480	4	3	I think that the concluding paragraph means that after all the other important events and everything that is supposed to happen have taken place, then she will take the test. This is because it is basically the last thing that has to occur. I believe she will pass it because it is meant to be, as if it is part of the natural sequence of events.
617	9481	4	3	I believe that Saeng made that silent vow to herself because after the plant endures the harsh winter and once everything returns to the way she prefers it, and the plant begins to bud again, that kind of symbolizes her difficult time with moving. So, if this plant that she loves so dearly can survive through it, then she can overcome her challenges too, showing her inner strength and determination.
618	9482	4	3	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because it not only emphasizes Saeng's pain of coming to an unknown place and failing her first test but also highlights Saeng's resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself holds great significance for Saeng. For example, the text reads “And besides it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” This excerpt clearly demonstrates Saeng's deep love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another instance is when Saeng told her mother the bad news “I - I failed the test.” Her mother's attention was instantly drawn to the flower, and her mother could only offer kind words. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng's source of strength as it is the only familiar thing she has in the United States. Saeng wants to show the same determination on her test that the flower shows in the harsh winter, proving her ability to persevere."
619	9483	4	3	The author concludes the story with the aforementioned paragraph to represent the strong connection between the return of the hibiscus's buds and the return of Saeng's resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower appears out of place, as if it doesn't belong, much like Saeng in this new environment. The hibiscus serves as a link to Saeng's past, as portrayed when the author writes: “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to recall her past, she started to come to terms with the present and later look forward to the future. “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,” showing that she is ready to face her challenges with newfound courage.
620	9484	4	3	By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be fully prepared for her test. When the geese return, they are ready to resume their normal life after their long - distance migration. And when the hibiscus is budding, it is on the verge of transforming into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, just as the flower and the geese are ready for their respective phases, she too will be ready to take on the test and achieve success.
621	9485	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrator, now open - minded, is willing to accept and adapt to her new environment, just as the flower would do. Geese have a natural preference for warmth over cold, so they are flying south for the winter. Saeng’s “comfort zone” is in @LOCATION1, where she has numerous childhood memories, including those of her beloved grandmother and the beautiful hibiscus flower. She is accustomed to the flower thriving in a warm environment. So, when the geese return in the gentle spring and the flower blossoms once again, she will be fully ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her drivers test with confidence. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a poignant symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1, which she misses deeply. After these natural signs, she will strive to adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life and embrace her new beginning.
622	9486	4	3	Saeng would return to her homeland, yearning to be back in the familiar places filled with cherished memories. She longed to revisit the streets where she played as a child, the fields where she spent lazy afternoons, and the houses of her dear relatives. Returning to her homeland would be like coming home after a long and tiring journey, a chance to reconnect with her roots and find peace within herself.
623	9487	4	3	In the passage “winter hibiscus,” the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph: “when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” I believe she concluded this story with these words because she has changed. She is suggesting that just as the birds fly away but always return with the changing seasons, life has its cycles. An example of this is when she describes the birds easing into the hibiscus, mingling with it. In the last paragraph, it seems she is thinking that she will stay again next season and focus on what she truly likes to do. This is what I understand from the last paragraph of the story “winter hibiscus” and what it means to me. It shows the hope and resilience within Saeng.
624	9488	4	3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph to show that when spring arrives and the geese are present, Saeng silently tells herself that she is going to take the permit test again. The author uses this moment to emphasize Saeng's determination. Spring, with the return of the geese, symbolizes new beginnings and hope. By setting this goal for herself, Saeng is showing her will to move forward and make a fresh start in her life, proving that she is ready to face the challenges ahead.
625	9489	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to vividly show Saeng’s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she is not entirely happy with her purchase, she is making sincere efforts to make it seem more like a cozy home. When she says “will take that test again,” she clearly shows how she desires her surroundings to be comfortable and inviting. By ending with this paragraph, it also showcases a strong connection with the changing seasons. As if with the arrival of spring, Saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is carefully planning to please herself and her mother again in the rejuvenating spring. This paragraph also serves as a heartfelt promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The plant is like a powerful symbol of how she is going to transform. She is going to thoroughly investigate and pass her own test, proving that she deserves to be happy and make herself feel truly at home in this new place.
626	9490	4	3	The author concluded this paragraph in the story because it was showing that there are geese that typically hang around the beautiful garden during the pleasant spring time, adding a touch of natural charm to the scene.
627	9491	4	3	The author in this well - crafted story explains how extremely hard some life - changing changes can be. The author also elaborates on how family and objects from home such as the delicate flower can offer a great deal of comfort. The meaning of the story is to vividly show one of the author's personal experiences in life.
628	9492	4	3	I think the author concludes this part of the story because he wanted to clearly let the reader know that it wasn't over for the little girl and she was firmly not going to give up on planting flowers. And that when the spring arrives and the snow has completely melted, she was going to plant some more flowers and see how they will thrive during the spring. Even though it didn't work as well as in the winter season, she didn't let that stop her. I think what the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn't work out, keep on trying, maybe something different and better will happen.
629	9493	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again.” She does this to clearly show that she still holds onto hope, and won't just easily give up. She went through a great deal of hardship when she moved, and seemed to have a palpable sense of depression throughout the story. After all her sadness within the story, she finally gathers the energy back to tell herself, “Keep trying.” “I will take that test again.” (which shows hope). “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously deeply upset because the plant strongly reminds her of home. As a conclusion, I thought that it was a very wise and impactful choice to end the passage with a positive attitude.
630	9494	4	3	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many valid reasons. One reason is because it leaves you with the clear understanding that Saeng will never give up trying, no matter what obstacles come her way. Another reason is that something as seemingly simple as a flower can strongly encourage someone to keep going even if they feel they have nothing else to strive for. Saeng says that the flower is something so incredibly important, that working harder will inspire her to keep doing the best she possibly can. The author leaves you with this powerful sentence because it effectively brings Saeng the much - needed courage to face the future.
631	9495	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because she had already failed the test and earnestly wanted to pass it the next time. So, she hoped to not make her mother disappointed in her.
632	9496	4	3	I think what the narrator means by saying this is that she wants to come back when everything is beautiful again. She wants to patiently wait for all of the snow to melt and the geese to return so she can see all the vivid colors of the flowers. And if she passes her test this time, she will get to drive past all the lovely flowers. That's what I think the character means in this story.
633	9497	4	3	The author of this story ends the story with this paragraph because it clearly explains how Saeng will not give up, just as the resilient hibiscus does not. Earlier in the story, it elaborately explains how the winter hibiscus does not die. In the paragraph, when it says, “the snows melt,” this means that the seasons will keep going steadily, just as Saeng should keep going forward and trying. Also, when the author says “and the geese return,” this means that the geese will keep coming back regularly just as Saeng should keep trying to take the test.
634	9498	4	3	I believe the author used these lines in the last paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” It seems the author really liked the symbolic meaning these lines conveyed.
635	9499	4	3	I think the author concludes those paragraphs to show more profound meaning of the story. The author could have wanted to show more in - depth details in the story to make it more engaging and meaningful for the readers.
636	9500	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to vividly show how she will start afresh by retaking the test, just as the resilient hibiscus will start over by budding new, vibrant flowers. Saeng clearly shows us how she will bravely try to overcome the numerous obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and the determined geese will overcome the harsh winter. In the story, the author artfully makes the hibiscus represent the effective way to adjust to the inevitable changes in life. In a meaningful way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is steadily adapting to the difficult circumstances, the circumstance being the cold winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her significant obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam to move forward in her new life.
637	9501	4	3	ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the gentle snows melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is budding with new life, then I will take that test again.î is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In my opinion, the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to clearly show that Saeng is deeply committed to adjusting well to her new home and to leaving her old one behind. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say ìI mean, not like the kind we had at home.î without suddenly bursting into tears. This vividly illustrates her profound sorrow and her initial inability to let go of her past, but her vow shows her growing strength.
638	9502	4	3	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many valid reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to clearly show that Saeng truly cared about adapting well to her new place and was not a failure or a quitter. The author also probably finished the story this way to effectively show that Saeng was highly determined for success and to make her loving mother happy. This is precisely why the author finished the story with the paragraph, to highlight Saeng's positive qualities and her hopeful future.
639	9503	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small but significant glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus tenderly reminds her of her beloved homeland, Vietnam, which fills her with a sense of warmth and pleasure. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can bravely survive the cold winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, powerfully symbolizes Saengís strong determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus, with its potential to bloom again, symbolizes Saengís survival and successful adaptation to her new country, which will include her confidently retaking her driving test.
640	9504	4	3	The author concludes her story with this statement for many important reasons. First, the Hibiscus will be strong again when the fierce wind stops blowing. Therefore, Saeng will be strong too, drawing strength from the flower's resilience. Also, Saeng is giving herself a reasonable amount of time to gradually adjust and get used to her new, unfamiliar surroundings. She is setting a realistic and achievable goal for herself. Saeng is closely identifying with the flower. It gives her a deep sense of comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her truly happy, like her beautiful home country, and her kind - hearted grandmother. This connection with the hibiscus helps her face the challenges of her new life.
641	9505	4	3	"The author of this story concludes it with this particular paragraph to vividly show Saeng's determination. As I read, I notice this hibiscus in the story. When Saeng sees the plant, she is immediately filled with joy and is extremely happy. However, the memories of doing her grandmother's hair keep tugging at her, yet she tries her best to push through. She views this as a test for herself. She wants to see if she could move on and not dwell on the past. When she isn't at home, she says, ""I failed the test."" This shows that what she truly wants is to move on, but it hasn't been as easy as she hoped it would be. So, when this hibiscus symbolizes life in this paragraph, it clearly shows that Saeng is trying to move on, and she is different from her former self in an English - speaking environment."
642	9506	4	3	In the story, I firmly believe Saeng is deeply sad because she greatly misses her home and the beautiful hibiscus flower. She ends the story in a very good way because she can now attain a sense of inner peace with herself by patiently waiting to take the test again. I believe that's precisely why she ended the story like she did, so she doesn't leave herself in a state of worry or anger. She has the remarkable ability to turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This shows her resilience and hope for a better future.
643	9507	4	3	"The author concludes with this sentence because it clearly shows that Saeng is going to earnestly try to adapt to her new home. He makes it known that Saeng is not going to keep grieving and being sad anymore, but she will bravely adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: ""I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at - "". This occurs when Saeng has just come home and had a talk with her mother, and she is extremely sad because she thought about the old memories at her old home. However, by adding the last statement of the story, it vividly shows that Saeng has made the decision to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a clear goal to accept her new situation. This is the exact reason for the author to conclude his story like he does."
644	9508	4	3	"Many authors end their stories in different and unique ways. But Minfong Ho ended hers with almost a profound saying. One reason she ended her story this way was that she kind of subtly revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. Like in the end, it says, ""I will take that test again."" This clearly lets the reader know that she, the author, might write another story about Saeng, specifically when she takes the test again. A second example is showing that Saeng is strong and beautiful and will bravely try again. This is shown when the author said, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" Notice she said ""this hibiscus"" which is referring to Saeng. Without some of these writing techniques and subtle hints, we might not know if there will be a sequel and what might happen in Saeng's life next."
645	9509	4	3	The author must have put this in the story to clearly show change. For all the things we give and do, we are, in a way, replenishing the author's vision. People often don't think about the small damages that come along with the big changes. The small ones actually count; they are the turning points. I have to keep this in mind. On top of that, the old challenges are like obstacles to drive through. We all go through harsh times, both big and small, but we need to have the courage and determination to overcome them all. Only by doing so can we truly grow and move forward in life.
646	9510	4	3	This is a very important paragraph for the narrator to put in the story. For instance, Saeng is clearly stating that her new home filled with her beloved flowers holds more significance than school and an upcoming test. And, Saeng doesn't have a large circle of friends to visit at school, but her hibiscus will vividly remind her of all the old friends she made in the past. Saeng is simply reassuring herself that once everything returns to normal, or the way she desires it to be, then she can retake that test. In conclusion, the narrator used this paragraph to let us know how deeply Saeng feels about her situation and her hopes for the future.
647	9511	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively concludes and neatly wraps up the entire narrative. It vividly shows the intricate relationship between nature, the process of adapting, and how all these elements worked together to calm her down after the disappointment of failing the test. This conclusion ties up the loose ends and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the story's message.
648	9512	4	3	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter as it transitions into spring, the thick layer of snow will gradually melt away. The trees and flowers, which had been dormant during the cold months, will then blossom into a riot of different colored flowers. After all the flowers have blossomed beautifully, the lush leaves will come out, and then the fine pollen will find the right kind of trees to fertilize. At the end of @DATE2 as the season turns into fall, the leaves start to lose their vitality and change color from vivid greens to warm oranges, reds, and yellows. Then the leaves will gently fall off the branches. Finally, it snows all over again, starting the cycle anew.
649	9513	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because it clearly shows that Saeng isn't going to let failure keep her down. It shows that just as the hibiscus will overcome the harsh winter, like Saeng’s mother says, “...but it's strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus That’s what matters.” This vividly symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only the setback of failing the driver’s test but also the major challenge of moving to @LOCATION1. She is no longer the same as she was back home, but she has the inner strength to get through this significant change in her life. Also, taking the test in the spring symbolizes a fresh start, when everything is new, and she has successfully overcome her personal “winter” of difficulties. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng’s firm promise to herself that she will persevere through the challenges in front of her and those to come. When Saeng says “...When the snows melt...” it powerfully symbolizes the time in her life when her past failures will turn into something positive again. She will take the test with a brand - new outlook on her life. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is determined and resilient, refusing to stay down.
650	9514	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the thick layer of snows gradually melts and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus begins budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because Saeng failed the test. Saeng failed to find the fine - toothed comb, the beautiful hibiscus hedge, the old well, and her gentle grandmother. Apparently, these things could be found after the snows have completely melted, the geese have returned in large flocks, and the hibiscus is in full bud, symbolizing a new beginning and the possibility of finding what she lost.
651	9515	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show Saeng’s outlook on the future. It serves as a truly fitting conclusion, carefully drawing from numerous well - crafted elements in the story, and it clearly shows how Saeng has maturely grown. Saeng refers to “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” In this evocative phrase, she shows a growing acceptance and even a deep - seated affection for her new homeland. The geese, which were once seen as “strange” by Saeng, are now “familiar to Saeng”. The hibiscus is a precious piece of her past, cleverly adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng’s vow that she will “take that test again” in the spring, “When the snows melt… etc.” This shows that despite losing so much - her beloved home, her dear grandmother, her accustomed way of life - Saeng is still firmly determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what challenges come her way. The concluding paragraph is an ideal way to wrap up the story. It effectively shows how the threads of Saeng’s past and her present are intricately entwined, and displays her positive attitude towards the future. With its hopeful and optimistic words, the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author’s wording was very well - chosen and skillfully crafted.
652	9516	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story it clearly says ""I will take that test again."" This statement indicates that she's trying to show how much she has adjusted to the various changes in life. In the story, it also specifically states ""when they come back"". This clearly concludes that when the flowers come back next season, she will see how much she remembers about her homeland, her dear grandma, and all the wonderful and good things from her past. This ending effectively leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation about her self - discovery journey."
653	9517	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know that there will be another engaging story that will be made up. Also, to subtly show that Saeng was not overjoyed when the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus was budding. Perhaps these natural changes brought back bittersweet memories for her, and the author uses this to set a tone for the potential follow - up story. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of curiosity about what lies ahead for Saeng.
654	9518	4	3	Now that she has gained a significant amount of knowledge about plants, the narrator makes it seem like the girl is deeply interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world is filled with different plants that bloom and look incredibly beautiful in the season. So, the way I see it is that the girl truly enjoys the plants and their unique characteristics. To me, I can say that she is an adventurous girl who loves to explore new worlds and discover what is out there to be explained. Her interest in plants is a gateway to her exploration of the unknown, and it shows her inquisitive and open - minded nature.
655	9519	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng can overcome her weaknesses and achieve success in her new home. The statement “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It means she’ll bravely try the @CAPS2 Test again and also attempt new tests to make herself feel at home where she is and learn what she can @CAPS3 from it. This ending gives the impression that Saeng is ready to face new challenges and grow in her new environment.
656	9520	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The first reason is to clearly show that Saeng is a determined young girl. By firmly vowing to take the “test” again, despite any setbacks, she vividly demonstrates her determination and refusal to give up. Another reason is that the author wanted to emphasize the significance of the idea of Saeng's personality, which is a key aspect in understanding the story's message. This way, the author effectively wraps up the story while highlighting Saeng's admirable traits.
657	9521	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this particular part because it effectively shows Saeng's strong determination to pass the driver's test. The fact that she failed the test initially made her feel quite bad, and it also brought out strong feelings of homesickness, much like the sight of the familiar plant did. However, in this final paragraph, she firmly vows that she will overcome all the challenges of being in an unfamiliar place. She will pull herself together to achieve her goal, just as the winter hibiscus manages to survive in its less - than - ideal environment. This conclusion neatly ties up the themes of perseverance and adaptation in the story.
658	9522	4	3	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was an extremely determined girl. She had a steadfast resolve and would keep trying repeatedly until she got things right. No matter how long the process might take or how difficult the task would be, she was committed to getting it done. Just like the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway, it seemed completely out of place in that setting, but it would do whatever it could to survive. Being strong during times when you can only rely on yourself is indeed a difficult thing to do. However, Saeng draws determination from her past losses and the resilience shown by the perfect - looking Hibiscus flower, which serves as an inspiration for her to keep going.
659	9523	4	3	In the concluding statement, Saeng states that “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story with this passage because she is skillfully using the hibiscus as a powerful example of survival. The hibiscus is from another place, just like Saeng herself, and she is using it to symbolize her well - being in the new place. In a way, she is saying, if the hibiscus can survive this harsh winter, then so can she. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to clearly depict her somewhat unsure nature towards her new home, while also showing her hope for a better future.
660	9524	4	3	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome difficulties and be strong even though she deeply misses her home. For example, Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibiscus plant, she considered it a form of failure. Yet, she also believes that she will gradually get stronger over time. This final paragraph encapsulates Saeng's journey of self - growth and her determination to adapt to a new environment despite the emotional challenges, thus providing a fitting end to the story.
661	9525	4	3	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to neatly sum up the realization and determination that Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out extremely upset after failing her important test. When she unexpectedly sees the flower and then goes to find it at a local shop, she is completely overwhelmed by this small yet powerful reminder of her old home. That small, delicate flower made her deeply realize how much she missed her old home, and buying it becomes an absolute necessity for her. She probably felt that with that flower, she would always have a little, precious piece of home in this newer, unfamiliar world. After realizing that memories are what's truly important and seeing that flower's remarkable determination to survive a cold, harsh winter, she develops the firm determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained unwavering faith from the flower's survival and her profound realization of important memories. All in all, that ending paragraph reveals these specific, meaningful messages.
662	9526	4	3	The reason the author was inspired was because of the resilient flower. The flower had the remarkable ability to survive harsh, frigid winters and adapt well to new, unfamiliar environments. She decides that she was going to overcome her obstacles just as the flower overcomes its obstacles every long, cold winter. This shows how the flower's tenacity served as a powerful motivation for the author to face her own challenges with courage.
663	9527	4	3	Memory, promise, life - all are significant ideas that explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Memories is one key idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph because Saeng deeply misses her old life and her native country. Promise is another important idea because Saeng makes a solemn vow that once spring, with its warm and gentle breeze, comes again she will take the test again. Life is another crucial idea because Saeng bought the flower and carefully planted it so it can thrive once spring has arrived, and she said then she will retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the vibrant spring along with the promises she has made and the new life that wants to start, and Saeng is doing this by planting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her precious memories from her past life.
664	9528	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder, and the cold was intensifying. All the plants and flowers were going to die as the freezing temperatures took hold. This change in the weather set a somber tone, and the author's concluding statement might be related to this impending loss in the natural world.
665	9529	4	3	Reasons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes it because she was very eager on passing the test. She told herself firmly and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return, flying gracefully in the sky, and the snow melts, revealing the earth beneath. Another reason I think the author concludes this is because she failed it the first time and it is a big, significant thing for her and she is very eager on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story as it shows the character's strong determination and hope for a better outcome.
666	9530	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng had unfortunately failed her driver's test. As she dejectedly walked home, she caught sight of a flower that vividly reminded her of what was once her home. She decided to buy the flower and then returned to her new home where her mother was busy working in the garden. They jointly decided to plant the flower in the garden. Just as the flower was planted, a flock of geese flew overhead. At that moment, Saeng suddenly realized that everything around her now felt familiar, although it had all seemed quite strange to her before. She concluded the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring, she will take the test again. She mentions that the flower will be “buckling”, which means blooming or growing, and by then she will have grown accustomed to everything. So, she will be ready for the test when the geese are ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom.
667	9531	4	3	The author does this because they are making a comparison to the plant. Specifically, when the plant starts to bloom, it symbolizes that the character's confidence will gradually come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it imparts some profound meaning to the story, making the reader understand the relationship between the plant's growth and the character's emotional state.
668	9532	4	3	The author concludes this story with the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it appear more captivating. By doing so, it entices the reader, making them eager for the story to continue so that they can find out what happens next. This ending effectively creates a sense of anticipation, leaving the reader with a lingering curiosity about the subsequent events.
669	9533	4	3	I think this author put this last paragraph in this story to show everyone how resolute she is to pass this test. Passing this test means a great deal to her, as it might represent a new beginning or a step towards independence. That is precisely what I believe is the reason why the author would include this in the story, to convey the character's strong determination and the significance of the test to her.
670	9534	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it clearly shows the connection between nature and the girl. The paragraph states, “...when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (No @NUM1). In spring, when all of these events occur, it is a remarkable time. Spring is well - known as the sign of life, birth, or renewal. The geese come back, and in a symbolic sense, they are “renewed”. When the snow melts, the grass reappears, which is an obvious sign of life. When plants bud, it is as if they are being born anew. The character decides that when nature is symbolically reborn and renewed, she will also start afresh, just like nature, taking a new step forward in her life.
671	9535	4	3	He concludes the story with his paragraph because he wanted to clearly convey that he was going to take the test again when it was not the winter. As @CAPS1 indicates, this shows a sense of determination. Just like Saeng vowed to herself, stating that he or she will take the test again when it is not winter. Even though @CAPS2 the test was not passed in winter, it could have been passed during the time when the snow melted on the ground. This conclusion gives a message of hope and perseverance.
672	9536	4	3	In the story, the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had carefully read the rest of the story, you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back. She specifically wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather compared to the first time she took it. The first - time test - taking might have been in harsh conditions that affected her performance. Another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what the protagonist was really going for in the novel. So, the author first wanted to make sure the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reasons why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel, helping the readers fully grasp the story's essence.
673	9537	4	3	Because they were eager to get it done with, they made the end of the story resemble the first part. This kind of circular structure gives the story a sense of wholeness. I particularly like the part when the birds came back. It was a sign of new life and renewal. Along with the return of the birds, some of the flowers also came back to them. This part added a touch of beauty and hope to the story, making it more engaging and memorable.
674	9538	4	3	Saeng and her mother have to be extremely determined to try their best in order to survive. They have been through a great deal, facing numerous challenges in a new and unfamiliar place. When Saeng failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before as this setback added to their struggles. The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought of how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place. Even though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland, they still cherish and enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the beautiful flowers, the spicy hot peppers, and the unique bitter melons. Her friends may disagree with the taste, but it doesn't stop her from enjoying what she loves most. This shows their strong connection to their roots and their ability to find joy in the midst of difficulties.
675	9539	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will surely pass that test. She made a solemn vow to herself, which is a powerful display of determination to overcome the obstacle. It, as @MONTH1 implies, also makes us eager to read more and find out if she will test her vow and if she passed the test. For example, it ends with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.” This ending leaves the readers with a sense of anticipation, wondering about the outcome of her future attempt.
676	9540	4	3	The author concluded the story in this way because she held another perspective of Saeng. She believed that Saeng would think that in every season, she would be in a different mood, and @CAPS1 indicated that the garden would transform accordingly. As a result, Saeng's mom would always be outside to enjoy each season.
677	9541	4	3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For instance, Saeng failed her driver's test, but when she reached the hibiscus plant, it vividly reminded her of her old home. Moreover, while she was carefully planting the plant, she observed the geese with a new sense of familiarity. This combination of experiences makes her determined to complete her test. Having two reminders of both her old and new homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and also treasure her precious memories.
678	9542	4	3	He was saying that you should not give up easily and that you should keep persevering, just like the plants in the springtime. Despite facing challenges such as cold spells or lack of nutrients, the plants keep growing and striving to bloom. Similarly, in our lives, we should maintain a positive attitude and keep trying.
679	9543	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is making a firm promise to herself to take the test again so that she can finally pass it. She has decided that she will do it when spring arrives and the hibiscus is budding, a time full of hope and new beginnings. She realizes that she needs to take the test and start driving to gain more independence. I think it is a good thing when people vow things to themselves as it shows self - determination and a clear goal.
680	9544	4	3	He is referring to the lifestyle of Saeng and the various activities they engage in. For example, they might have regular gardening routines or community gatherings. Additionally, he is talking about what the area is like in terms of weather. Whether it is often sunny, rainy, or has distinct seasonal changes all play a part in shaping their daily lives.
681	9545	4	3	The author decided to finish the story with that specific phrase deliberately to show that she will patiently wait for her next year and meticulously do all this over again. She will be eagerly waiting for it, with a steadfast determination, and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove with unwavering resolve that she can do it one more time and that she is now accustomed to living there.
682	9546	4	3	The author concludes this story in such a way to vividly show a new beginning in the spring. Just like how delicate flowers bloom and bud gracefully in spring, she will transform into a new and better person. That is precisely why the author concludes the story like this, leaving a sense of hope and renewal.
683	9547	4	3	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph to clearly show that Saeng will bravely try the test again and obtain a fresh new start. Also, I firmly think that it's showing the reader that if you fail something the first time, don't be afraid to go back with courage and try it again. I also believe that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the cold winter and doesn't like the situation she's in. But in the warm spring when the hibiscus has budding buds on it, she's going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new and suitable environment to thrive in, just as she will find a new path forward.
684	9548	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it artfully leaves you to interpret and carefully decide. It doesn't straightforwardly come out and tell you what the test was specifically for or even if she passed it successfully, that's for you to thoughtfully decide. It also leaves you curiously wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you imaginatively want it to be, it is up for your unique interpretation. To different people, it could indeed mean different and meaningful things, adding a layer of depth to the story.
685	9549	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph precisely says when she is going to courageously try to take the test and make positive changes in her ever - changing life. For example, she is deeply sad in the story because she failed the test and desperately wants to go home. If she passes in the beautiful spring, she might actively try to make changes and happily live here. This is exactly why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, hinting at the possibility of a new chapter in her life.
686	9550	4	3	The author concludes the story with this well - crafted paragraph to vividly show that Saeng is finally comfortable with her new “home.” After the passage mostly serves as a deep reflection of Saeng’s old life, it ends in this manner to clearly signify that she has become fully accustomed to her new way of life. For instance, it says “in the spring, and the geese return…” This simple yet powerful description shows that she is now used to the geese and the natural beauty of her new world. The author also deftly uses that paragraph at the end to convey a strong sense of release. Saeng had so many precious memories locked inside her old life that she initially couldn't grasp new ones in her new home. The author's use of this paragraph is an excellent way to close out the story because it allows the reader to vividly feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; it's as if Saeng is escaping her pain and finally becoming a real part of her new world. This ending leaves a lasting impression on the reader, highlighting Saeng's journey of adaptation and acceptance.
687	9551	4	3	This last paragraph reveals something truly special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope through her mother's understanding and the hibiscus plant. Initially, she felt hopeless, miserable, and out - of - place upon seeing the hibiscus that so vividly reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant firmly buried in the ground gave her a new sense of determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, which in Saeng's case symbolizes hard times. The roots are her past and although they are buried deep in the ground, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a brand - new life for Saeng in a new country. The author, Minfong Ho, skillfully gave personification or humanizing qualities to non - living things in the story. This is precisely why the author used the last paragraph and structured it in the way she did, adding depth and emotional resonance to the narrative.
688	9552	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to clearly show Saeng's determination. It is also cleverly relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is suggesting that when everything else in nature starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something significant. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her forward. Throughout the story, Saeng is deeply affected by her surroundings. For example, when she's in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood in a very vivid way. “It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” This connection between her and the environment emphasizes how important her surroundings are in shaping her journey and her ability to achieve her goals.
689	9553	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng finds great comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant serves as a powerful reminder of home and connects her with her past experiences. Even though she failed the test the first time, she firmly believes that if she studies hard and tries again, she can pass. This situation connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter, the plant appears to die, but then come spring, it is beautiful and blossoms again. Saeng feels a strong connection with the plant's rebirth and feels that she can also start over again and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph where Saeng vows to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms. This inclusion highlights Saeng's resilience and hope for a better future."
690	9554	4	3	"The main reason why the author concludes the story saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" is quite significant. The author ended it like that because Saeng is basically saying that the right time will come for her to take that test. She firmly believes that she will pass it with self - belief. This ending shows Saeng's patience and her understanding that time and nature play important roles in her ability to succeed. It leaves the reader with a sense of optimism about Saeng's future and her ability to overcome challenges."
691	9555	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a poignant way to convey that in due season, she will retake the test that she previously failed. She holds the firm belief that the hibiscus, a symbol of hope and resilience, will assist her in overcoming the obstacles that once hindered her. I believe that she purchased the plant right after she failed the test, perhaps seeking solace and a sign of better times. She hopes that with the blossoming of the plant, it will serve as a natural timetable, indicating to her when she is truly ready to try again and face the test with newfound confidence.
692	9556	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it serves as a meaningful and comprehensive summary of the events that unfolded in the story. Everything that happened to Saeng while she was at the florist is neatly summed up into something that resembles a form of vengeance, a determination to overcome her setbacks. The whole reason that Saeng was initially sad was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she makes a solemn vow to take the test again when the hibiscus begins to bud. The hibiscus that Saeng bought will start budding in the spring, a time when the snows gradually melt and nature comes back to life. The last paragraph of the story provides room for Saeng to deal with her nostalgia over the long winter season. Finally, the geese that fly south make Saeng feel a pang of sadness, but they also light a spark within her. She tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows completely melt, marking a new beginning and a chance for redemption.
693	9557	4	3	In the last paragraph, they are clearly trying to express what the future holds. When the harsh winter is finally over, the gentle spring will arrive, which means the hibiscus will come back to life, blooming in all its glory. It will be like a piece of home, a familiar and comforting sight. Also, the geese will return from their long - distance migration. Because of these signs of new life and renewal, she will take the quiz again. To her, it's like starting all over, wiping the slate clean and approaching the challenge with fresh hope. She sincerely hopes that this time, she will pass the quiz. Also, she has a deep love for the hibiscus. Since it will be back, maybe she will perform so much better, drawing strength and inspiration from its resilience. Overall, a new and promising time is coming, filled with the possibility of success.
694	9558	4	3	"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because it is vividly showing us the importance of the plant and how it will act as a guiding light to help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant bravely buds and fights all the harsh obstacles to survive the cold winter, then she will have the strength and determination to beat the obstacles and pass her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return"", the author is subtly relating this to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test, just like these natural elements struggling to survive the winter. It also says ""Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly disappearing into the distance"". This quote is a clear indication that she will rise to her challenge with courage and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again"" is significant because it is showing the similar and arduous struggles between the flower, Saeng, and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what they started, highlighting the power of perseverance."
695	9559	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is rich in meaning. The author is subtly saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance to thrive and fulfill their natural cycles, she too, will get her chance to succeed. For example, the geese will get to return to their familiar habitats after their long migration, the hibiscus will get its chance to bud and bloom after enduring the cold winter, and she will get her chance to take her driver's test. I know this because Saeng’s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring, painting a picture of its future beauty. She even says, “But it's strong enough to make it through the cold months”. This indicates that the mom is gently trying to tell her daughter that she will get a second chance, just like the hibiscus. That is why the story ends with that sentence, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and the promise of a new beginning.
696	9560	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it's telling about the seasons and how they change in a cyclical manner. They start off with a new season, and then there's something different. Each season brings its own unique characteristics. I think that's why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus. After spring comes winter. When it was spring, they had all the nice, beautiful flowers that smelled good. And when spring is gone and winter arrives, all the plants have died out and they're not going to be the same as they used to be. This seasonal change reflects the story's themes and gives it a sense of natural progression.
697	9561	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up; she keeps trying persistently. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that holds an extraordinary meaning. “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” By saying this, Saeng shows her determination to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland deeply. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it effectively strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words, which encapsulate Saeng's spirit and the essence of the story.
698	9562	4	3	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype clearly shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt well to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she vividly remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her a strong sense of hope, and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her the hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while still remembering her old home in Vietnam fondly.
699	9563	4	3	The author concludes the sentence at the end to state that when the plants start over - growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their petals back carefully, and the geese have to make their home and find food again in their usual way. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again. This connection between nature's renewal and her attempt at the test gives the story a sense of harmony and a message of hope and perseverance.
700	9564	4	3	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back inside the house to get a dinner. And since she isn't going to see the garden until the other day, and because winter has come, she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” That quotation clearly explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It ties together the elements of seasonal change, the character's in - house situation during winter, and her future plans, creating a cohesive and meaningful ending.
701	9565	4	3	I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this particular statement is because, upon careful thought, it is kind of a solution. And logically, you don't place the solution anywhere else but at the end. That is precisely why she put it there, as it provides a fitting conclusion to the matter at hand.
702	9566	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. By doing so, the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she has found a hobby to look forward to. An example is “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it; overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by”. This vivid imagery emphasizes Saeng's new - found hope. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it encapsulates Saeng's positive outlook.
703	9567	4	3	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty and marvels of nature. Saeng spent a significant amount of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng - nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test to get a license but was failing it. During her test, she chanced upon that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still mustered the courage to show her mother the flower she found, which was different from the one at home. Her mother, being understanding, was pleased with the flowers and understood that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, “Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters”. This was a figurative speech suggesting that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she has learned more and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring, it clearly signifies a fresh new start at success, which is what Saeng is aiming for.
704	9568	4	3	The author concludes this way because currently, when it is cold and unpleasant outside, it is not a suitable time to take the test. However, when it gets warm and nice outside, they will go to take the test again. The harsh weather conditions now act as a deterrent, but the approaching pleasant weather will provide a more favorable environment for the test - taking, thus motivating them to attempt it once more.
705	9569	4	3	It is actually a very powerful last statement. Even though she failed her driver's test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will “return” to take her test with a determined mindset to pass. Saeng bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and it filled that void in her heart where she missed her homeland. “I paid nineteen dollars for it,” she says. She says it in a tone that shows she is disappointed in failing the test, and also highlights that something which is free back in Vietnam was so expensive in the United States. A hibiscus flower is tropical, and when it blooms in the spring, it symbolizes her readiness to give the test a second try. This blooming represents her personal growth and the renewal of her hope for success.
706	9570	4	3	The author concludes the story with this ending because it vividly shows that if the plant manages to come back and bloom, then she will resolutely go back and take the test, making a determined effort to pass this time. She is fully aware that it is going to be an arduous task for her to come back and pass this test. However, she firmly believes she can do it, just as she is certain that the plant will fight tenaciously through the harsh winter and come back to bloom beautifully in the spring. This parallel gives her a strong sense of confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can endure the tough winter they are currently going through. As a result, this well - thought - out ending is why the author chose to conclude the story in such a way, leaving a powerful and inspiring message.
707	9571	4	3	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by stating that she will retake the driver's test because not only will she have another go at the driver's test, but she will also gradually become more at ease in her life. The driver's test is not the root cause of her problems; rather, it is the challenge of adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much emotional pain. For example, in lines @NUM1, Saeng's thoughts are described as ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stung Saeng’s eyes now and swept over her” and “in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” This clearly depicts that Saeng is having a difficult time readjusting to her new life. The memories of her old home resurface, and she cries because those days are gone. I think that failing her driver's test was just the final straw that made her break down due to the accumulated stress. When she said “and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,” it means that she is determined to overcome all these difficulties and move forward with her life."
708	9572	4	3	It was a wise choice that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng had a deep affection for the hibiscus. So, when spring arrives and the hibiscus bursts into bloom, it will be the perfect moment for her to retake the test after having failed it previously. The blooming of the hibiscus would likely instill in her a greater sense of confidence to face the driving test again at the right time. The symbolic connection between the hibiscus and her test - taking journey makes this ending meaningful. So in conclusion, that is precisely why the author chose to conclude the story with this well - crafted paragraph.
709	9573	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because she is suggesting that she is going to grow and develop along with the changing seasons. She finds herself in a new country and has just suffered the disappointment of failing her driver's test. She is feeling dejected, but the hibiscus serves as a powerful reminder of her home back in her native land. In the story, @CAPS1 mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake; it’s strong enough to make it through the winter.” I think that Saeng can draw a parallel to this. If the flower can survive the harsh winter, then she can surely make it in this new country, facing all the challenges and adapting to the new environment with resilience.
710	9574	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author finishes the story with this last paragraph: “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had bought a hibiscus plant as it had strongly reminded her of her hometown. As described, “Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” So she decided to purchase it. However, due to the bad weather at that time, Saeng had to get the plant back promptly and plant it in the garden. Unfortunately, she failed to do so in a timely manner. That is the reason behind her statement “I will take that test again.” She is determined to take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blossoms once more, symbolizing a new beginning and a chance for success. That is why the author chose to end the story with this significant paragraph, leaving a hopeful and inspiring note.
711	9575	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it clearly shows that she, during @MONTH1, is not going to give up. I believe this @MONTH1 because she made a silent vow to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring. Also, it seems there might be some confusion in the original text; perhaps it was about the challenges not being insurmountable. In conclusion, the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this is to emphasize her determination.
712	9576	4	3	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, “When they come back, ‘Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.’” The reason for this is so she will have sufficient time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this new environment and situation are completely new to her. These words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, “Almost familiar to her now. Like geese.” This comparison helps to convey Saeng's sense of familiarity and the gradual process of adaptation.
713	9577	4	3	It is almost spring, just like he said. The snow is melting, and the geese are returning. The hibiscus is budding, the grass is growing, and the trees are budding. The @CAPS1 are singing cheerfully, filling the air with their sweet melodies. All these signs bring a sense of renewal and new beginnings, truly depicting the arrival of spring.
714	9578	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with an interesting paragraph. The paragraph says “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone. She had moved to a new country and missed everything, like the flowers and the Hibiscus. So she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test. In the text it states “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She was realizing that it wasn't so bad, and she was gradually getting used to this new place, which shows her resilience and the process of adaptation.
715	9579	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending is crafted so that the audience has something meaningful to think about. It gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect, leaving the readers to ponder Saeng's determination and the hope associated with the coming spring and the retaking of the test.
716	9580	4	3	The author concludes the story in this manner to vividly show that she will be alright and will steadfastly remain determined. The positive way she speaks of future times clearly shows her confidence that she will successfully make it till spring. The resolute way she speaks of the test further reflects her unwavering determination. The deliberate use of the word “vowed” strongly shows that she will surely follow through with her statement, highlighting her commitment.
717	9581	4	3	The author concluded the story with this particular sentence because she is clearly letting people know that she genuinely enjoys the beauty and tranquility of nature far more than the structured environment of school. This final statement effectively conveys her preference for the natural world.
718	9582	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the flower, the hibiscus, is mentioned and told about all through the story. The author specifically puts in the text that when the hibiscus is budding, then “I will take that test again.” This connection between the flower's growth and the test gives a unique ending to the story.
719	9583	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she is clearly telling us what will happen beyond the story we are currently reading. It specifically means that when the snow melts and the cold season passes, she'll start all over again with enthusiasm and rebuild the greenhouse. This ending gives a sense of hope and new beginnings.
720	9584	4	3	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to clearly show determination. I also firmly believe that it symbolizes adaption, as when the season changes, just like nature transforms, so will Saeng. She will bravely take the test again. Everything will soon gradually go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. As the text states, everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1), indicating that she is on the path of adaptation and recovery.
721	9585	4	3	The author concludes with this ending because it provides a glimmer of hope, much like a ray of sunshine breaking through storm clouds. It is akin to a happy ending to a sad story, offering a sense of relief and optimism. It serves as her final thought for the story and a perfect end point, leaving the readers with a positive feeling.
722	9586	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph in the story at this point because that's when she begins growing plants once again. She yearns to start over anew, perhaps leaving behind past troubles and embracing a fresh beginning.
723	9587	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly explains that Saeng will make another attempt once spring arrives. For instance, the line “I failed the test,” (Ho) clearly shows that Saeng did indeed fail the test, yet she still managed to get her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mother, feeling sorry about Saeng's failure, cooks her delicious food to make her feel better and help her try to forget about the setback. This is highly important as it gives Saeng a sense of comfort and relief, knowing that she can take the test again with confidence.
724	9588	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of several causes. Saeng silently vowed to herself, which indicates that she has already calmed down. She has started to feel more at ease in her new country. She senses the arrival of spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, and she firmly says that she will take that test again. This shows that she no longer feels bad about the test. She is aware that she has the opportunity to take it again and do better. She has a different perspective on her problem and views her new country with fresh eyes. All aspects of her life are getting better. These are the reasons that explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.
725	9589	4	3	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to vividly show that she will make another attempt with a brand - new start. When she sees the flower, the clerk tells her it is a hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back warm memories of her childhood. She then carefully takes it home and proudly shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a surprised “You what?” upon hearing her daughter tell her the price. With the hibiscus being something of great importance, she gains more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she clearly means she will try again with a new and fresh start.
726	9590	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show Saeng's unwavering determination despite her deep - seated sadness. She profoundly misses Vietnam, the land of her roots, but she firmly decides to take the test again next year. The author's careful choice of words in the concluding paragraph effectively conveys a palpable sense of hope and something tangible to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is greatly disappointed in herself for failing the test. However, buying the plant turns out to be a source of solace as it gently reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistently perseverant and the hopeful tone of the story are clearly expressed in this final paragraph, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
727	9591	4	3	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it seemed to be a truly important thought for ""Saeng"". This thought was basically the main cause of all the events in the story and the central subject around which the narrative revolved. She might also possibly have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and most poignant memory of her previous life and lifestyle before their present place of living. This memory serves as a powerful anchor, tying together the past and the present in the story."
728	9592	4	3	The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test due to an unwise decision. She spends her money on a big mac, leaving her without enough funds to buy the type of flower her mother sent for. So, since Saeng failed the test, she is determined to take the test again with the aim of making her mother happy and proving her capabilities.
729	9593	4	3	I believe that the author ended the story with that sentence because it provides a much - needed uplifting feeling after the story was filled with so much sadness. Saeng deeply missed her homeland, was drowning in sorrow, used the flowers as a source of relief, was heartbroken about her driving test, and truly adored the plant. So, the last sentence seems to fit in perfectly as a comforting zone, making the reader feel a bit more at ease and less burdened by the story's sadness. It leaves the reader with a glimmer of hope and a sense of lightness.
730	9594	4	3	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a strong tone of hope that effectively develops a theme. Final lines have a great impact on the reader because they are the last thing the reader reads, lingering in their minds. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the snow melts”. Here, the snow is symbolic of the deep sorrow she has been facing ever since she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng broke down and wept!”. The spring is a well - known time for archetypal rebirth. So, as “the snow will melt”, her sorrow will gradually go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, Saeng refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting and intimate connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also flourish because she will be comforted to the point where she feels a strong sense of security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a firm promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using the power of hope to show that we can overcome difficulties. She is showing great optimism toward the spring and is willing to bravely face a challenge. Therefore, the author conveys a life lesson of courage through these final lines.
731	9595	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends the story with this paragraph because it poignantly reveals the deep - seated importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story, Saeng makes the difficult move from Vietnam to a new place and constantly feels a strong sense of homesickness that gnaws at her. She takes her drivers test and fails, which leaves her extremely upset and dejected. As she is in this low state, when she sees the familiar Winter Hibiscus plant, it immediately transports her back to her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus vividly reminds Saeng of the fond memories she shared with her grandmother and simple yet precious things such as her fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would always leave soft red petals floating in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant, ìSaeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.î This clearly shows how deeply important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus serves as a great comfort to Saeng and will surely encourage her to prepare better and do better on her next driverís test.
732	9596	4	3	After reading ìWinter Hibiscus, I can clearly tell that Saeng is a determined person with a deep - seated love for nature. It is also evident that she is extremely determined to pass the driving test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story, Saeng takes her driving test and unfortunately fails. Disheartened, she decides to walk home. As she is slowly making her way home, she unexpectedly comes across a familiar plant. This encounter immediately takes her back to her childhood world filled with warmth and nostalgia. Had she not failed the test, she would have driven back and never walked home, which means she would have never come across the plant. The author didnít want us to forget the reason she walked home, as it was this failure that led to this significant encounter. It would have never happened if she had passed the test.
733	9597	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that next spring, Saeng will have another chance to succeed. The author skillfully shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms of the hibiscus plant and draw inspiration from them to take the test again. The author does this to leave a cliff - hanger, which effectively shows that there is more to Saengís life that is yet to unfold. In the story, Saeng is trying hard to get used to the changes in her life, and it is evident that she is having a tough time. Her mother tries her best to cheer her up, but just like the inevitable arrival of winter, Saeng has to face her setbacks. However, just as the hibiscus will bloom again in spring, Saeng will have next spring to take the driver's test again and prove herself.
734	9598	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back,Ö then I will take the test again"" because Saeng, much like the hibiscus, needs time to grow and develop. Saeng didn't perform well on the driving test, but she shows great resilience by saying she will try again after the snow melts and the spring arrives. After moving to a new place, Saeng often feels alone and frequently has the urge to go back home. However, deep in her heart, she believes that given time, she can face the challenges ahead. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of the flowers back in her home country, and this connection helps her realize that she has to let go of her past attachments and bravely live in the present moment, ready to embrace new opportunities."
735	9599	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively shows Saeng being mature about the situation and being extremely confident, knowing full well that she can take the test again. When it says ìSaeng vowed silently to herself,î it implies that she has carefully thought about everything that has happened. The phrase is almost like she is making a firm decision to start over. This shows that Saeng is not letting the failure define her but is instead using it as a motivation to improve and do better in the future. By ending the story with this, the author emphasizes Saeng's growth and her positive attitude towards facing challenges.
736	9600	4	3	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each symbolically represent something else. The geese represent change as they change their environment in the winter, much like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home since there are similar plants at her home. The hibiscus budding represents a new life, just as the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author ends with is used to show Saeng's life as compared to the geese and hibiscus, highlighting the themes of change and new beginnings.
737	9601	4	3	Saeng was happy when the snow was gradually disappearing because she couldn't wait for spring to fully come back. She was eager to see the animals running around by her garden and to watch the beautiful geese flying in after their long and hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grow back, as she believed that this would guarantee her to pass the test this time, marking a new and successful start in this season.
738	9602	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was eagerly waiting for the winter time to be completely over. After the winter time, Saeng is going to take a test again and she can plant the flower. Saeng really likes this hibiscus and she doesn't want it to die during the winter time. This conclusion ties in with Saeng's hopes and the cycle of seasons, showing her anticipation for a new start.
739	9603	4	3	The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted to show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there were a lot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at. Being in a new place that didn't have these flowers really got her down and made her upset. She missed her home so she was hurting, and the only thing that sort of comforted her a little bit were the flowers. For example, the girl says, “It’s - it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at...”, here she stops because she is so upset that she can't say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossoms in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her the confidence to retake the test, helping her to face the new environment with more courage.
740	9604	4	3	"The author's conclusion explains her feelings. The author's conclusion says to me ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test"" again. What it means is that she is a new woman. For example, taking the test means that she will undergo a change. Also, what it means is that she is ready to take on new things. For instance, the test to her is a symbol of getting ready to take on a new challenge. That's what I got from the conclusion, which clearly shows the character's growth and readiness for change."
741	9605	4	3	The author ends with this paragraph to vividly show that Saeng had hope. It clearly demonstrates that there is still a glimmer of hope in her situation. The ending paragraph subtly makes you kind of create your own unique ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big, flourishing garden next to her home, and she successfully passes the test with confidence. This imagined ending reflects the hope that the author implies through the paragraph, suggesting a positive future for Saeng.
742	9606	4	3	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several well - thought - out reasons. This final paragraph neatly draws together and unites all the elements of the concluding idea. It specifically tells us that in the spring, a season when everything is coming back to life, Saeng will find the inner strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in the last paragraph clearly show how Saeng and her mother have adapted to their new environment, and that new beginnings are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities arising. In the text it says, “I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This means and represents that even though life is very different here, away from Saeng's home in Vietnam, they will adapt and survive in their own resilient way, just like the winter hibiscus.
743	9607	4	3	The author concludes the story the way she does because it clearly shows that Saeng needs to fully heal from the disappointment of failing the test before she can take it again. Saeng already has the self - awareness that she can heal. She realizes that she has gradually gotten used to where she now lives. Things in her new land, like the gentle sound of geese flying overhead, are now “familiar to her”. The narrator of the story says, “...she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become … almost familiar to her now.” Things in Saeng's new home had been so strange to her at first, but she has healed and grown accustomed to them. Saeng has also healed from the pain of leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was deeply sad to leave her home, “A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her,” but with time, she had healed. Saeng remembers the flowers that she had known in Vietnam as “old friends”, showing that it no longer hurts her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing her driving test, just like she had healed when moving from Vietnam to the United States, she can re - visit the test, without the pain of past failure clouding her mind.
744	9608	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows the character, Saeng, was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “It's flowers aren’t as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,” I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng. It's almost as if she's saying that the move here has left some emotional scars on Saeng, but she will be strong and survive the change. Just like anyone who has failed a test, she will study more intently and try harder to pass it next time. Saeng isn't going to give up easily and she'll keep holding on firmly to make it through. Saeng knows it's hard to adjust to the changes in life, but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a manageable challenge. If she believes in herself whole - heartedly, she'll be able to get situated in this new place and build a fulfilling life.
745	9609	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. In the spring, when the thick snow melts away and the geese return from their migration, and this winter hibiscus is starting to bud, then I will take that test again. There are many reasons for this vow. One is that when winter comes and brings all the heavy snow, it destroys her garden. So that's why she wants it to be spring again, so she can start growing things anew in her garden. She has to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is safe for someone to eat it. That's why I think the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” is so significant. It represents Saeng's hope for a new start and her determination to overcome the setbacks of winter and prove herself through the test once the favorable season arrives.
746	9610	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the gentle snow melts and the geese gracefully return and this beautiful hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the young girl is gradually adapting to her new country and sincerely hopes to do better in the spring. The reason the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it clearly shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is firmly determined to get stronger as time goes on. She is saying when the hibiscus returns in all its splendor, she will be fully ready to take the test again and not fail it, which reflects her growth and resilience.
747	9611	4	3	The Hibiscus is budding means that the delicate flower was steadily growing. That is a flower with lots of vivid and bright colors that can light up any space, and nothing else can beat it in terms of its charm. The reason another flower can’t beat it is because that flower represents so many wonderful things, such as hope and beauty, and it is one of the most naturally - born and exquisite flowers around, a true marvel of nature.
748	9612	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was precisely how he wanted the story to end. He deliberately wanted to end the story with her quietly talking to herself, creating an intimate and thought - provoking moment that leaves a lasting impression on the readers, allowing them to feel the character's innermost thoughts and emotions.
749	9613	4	3	People have to adapt to different cultures if they move to a new place. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends in the local community and gradually adjusting to the unique features of the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still fondly remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, “Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2. She has various precious remembrances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She carefully buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and lovingly plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the soft snow melts and the geese return in formation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s strong desire to fit in with this new culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph effectively summarizes Saeng’s complex emotion for her old country as well as her unwavering determination to succeed here.
750	9614	4	3	Because she was earnestly promising herself that when the warm spring comes back with its pleasant breeze and blooming nature, then she will bravely take the driver's test again. This self - promise shows her determination to overcome the previous setback and move forward in her new life.
751	9615	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to vividly show her unwavering determination. When she says, “...when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Saeng is clearly explaining how the geese have the strong determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the firm determination to bud again. So, she wonders why she shouldn't have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, “I - I failed the test.” It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she witnessed the geese's and hibiscus's determination through harsh conditions, she became firmly determined to try the test again, believing that she could overcome this setback.
752	9616	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to clearly explain how she already took the test and it is now winter. She plans to retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start anew. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it successfully. She bought a plant called dorl Faeng - noi for nineteen dollars, hoping to help her mother not be disappointed. However, mother was disappointed that she spent that much money on a plant, but Saeng still held onto her hope of passing the test to prove herself.
753	9617	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that when she sees the things from her home and living environment, it will greatly comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that can help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of her earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job, it helps to think of the good things that mean a lot to me so that I will be happy and eager to do well. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again, it will be like a sign of good luck for her, giving her the confidence to face the test.
754	9618	4	3	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver’s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel a great deal of loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Through the rest of the story, Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,”, “The winter hibiscus was in the ground now”, and, “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and – yes – familiar to Saeng now.” This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to a new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new home that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng’s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to truly thrive in it, making a new and fulfilling life for herself.
755	9619	4	3	The author concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says “...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again” (Ho @NUM1). This clearly shows that even though she failed it this time, when the hibiscus gets bigger, she will retake the test. It represents her ability to overcome obstacles. Also, I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it “gives her strength from her old country”. This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test. It will do this by giving her strength or comforting her. From this, you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement to emphasize the power of the hibiscus as a symbol of her ability to face and overcome challenges in her new life.
756	9620	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly indicates that Saeng is confident and is genuinely willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about herself, having found the inner strength and motivation, and whole - heartedly wants to do this to prove herself.
757	9621	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a crucial test. In the story, there are some specific quotes to support my response. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng said. This clearly shows that she was taking a test about gardening, a subject that was very important in their life. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was centered around spring, gardening, and the significance of life to them. The paragraph vividly talks about spring, and the beautiful flowers that bloom. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by carefully planting vegetables, and delicious fruits, making gardening a way of life for them.
758	9622	4	3	The last paragraph of the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is extremely important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite and clear - cut ending so the reader knows exactly what is going to happen in the future. This paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represents powerful symbols in the story. The author concludes that the hibiscus is of great importance to her. Along with the hibiscus, it also shows that the geese flying and the slow melting of the snow represent a fresh start and a brand - new beginning. These symbols are important to her in that they give her a well - deserved chance to start over, and she clearly sees that hope in the winter hibiscus, making it a powerful and meaningful conclusion.
759	9623	4	3	Saeng was very distraught knowing that she didn't pass the test. To her, it felt as though it was a huge let - down or a deep disappointment. This setback, however, only made her more determined. This sentence shows the strong ambition and unwavering determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test and achieve her goals.
760	9624	4	3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back …” to show how Saeng has changed significantly throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning, she refers to her new home as “walking into another world.” As a teenager, she had to move from Vietnam, where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant serves as a strong connection between her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was extremely hard for her to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the “familiar fragrance” which “filled her lungs.” It was even difficult for Saeng to say the words “at home” without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground, it gradually changed Saeng and she finally realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it clearly showed how much the plant resembled Saeng and how her mindset on life was completely altered.
761	9625	4	3	I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of subtly showing how Saeng is gradually adopting to her new home, yet still deeply valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is quite clear: Saeng will take her test again in the spring, which vividly shows her remarkable perseverance. However, the sentence also interestingly shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says, “when the snows melt and the geese return”; this is important because the geese and the snow are characteristic elements of her now home, and she now whole - heartedly accepts them. However, Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,” and this clearly shows how Saeng is still constantly thinking of her old home, because the plant is her precious connection to the cherished memories of Vietnam. Therefore, I feel that the author is effectively showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this meaningful statement.
762	9626	4	3	I think that the author is trying to convey today is that when it is winter, the hibiscus is bravely trying to withstand the cold. While most plants simply wither and die at the onset of winter, the hibiscus must face the harsh cold head - on, showing its tenacious nature. This resilience of the hibiscus may be a symbol of something deeper, perhaps representing a similar spirit in the face of adversity.
763	9627	4	3	I think the author includes this because she doesn't want to leave her audience in a state of uncertainty, guessing about what would happen next. Then “I will take the test again.” This quote clearly indicates that she might have failed the test related to the plant, but she is resolute and will never give up. She firmly believes that when spring comes, she is going to try again with renewed determination. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland and come to a place you don't know or understand, such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt, it brought back the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so accustomed to plants being free and growing in the open rather than seeing them confined in pots and not having the space to grow. By seeing all this, it got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion, I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for better understanding and also to let you know that Saeng may be in a new place with a new culture, but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it successfully.
764	9628	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly, the story is much better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This statement holds great significance. When the author writes about all those things in nature that will happen, it powerfully symbolizes re - birth and a fresh start, a brand - new chance, and that is precisely what Saeng needs with her drivers license test. The author put it very powerfully, incorporating those symbols to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a strong sense of roundness and comes to a satisfying end with that last paragraph, making the story feel complete and well - crafted.
765	9629	4	3	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it is a good learning story from which you can learn something valuable. The author did that so you can get a more in - depth understanding of the story. It said “Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam.” So from reading that, it clearly tells me that it is informing you what happened right before the story took place. This way, you can get a better grasp of the context. To me, it is neatly wrapping it all up for you. That's why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph, providing a clear and comprehensive ending to the narrative.
766	9630	4	3	I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story like she did because Saeng, having failed the test initially, agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words, when the vibrant season of spring has come, she will be ready to face the test with renewed determination. Saeng states in the story “it’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I think Saeng is using this resilient plant as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam, a place far different from her current environment. She plans to persevere and make it, using the plant as a powerful symbol of hope and strength. She will try again for her driver's license at the start of spring, aiming to overcome this challenge.
767	9631	4	3	"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because it is resembling that her mother, much like nature in spring, is refreshing, waking, and restoring itself. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that rejuvenating time arrives. She was really sad she failed the test. “I – I failed the test,” she uttered, and her tone clearly showed that she seemed to be a mix of embarrassment and deep sadness. So that last paragraph in the story does a good job of describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore herself, gathering the courage and skills to come back and pass the test, just as nature recovers from the cold of winter."
768	9632	4	3	I, the narrator, appreciate this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valuable plant, and having a garden is your own personal decision. Just like her mother, who has a penchant for growing hot peppers, you can choose what to cultivate. A garden is a way to experience diversity, like the different types of foods you can plant and the various plants in the world. There are, for example, roses, lilies, and other plants like that. Each plant in the garden adds its own unique touch, whether it's the color, the smell, or the taste. It's a small world of nature that you can create and nurture, making the garden a special and meaningful place.
769	9633	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver's test was a significant setback for Saeng, but she is not one to give up easily. So she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus, with its harsh conditions, is like overcoming an obstacle. Just as the hibiscus endures the cold and emerges stronger, Saeng will face her challenges head - on. She will draw inspiration from the plant's resilience and work hard to pass the test on her next attempt, showing that setbacks are just temporary and can be overcome with determination.
770	9634	4	3	Why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it's showing how much passing the driving test actually means to her. It's not just about getting a license; it represents a step towards independence and achievement. By showing that she cares deeply about this goal, Saeng demonstrates her commitment and determination. And because she cares so much, she will take the test again. She won't let a single failure stop her from reaching her objective. This conclusion emphasizes her strong will and the importance of perseverance in the face of difficulties.
771	9635	4	3	She ends the story with that paragraph because she sincerely wants to let everyone know that she feels most at ease and comfortable in the spring. It also clearly states that she can hardly wait for the geese to return and the hibiscus to start budding as it is truly her favorite time of the year, a time filled with new beginnings and fresh hope.
772	9636	4	3	Saeng is not comfortable in her surroundings as the place is so different from where she used to live, and she has not fully adapted to the changes from the place she moved. She spots the hibiscus and decides to go buy it, because it vividly reminds her of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home, her mother seems shocked at first by the relatively high price Saeng had paid, but is then more understanding and sympathetic when she realizes Saeng misses @LOCATION2. Saeng says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also subtly implying that she is going to change her negative attitude about living in @LOCATION1 and try to embrace the new environment.
773	9637	4	3	I think the author concludes that in the story because he is specifically saying that when the geese are coming back, it symbolizes the arrival of a new and promising season, which might bring positive changes and new opportunities in the story.
774	9638	4	3	The author concludes that because she wants to vividly show that Saeng was not giving up easily. I say this because she moved to a completely unfamiliar place where she didn't like the environment and knew no one. The author is trying to tell us that no matter what difficulties we face, we shouldn't give up and should always have faith. At the end, Saeng has strong faith in herself that she can pass the test next time. By @MONTH1, she might have realized that just because you're in a place you don't want to be, it doesn't mean you can't move forward and make the best of the situation.
775	9639	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to effectively give the reader the clear idea that you can't just quit if you fail. When Saeng firmly said that when spring comes around she will return and take the test again, that strongly shows that she will not give up easily and that life will surely go on with new hopes and possibilities. That's precisely why I think the author chose to conclude the story in such a meaningful way.
776	9640	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that particular plant, it vividly brought back warm memories of her old home and it clearly showed how much she deeply missed it there. By firmly saying she'll do the test again, it shows that she doesn't want to let this feeling of homesickness defeat her in her new home and her new life. This determination in the face of homesickness is a powerful message within the story.
777	9641	4	3	The author concludes Saeng's vow in the story to effectively show that Saeng can and does have the real ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng genuinely feels like she is a failure due to her recent setbacks. Her hibiscus beautifully represents courage to overcome her significant obstacle which is her driving test that she unfortunately failed. The geese symbolically represent survival and the spirit to never give up, encouraging her to keep trying her hardest to achieve success. This combination of symbols emphasizes Saeng's potential for growth.
778	9642	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost exactly like the flower itself. Just as the flower will surely blossom in its own time, Saeng will bravely take the test again. Both are set to receive a fresh start on things, a new beginning full of hope. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positively uplifted. It was a short ending but one with a profound and deep - seated meaning. “...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is truly inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh, just as Saeng plans to do. This ending leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
779	9643	4	3	The author ends the story with “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” for many good and valid reasons. Some reasons are, that she will steadily keep moving on and gradually adapt to her new life in Canada. She is going to make changes to her way of life and sincerely try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the painful memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” She wants to be able to handle the loss more gracefully. The author wants to strongly emphasize that the story is not yet over and there is still more growth and change to come for Saeng.
780	9644	4	3	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason is that it's the start of the cold winter season, so the hibiscus won't return until the warm spring arrives. Also, it's the end of the story, so it's a very good way to end it because it aligns with the natural cycle of the hibiscus and the ending of the narrative. The last paragraph also neatly summarizes up the story and it's short and sweet. Which makes it a truly great ending to the story. It's not like most endings to a story, so it's delightfully unique. Because most stories aren't about nature and its connection to the characters' lives. In conclusion, there are many well - thought - out reasons the narrator could have chosen to end the story with this paragraph.
781	9645	4	3	"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with vivid memories of the past and begins to weep. Her mother's kindness causes Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" Realizing that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test, ready to face the challenge with newfound resolve."
782	9646	4	3	The author ends with this response because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat her actions but this time be more helpful in the garden for her mother. She will try harder with her school work and focus less on gardening, aiming to strike a better balance in her life and make progress in both areas.
783	9647	4	3	Saeng's personality in this story shows determination and confidence. I think she feels that she could handle more experienced tasks on different plants. I also think this is a perfect hobby experience for someone who loves plants. I feel that by @MONTH1, Saeng may have accomplished her goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 might want to pursue her career in gardening. When she stated that when the plants come back around, she would take the test again. I think she means that she is willing to explore more plants. I think she @MONTH1 may have got this experience of planting from her mother. To me, this @MONTH1 may have been a family tradition. Saeng will probably have kids and teach them about different types of flowers, continuing this cherished family legacy.
784	9648	4	3	"The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward to her life with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story's plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plants it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, ""when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" It clearly shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that effectively helps express the story's themes, leaving a lasting impression on the reader."
785	9649	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" because Saeng wants to act in proper time and season. During the ""winter season"", the land or soil was so cold that plants were not able to grow properly. ""Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars"", and she Saeng failed the test. ""There was a frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply."" Her mother shines when she works on the plants. These all are the descriptions that conclude events in the past which Saeng wants to correct and shine like her mother and also to pass the test, setting a new course for herself."
786	9650	4	3	At the end of the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng says, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” When she says this, she is referring to her driver's test. She says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didn't give up. They moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start. “A plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world.” She sees these flowers after failing the test, which reminds her that she has never given up before. So, she won't give up now either. The flowers symbolize resilience and the hope of a new beginning, just as she hopes to pass the test and start afresh.
787	9651	4	3	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reassures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye out of feelings of disappointment and guilt. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother as a way to express her unspoken emotions and her determination to do better. The ending reassures the reader so that you don't wonder how it will work out for Saeng. It gives the impression that despite the setback, there is still a positive future ahead for her.
788	9652	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be coming back again, it will survive even though it's not from where she originally wanted it to be from. In the story, it says, “I failed the test,” meaning Saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn't real or what she thought it was not what she wanted it to be. This disappointment with the flower mirrors her disappointment with failing the test. In the last paragraph, she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find the winter hibiscus that is how it used to be in the homeland. She's hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says, “Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland, and with that renewed hope, she will succeed in the test.
789	9653	4	3	The author was trying to end the story quickly, which is why he ended it with this one. By choosing this particular ending, the author likely aimed to leave a concise and impactful impression on the reader. Perhaps the story had reached a point where a quick conclusion was fitting to maintain the overall tone and message. It might also have been a way to avoid over - elaborating and to let the reader draw their own conclusions based on the events leading up to the end. In this way, the abruptness of the ending can be seen as a deliberate literary choice.
790	9654	4	3	When spring comes and all the snow melts, then she is going to plant new seeds. The author concludes that because she didn't do well on the test the first time. But next year, she is going to work with her plants, nurturing them with care and patience. This process of working with the plants will not only be a way to connect with nature but also a means of building her confidence and determination. Then she will take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he doesn't want people to think that she just worries about the plants. Instead, the plants are a symbol of her growth and her ability to overcome challenges, just as she hopes to overcome the hurdle of passing the test.
791	9655	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", it revolves around a girl named Saeng, along with her mother and grandmother. Flowers hold great beauty in their eyes, and they spend the whole day planting them. They are also engaged in activities like picking them and arranging them. As the text mentions, “Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye”. This shows a certain tension or unease in their relationship at that moment."
792	9656	4	3	The author concludes the story with the saying because it clearly shows that the protagonist has confidence in herself. Despite not passing the test, she realizes that she can take it again and knows deep down that she can pass it. Initially, she was quite upset about the test result. However, when her mother talked to her, her mother's kind words made her feel good and confident enough to retake the test. She firmly believes she can pass this time. That's precisely why I think the author concludes the story with that saying at the end, as it perfectly captures the character's growth in confidence.
793	9657	4	3	This paragraph means that when winter finally comes to an end and the geese return from the south, and her favorite plant that used to be in her old country makes its reappearance, she will once again attempt what she was trying to do before. This time, she has more self - assurance. She believes that with the change of season and the return of familiar elements, she can face the challenge with a newfound determination. This is what I think this paragraph truly means.
794	9658	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively sums everything up and resolves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said, “… I will take that test again”, it clearly demonstrated that she is determined to pass the test and is willing to try once more. Since the conflict has been successfully solved at this point, to keep the story going, one would typically have to introduce a new conflict. However, the author decides to end it here. This excerpt from the last paragraph also draws a parallel between Saeng's difficulty in getting her driver's license and the hardships that geese face. Just as geese encounter challenges during their journey, Saeng has faced hardships in obtaining her license. But like the geese, she is ready to go back and face those hardships again with courage.
795	9659	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in a well - mannered and carefully crafted way. The author chose to end with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to give up, even though she was far away from home. At the beginning of the story, she was in a downward spiral. She had failed a test, and the sight of the hibiscus made her feel nostalgic. When she got home, her mother greeted her with kind words, acting almost like an anti - depressant. Her mother made food without peppers and bitter melons, which was a small but significant gesture. This kind of loving act made Saeng see the good in life, causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test in the future.
796	9660	4	3	Well in the story, Saeng fails her driving test. When she is walking home dejectedly, she sees a familiar plant by the roadside. Intrigued, she then goes to a florist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it vividly reminds her of her homeland and the carefree days of her childhood. It also reminds her of her beloved grandmother who she left behind so now she feels deeply connected to the plant. Also, as she stands there with the plant in her hand, she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter. So she says “When they come back,” so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when “the snow melts,” so when it becomes warmer and the beautiful season of spring starts. When “this hibiscus is budding,” so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will “take that test again.” So she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice diligently and get ready for the test. She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass.
797	9661	4	3	She said this to show the determination it takes to make it in life. No matter how many times you fail, you need to gather your strength and get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this very way. It takes a great deal of inner strength for someone to face failure and then have the resolve to get back up and try again on the same thing. She isn't willing to simply accept failure as her fate. Instead, she's trying to redeem her failure, so she firmly says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way, leaving a powerful message of perseverance.
798	9662	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will have a clear idea of what she is going to do next spring. They might even be inspired to create another story in their minds. By ending the story this way, the readers will know that she will take the test in the spring, which gives a sense of anticipation and closure to the narrative. It allows the readers to envision her future steps and feel more connected to the character's journey.
799	9663	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with that paragraph because when the cold winter hits, the plant she likes will gradually disappear. The flower gave her good luck, so she said “when the snow melts in the spring and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The flower was very important to her. She said, “that rich, sweet scent that was familiar too.” She was talking about how the flower's smell compares to her grandmother's shell; it was the same comforting and nostalgic aroma that brought back warm memories. This connection to the flower and the promise related to it make the ending of the story meaningful.
800	9664	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the same thing next year. It seems that whatever action or event was described in the story is part of a recurring cycle for her. By ending the story in this way, the author suggests that there is a continuity to her experiences. It leaves the readers with the thought that the character's journey will continue, and they can look forward to what might happen in the next iteration of this annual event. It gives a sense of the character's perseverance and the ongoing nature of her life's path.
801	9665	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because she wants to retake the test. She deeply desires to prove herself and improve her result. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother, who has always supported and believed in her. So she carefully selected and brought home the flower to sincerely apologize to her mother for her previous failure.
802	9666	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat, just like the regular cycle of season changes. You will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter, as it is a harsh and unforgiving time. For example, she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, with its familiar landscapes and climates. But she has to adapt to the fact she’s not home, and adjust to her new and somewhat alien environment. I say this because if she doesn't, she will just be an unhappy person constantly worrying about where she came from, unable to move forward in her new life.
803	9667	4	3	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. This is because I think she feels a glimmer of hope and unwavering faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and depressed, as the new place lacks the warmth and familiarity of her old home. She is nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home again. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring, marking a new beginning in her life.
804	9668	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. In the spring, when the snow gradually melts and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is gently budding, then I will take that test again, determined to achieve a better outcome.
805	9669	4	3	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author chose the last paragraph because it perfectly matched the tone, the hope, and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depressed and full - of - sorrow mood because she failed the driver's test so she is very upset. Her memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like vivid flashbacks. The winter starts to give her the feeling that all hope is lost. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her, the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year, with no new hope, no new anything, just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purely from the representation. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the word at home, lest she burst into tears again.” She can't say home because home isn't hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of immense emotions all having to do with her past. So the last paragraph is more about how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so that's why it fits when it does, making the conclusion a perfect wrap - up for the story.
806	9670	4	3	This was a truly captivating story that vividly showed all the hardships this young girl has endured. The author concluded it in a highly engaging way. When the story ended, I couldn't help but think about how beautifully it wrapped up. I firmly believe the author did an excellent job. She managed to depict all the struggles that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the frigid winter. Then, as the author stated, “as the snow melts away; …”, I think this vividly shows that even though Saeng's problems seem endless and harsh, one day they will disappear, and things will turn beautiful again, just like a flower budding in the springtime. Moreover, she did a great job because throughout the story, I could deeply feel her pain. I felt as if I was right there with her due to her use of descriptive words like “exploding, shock, intense” and others to describe how sudden everything was. Then, when she ended it, it was as if she was showing us Saeng's hope for a better future, even though things aren't the way they were back home! The author's skillful storytelling truly made this a memorable experience.
807	9671	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph - “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is because she deeply feels that when the hibiscus blooms, she too can bloom by successfully passing the test. Also, Saeng is closely relating herself to the hibiscus. “Its flower isn't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through in here, this winter hibiscus.” Her mother is gently trying to tell her that she can be strong as well. She too can persevere through the cold and difficult months. “Like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” Just like the geese, Saeng is gradually realizing to be proud of herself and understand that there will be other chances. One shouldn't always doubt themselves because there will be other opportunities. One shouldn't be afraid to try again and keep moving forward.
808	9672	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will return after winter to carefully take care of it. The author strategically places this in the ending paragraph because he is clearly showing how much she cares about this plant as she takes meticulous care of it since it vividly reminds her of her hometown. So, that is the definite reason she takes such good and attentive care of it so that she will always have something with her to fondly remind her of her home. This connection to the plant adds a poignant touch to the story's conclusion.
809	9674	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it clearly shows how Saeng, just like the geese, will successfully adapt to her new environment. It demonstrates that she will do whatever is necessary in order to survive, much like the geese have to do. She will bravely take the test again and will not easily give up. The paragraph shows how she sincerely wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, “… she noticed the tear - stains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes” [No]. This example clearly shows how Saeng is not yet accustomed to being in the new country and that she does not like it at present. However, she will gradually get used to it and do her very best to do so, as clearly shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, “… she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac” [Ho]. This proves how even though she might not like things at times, Saeng is willing to bravely try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, “… she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now”. Saeng is steadily getting more and more used to her surroundings and is adapting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the exact reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.
810	9675	4	3	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to clearly show that Saeng is eagerly looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is earnestly hoping to see the geese once more that bring back fond memories of her homeland and that she wants to successfully pass the driving test. In this story, I truly feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person. She holds on to the memories associated with the geese and her homeland tightly. That is why I firmly think that is the reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph. It not only gives a sense of hope for Saeng but also a glimpse into her emotional depth and longing for a better life.
811	9676	4	3	He concludes this paragraph in the story because it has a pleasant and harmonious sound, and it aims to show the readers that no matter what hardships or setbacks you encounter in life, you should just keep on doing what you think is best for you. Just like the flower that perseveres, it keeps coming back for more after going through all that tough and challenging situation. This is a powerful message that encourages us to stay true to ourselves and our paths.
812	9677	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a specific reason. The hibiscus, with its vibrant colors and unique appearance, reminds her vividly of Vietnam, a place filled with memories and emotions. The geese, flying in formation across the sky, remind her of her current home, a place where she has found a new sense of belonging. These two things, the hibiscus and the geese, serve as sources of strength and inspiration for her. Therefore, she will take the test when they return, confident in her abilities. She firmly believes that she can pass the test when the flower and the geese are present in her life, as they symbolize hope and resilience.
813	9678	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng is starting to take responsibility for her school work now. Previously, in the story, she made it very obvious that she cared more about the garden, spending a lot of time nurturing the plants and enjoying the beauty of nature, than about her school tasks. However, this change in her attitude indicates a positive development in her character, suggesting that she is maturing and understanding the importance of balancing her interests and responsibilities.
814	9679	4	3	Saeng was talking about testing the plants, carefully observing to see if the geese liked where she had planted them. I know this because she specifically mentioned geese in the last paragraph, and it was described that the geese seemed to give an affirmative response, as if they said “yes,” when she planted the hibiscus. This interaction between Saeng, the plants, and the geese shows her thoughtfulness and her connection with nature, and it also implies that she is making decisions based on the well - being of the environment around her.
815	9680	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly centered around the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it’s spring and this beautiful hibiscus is budding, with its delicate petals starting to unfurl, then she will take the test again. The hibiscus, with its rich cultural and emotional significance, reminded her of her homeland in the past, a place full of warmth, traditions, and cherished memories. This connection to her roots gives her the courage and motivation to face the test once more.
816	9681	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because at the end, the text is talking of a new beginning. This new start is significant as it shows a shift in the character's situation. Also, what it’s going to be at the new beginning is clear when she says that she is going to take the test again, indicating a fresh attempt and a chance for improvement.
817	9682	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind as she found a flower that vividly reminds her of her homeland. This connection to her roots gives her a sense of comfort. She is afraid that her parents are going to be mad at her for not passing the test, so, as a way to ease her guilt, she buys a flower that she sees and which serves as a reminder of home. When she gets home and tells her mom how much she paid for the flower and how she didn’t pass, her mother is upset for only a second. Then, she shows understanding of what her daughter is going through. By the end of the story, she has more confidence that she will succeed next time, as the support from her mother has bolstered her spirit.
818	9683	4	3	"Minfong Ho ended the story with a phrase dialogue because it was directly about the main topic of the story. Saeng was tasked to buy a plant and bring it home. However, when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously"" (Ho). When her mother said this, it clearly showed that she was displeased with Saeng's action. The narrative also states, ""I - I failed the test"" (Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way, as she held their approval in high regard. By saying, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and her strong desire to grow for her parents; it shows her growing maturity as she takes responsibility for her failure and plans for a better future."
819	9684	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to convey this because since she failed the test, she now knows what she did wrong and she is going to correct those mistakes. For example, when Saeng said, “then I will take that test again,” it reveals her determination. Saeng feels sorry that she failed a simple test, so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts, seeing this time as a fresh start and an opportunity to prove herself.
820	9685	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant wasn't budding and the geese were going away, and on top of that, she failed the test. All these factors combined made her sad. The lack of a budding plant symbolized her current lack of progress, and the departing geese added to the sense of loss. But when the snow melts, the geese return, and the plant starts budding, she will be happy again. This change in the environment represents a new beginning and a positive shift in her emotional state. She will take the test again and she will pass because she is happy, as a positive mindset will likely lead to better performance.
821	9686	4	3	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to vividly show that Saeng is not going to give up and will keep trying her best to pass her test. Another aspect is to demonstrate that even though your life has undergone changes, that doesn't mean that you have to give up your goals. These are some of the ways that the author concludes the story like he does, effectively conveying important messages through the narrative.
822	9687	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they specifically wanted to show that she is deeply committed to her nature, especially to the hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was truly special because of the intimate actions she did with it. Like when they said “she reached out and gently touched a petal. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the centre”. This tactile description emphasizes her connection. And that’s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph, to highlight this profound bond.
823	9688	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels that the moment when the hibiscus is budding will be the right time to retake her driving test. She believes this time will bring positive energy and a fresh start. And another reason would be because the author wants to clearly show her unwavering determination to achieve success in the test. This conclusion effectively portrays Saeng's mindset and the author's intention.
824	9689	4	3	She vowed this paragraph because she earnestly wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had unfortunately failed it. But she patiently waits for the plant to go through its growth cycle and start budding. The hibiscus bud is like a symbol of a new start. If it can make it through the harsh winter, it gives her hope that just as the tropical plant was able to survive a difficult season, she can also survive and pass the test the next spring, fulfilling her vow.
825	9690	4	3	Why I think the author concludes the last paragraph in the story is because it's kind of like a clear moral to the story. She's trying to say that when the time is right, she will bravely try it again and again until she gets it right. Without this last paragraph, you wouldn't be able to fully understand the inspiring message of the story, which is about perseverance and waiting for the opportune moment.
826	9691	4	3	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom as she frequently makes things for her. The author crafted that ending sentence to make the story more interesting for the readers and to keep them hooked until the end.
827	9692	4	3	The author concludes the story with that sentence because she wanted to clearly explain to you that she will repeat this action again when the hibiscus is back in its blooming season.
828	9693	4	3	I guess she says this because she only feels comfortable taking the test when she is surrounded by the beautiful flowers, lush plants, and vibrant greens.
829	9694	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it specifically mentions that when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. This means that when she grows older and gains more confidence, she will blossom and be able to take the test when she is truly ready, just like the hibiscus will be ready to start budding again.
830	9695	4	3	The author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature, there are distinct seasons. For example, in winter, the flowers don't bloom. The paragraph is saying that in the spring, when the winter is over, she tells herself that she will eagerly look forward to seeing all the plants that nature has to offer.
831	9696	4	3	I believe he deliberately used this as the ending to firmly ensure that she was not only physically but also mentally strong, and she would whole - heartedly do whatever it took to persevere through all the challenges that came her way.
832	9697	4	3	The author includes this specific sentence in the particular paragraph because it clearly marks the start of a brand - new beginning, setting the tone for what is to follow.
833	9698	4	3	In the story, the author concludes with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she did that to strongly say that you shouldn't give up easily. In the story, Saeng goes to the store and gently “touched a petal” of the hibiscus plant. She carefully buys the plant in an attempt to get a vivid reminder of her old home. In this way, it seems Saeng is reluctantly willing to give up some of her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant, her mom helps her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is earnestly trying to make her new home feel as cozy and familiar as her old one.
834	9699	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return gracefully, the snow melts slowly, and the hibiscus is budding beautifully. This is done to clearly symbolize the many valuable things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt that she has to actively adjust to the changes in her life and become well - acquainted with the new things around her. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were “strange before [and] had become familiar to her now”. The hibiscus also represents something meaningful and has a valid reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to bravely overcome obstacles, the strong connection to the past, and the much - needed comfort when she feels lost. The last paragraph symbolizes many profound things, and if you look into it deeply, you will truly learn what Saeng learnt.
835	9700	4	3	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself about the relationship between passing the driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is closely linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was known as “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower can smoothly adapt to its new surrounding when taken from a different country, just as Saeng is adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again clearly symbolizes the connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, it shows her ability and determination that when that flower buds, she will courageously overcome obstacles. Another aspect is the connection to her past experiences. And it was a great sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author skillfully linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story, showing the hope and unwavering dedication of Saeng and the obstacles she has passed to reach where she is today.
836	9701	4	3	The reason why I believe the author concluded the story like that is because she is always going to start over. For instance, in the story, she said, “I failed the test.” From that moment, she thought she was going to give up. However, her resilient nature implies she won't stay down. So, that is why I believe the author ended the story with that line, suggesting a fresh start ahead.
837	9702	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to convey that Saeng is going to start all over again, much like the hibiscus would rejuvenate itself. Even though one may go through bad times in life, one should simply step back and do it over again until the situation becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph essentially restarts the narrative, mirroring what Saeng was about to do. This shows the cyclical nature of life and Saeng's determination to move forward.
838	9703	4	3	She means that when she returns, she is going to repeat the same thing once more and see if she will perform better or not. This indicates her willingness to learn from past experiences and improve herself. By giving it another try, she hopes to achieve a more favorable outcome.
839	9704	4	3	"Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because her mind wandered off the track from thinking about a flower. She says, ""One of the blossoms had fallen off,"" then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. This action distracted her mind. Her reaction to failing was to be silent for a long moment and not say a word. She never got mad. All her mother did was brush the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly preoccupied with the plants as the day went on. Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus' into it. Seeing her mother's actions sparked a reaction of ideas, so she tried to etch an image of geese in her mind. She decided to retake the driving test again as she was getting used to her new environment. The intro says ""Saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam,"" yet it never elaborates on her family. This lack of detail leaves room for speculation about their role in her journey."
840	9705	4	3	The author included this paragraph to vividly show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus, it instantly brought back a flood of memories of Vietnam. The sight of the hibiscus provided her with a sense of comfort in a foreign land. So, the paragraph serves to highlight how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons, it allows the girl to gradually get used to her new home. The plant will always be there as a reminder, but she has to look for the positive aspects that the United States offers. The author states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote clearly shows how the girl was adapting to the United States. It also shows that while she will always remember Vietnam, she can find elements in the United States that remind her of home. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she is gradually finding comfort and a sense of belonging within the United States.
841	9706	4	3	These basically say that he will be around again, just like how geese always return season - after - season, making their predictable journey back to the familiar places.
842	9707	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfortable about talking about her old home, as shown by “She was still too shy to say the words ‘at home’” [HO]. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding are all elements that remind her of her home. We know this because Saeng says “Just as she had known it would feel… Back home it just grew wild, just out from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs” [HO]. So, with these reminders of her home, she is given both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concluded with this paragraph because since the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of her home, that is when she will take the test again, when she is confident and strong, ready to face the challenge anew.
843	9708	4	3	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it shows that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was extremely miserable and heart - broken. However, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation. In the end, she decides that she will take the test again, “in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. It helps move the story to a satisfying conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to obtain the message from the story through paragraphs like this. In this case, the author’s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what an author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs, not only as a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience, so that the intended message is effectively conveyed.
844	9709	4	3	I think that the author uses this quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 It symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. “But where did the home thought come from? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?”, “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. One night she had so much hope, an abundance of it, then the next she is in a foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will bloom, and birds will return. It is a chance to let go of the past hardships. The ending quote was said to bring hope and light to her, and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle easier to get over and everything more bearable, allowing her to face the future with courage.
845	9710	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the springtime, the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place, she was small and puny, just like the plant. “Its leaves quavering in the wind” (@NUM1). This quote tells us that the plant was weak and puny. If the plant was strong, it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng broke down and bought the plant tells us she was not strong at that time. And at the end, the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that just as the hibiscus has the potential to grow strong, so is Saeng, and she can overcome anything, emerging from her period of weakness into a state of strength and resilience.
846	9711	4	3	The author concludes the story in this manner to vividly show that Saeng does not give up easily and is firmly determined to pass the test. The narration clearly states, “Not like the kind we had @NUM1].” This indicates that Saeng has a deep - seated connection to her old home. She feels very strongly about her old home and yearns for hibiscus just like the ones she and her grandmother used to have. Since Saeng was unable to bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is both sad and determined to obtain another one. The text also specifically states, “... and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2].” This further demonstrates her determination because even though she failed the test once, she is ready to try again. She misses her home so much and desires hibiscus just like she had at her old home, which drives her forward.
847	9712	4	3	In this story, the reason that the author concludes things in this particular way is to pick a tone that makes the character feel comfortable to take the test again. The person who will take the test again might have chosen the tone in relation to her past experiences. She takes the time to carefully prepare herself, and perhaps this is a practice that her parents or grandparents taught her. This way of concluding the story implies that the character is drawing strength from her heritage and past lessons to face the test anew.
848	9713	4	3	The author concluded this part of the story because she believes that this is the right time for Saeng to retake the test. She adds these details as the snow has melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese have returned. This is a perfect time because everything in nature is back to life and the weather is warm. When she says, “when they come back...then I will take the test again,” it clearly means that Saeng will have all the confidence she needs to take the test. Saeng has vowed to take it again, and she is determined to do so. She thinks that this time she will pass the test. That is precisely what the author concludes with in the story, emphasizing Saeng's hope and determination.
849	9714	4	3	The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly show the hope and the profound meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story in this way because spring is a well - known time for new beginnings. Everything in nature comes back to life and starts to regrow. When it is said that when the snow melts and geese return, it's like saying it's the right time for a second chance. Saeng failed the test as she said, “She tore off a leaf, shredded it to pests.” This action shows the dying of the hope she once had, or perhaps the hibiscus symbolized that hope. So, that's why the author ended it like this because it shows new beginnings and the cycle of hope and renewal.
850	9715	4	3	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with a strong paragraph consisting of one sentence stating that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This simple yet powerful sentence leaves the reader in a state of suspense. It effectively incorporates the main point of the story and combines various elements to express an idea about what might happen in a possible continuation of Saeng's future and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort both her mother and herself. While she stood there intently watching the geese, the author chose this poignant moment to express Saeng's unwavering feelings of determination to take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a strong sentence which not only summarized the key aspects of the story but also left a thrilling cliff - hanger for the readers.
851	9716	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, envisioning the upcoming spring. In the spring, when the gentle snows gradually melt, and the geese gracefully return from their long journey, and this beautiful hibiscus is budding with new life, then I will take the test again. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this makes you thoughtfully reflect about the story even after you're done reading it, leaving a lasting impression.
852	9717	4	3	In many stories, the narrator skillfully uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such impactful occurrence is in the short - story “Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, the young girl finishes off by quietly telling us when she will be taking her test again. Although not directly to us as it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”, it still effectively informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last “vow” is to inform not only the reader of the future but also to vividly show the girl's determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says “and this hibiscus is budding”, it's clearly showing the girl's connection with the plant because of the comfort and confidence it has given her, especially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion, the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to clearly show future events and to poignantly illustrate the spiritual connection the girl had with the flower and her homeland, making the story more meaningful.
853	9718	4	3	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph, the author wrote that “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the soft snows melt away and the geese return in a long - flying formation and this hibiscus is budding with promise, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a diligent student and she had unfortunately failed a test. Even though Saeng is so deeply interested in flowers, she also sincerely cares about her schoolwork too. When the snows melt, Saeng will take the test, just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossom, symbolizing new beginnings and hope.
854	9719	4	3	After they come, Saeng was sitting silently to herself, lost in thought. In the spring, when the thick snows slowly melt and the geese noisily return in groups and the hibiscus is starting to show its first signs of life, Saeng then thought to herself that I am going to take that test again. She says this sentence as she feels herself being transported back to her home. She thinks it is so familiar to how things were when Saeng was there. She is reminded of how quiet it used to be as she vowed to herself in every season. Her life here is very quiet and laid - back. She feels a sense of belonging to this place. Due to failing her driving test, she realizes that things in the United States were so different from Vietnam, and she expresses her feelings when she talks about this special flower, using it as an outlet for her emotions.
855	9720	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants to gently remind the reader and concisely summarize the story. The way she wants to summarize is by showing how the story started with Saeng disheartened after failing the test to how the story ended with Saeng tenderly planting the hibiscus in the cold winter. The author wants to effectively remind the reader about the whole story, making sure the key events and emotions stay in the reader's mind.
856	9721	4	3	He concludes this story in such a way so that you don't feel as if she was defeated. Instead, she is now more aware of the situation or firmly believes she can complete the task. Also, she has more self - confidence in herself because of the flower. Now, this flower not only reminds her of her home but also serves as a constant source of inspiration, giving her the strength to face future challenges.
857	9722	4	3	The author concluded the story with this because, just like the flower that will come back anew after a dormant period, so will she. The flower represents determination, and the author uses the flower to vividly show her own determination. Even though she failed her driver's test, she still has the unwavering determination to take it again and try to pass. Even with the failure, she is determined to get over it. Just as the flower loses its buds in the winter and grows them back in the spring, Saeng is forgetting her failure and coming back stronger, ready to embrace new beginnings.
858	9723	4	3	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization and a new beginning for Saeng. She spent so much time longing for and missing the past that she didn't know how to fully enjoy the present. Theme - wise, the author is clearly saying “live in the moment”. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said, ""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that’s what matters."" Ultimately, the author is saying that tough times are inevitable, so hold on to the precious moments that make you smile, for they will provide the support and motivation to persevere through the difficult times and emerge stronger."
859	9724	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story, Saeng vows to herself that when winter is over, she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to subtly foreshadow the future for Saeng. It seems like the author is trying to convey that Saeng will be taking some time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other important aspects of her life before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a great deal of courage to face and complete what she has once failed. The perseverance in Saeng is clearly evident and will help her overcome many challenges in her new country. In the text, when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole, she says “let me help mother.” This simple act shows her deep love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So, in the end of the story, adding the vow was a very good way to effectively show Saeng’s commitment to her goals.
860	9725	4	3	The author puts that excerpt into the text to clearly show the reader that she had made a mistake and will fix it in the future. I believe the author put it in for that reason because in the text, Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really deeply upset by the fact that she failed and sincerely hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader to believe that Saeng is going to overcome being homesick and move forward with a positive attitude in her new life.
861	9726	4	3	The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her homeland, so she thought that when the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. The plant made her think positively. Instead of thinking she will fail, she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think the hibiscus comforted her when she was upset, and that helped her feel a lot better. This shows that the hibiscus became a symbol of hope and resilience for Saeng, guiding her towards a new attempt at the test with a more optimistic outlook.
862	9727	4	3	The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reassurance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam. This paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge, just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse, she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine - toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says, “...in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The winter is a hardship for the geese as they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is the time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive, and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life, just as Saeng finds hope in the changing seasons and the resilience of nature.
863	9728	4	3	There is a reason why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It means that when she comes back after winter, she will repeat her tasks all over. For example, she will dig, send flowers to their customers. Then when winter comes again, she will do it all over. So, in essence, the author is using different words to say that when winter ends, she will repeat her actions. This cyclical pattern reflects the routine and perseverance in her life. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph, emphasizing the continuity and resilience in her daily life.
864	9729	4	3	"The author brought out the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", to portray the theme of the story. Saeng used the hibiscus for hope in her life. The author also uses the choice of words or diction to explain the way Saeng lived her life depending on a flower. The paragraph also explains how her culture is intertwined with the theme of the story, perhaps showing how nature and the changing seasons play a significant role in her values and decision - making. This connection between the hibiscus, the seasons, and her test - taking vow reveals deeper cultural and personal meanings within the story."
865	9730	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant brings back memories to Saeng, and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant as she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, just like the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow as well and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted, Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, as it beautifully draws a parallel between Saeng's personal growth and the growth of the plant, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and a clear understanding of the story's message.
866	9731	4	3	I think that the author ends this story with that specific paragraph to sum up precisely what the story was all about and to also clearly indicate that Saeng would try the test again. In the story, it explicitly says “she realised that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now”. This last paragraph effectively helps bring all these elements together, presenting a coherent conclusion to the narrative.
867	9732	4	3	A vow serves as a fitting ending. She firmly vowed to take the test again because she unfortunately failed it. This vow expresses exactly how she feels and shows that she has made a strong commitment to pass. The author intended to convey a great deal of feeling and to show just how desperate she was. So, she noticed tons of beauty around her to keep her spirits up and her determination strong. In this way, the vow encapsulates her resolve and the hope for a better outcome.
868	9733	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She buys the flower right after she failed the driver's test. She has frequently seen the familiar plant on her way home, and on this occasion, she went to a florist shop specifically to try to buy one. The flower brings her genuine happiness and vividly reminds her of home. The author ends the story this way because it leaves a glimmer of hope, ensuring that the story doesn't end on a sad note. She still holds onto the hope of passing the driver's test, and this ending reflects her resilience."
869	9734	4	3	She failed the test on the very same day that she got the plant and witnessed the geese fly over. The plant and the geese hold significant symbolic meanings for her. The plant represents her cherished home, the place where she used to live. The geese, on the other hand, could represent how they are bravely moving on in life, overcoming the difficult obstacles of cold weather and snow to move on to something better, most likely a warmer climate. All of these elements combined are a powerful symbol of a new beginning for her. So, she decided that she wanted to take the test again around the time of a new beginning, when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels that since she failed, starting over is the right path forward, and these symbols give her the motivation to do so.
870	9735	4	3	The author added the story within this paragraph for several important reasons. Firstly, it helps to make the story more substantial and engaging by adding relevant details. Secondly, it serves to show that even if you make a mistake or screw up the first time, you can still gather the courage and determination to try again. This message is an important takeaway from the story, inspiring readers to persevere in the face of failure. By including this addition, the author enriches the narrative and imparts a valuable life lesson.
871	9736	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” to emphasize that Saeng is willing to try planting again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the springtime to prove that she is earnestly trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she deeply cares about the planting, seeing it as a way to connect with her new environment.
872	9737	4	3	Saeng mentioned that she will take that test next spring and pass it with the hope inspired by her winter flower and the heart - warming sight of her flock of geese. She has high hopes that she will pass her test. When she sees the delicate buds on her hibiscus, then she will take the test again. Saeng was extremely upset when she failed it the first time and she is sincerely hoping that she will pass next spring, believing that the changing seasons will bring her good fortune.
873	9738	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng has new - found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" This shows the depth of her longing for her homeland. But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it vividly reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even carefully buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gives her warm memories of her old life and the inner strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her the courage and determination to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it clearly shows Saeng's change in emotions from deeply depressed to full of hope and it also shows the powerful strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."
874	9739	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months …, this winter hibiscus.” It shows that the mother wants Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficulty, just like the winter hibiscus. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season…” It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she’s living right now is almost the same as their old home in many ways. In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should bravely face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and gracefully follow the flow of life, just as the seasons change.
875	9740	4	3	“In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place where she has no friends, feeling quite lonely at first. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes upon a Hibiscus flower. The flower’s gentle presence calms her spirit and helps her gradually begin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time, making her look forward to the new opportunities that spring will bring.
876	9741	4	3	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time. She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start, with a renewed sense of hope and determination. In the essay, the “winter hibiscus” reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad as she misses the familiar surroundings and the warmth of home. But then she realizes how wonderful her memories are and these memories help her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her the strength to carry on with her life and try her driver’s test again in the spring, looking forward to a new beginning.
877	9742	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1, specifically the arrival of spring, comes again she will try again. The author chooses this ending as it effectively explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals. The girl mentions a lot about the geese in the story, describing their graceful flight and the way they symbolize the changing of seasons. So, from this, we know that she has a deep affection for animals. Spring represents new beginnings and hope for her, and the presence of the geese adds to this sense of renewal. By ending the story this way, the author leaves the reader with a feeling of optimism for the girl's future attempts.
878	9743	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant affect her. Just like the plant, Saeng grows better in her own country where she is surrounded by familiarity and a sense of belonging, and she likes it better there. However, she can still survive in a new place if she is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she tries harder, with more perseverance and determination, she can survive like the plant. So, she is going to take the test again, with a newfound resolve. Her mother says, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” Her mother is trying to tell the daughter it’s okay and that she can get through the hard times. In the end, Saeng is confident that she can overcome the challenges and succeed.
879	9744	4	3	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reasons for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents the ideas of resilience when faced with challenges, and the determination to adapt and succeed. Saeng’s situation is similar to the flower’s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted in a new and unfamiliar environment, and forced to try and survive the harsh Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, leaving behind her friends, family, and the life she knew. She must begin life anew in another country, and has been faced with the obstacle of failure in regards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home, using the flower as a source of inspiration and strength.
880	9745	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it clearly explains what she is going to do when winter is over. It sets a clear goal for her future and gives the reader a sense of what to expect next. Also, it keeps the readers guessing on what’s going to happen to Saeng and her mother. Will Saeng pass the test? How will their relationship develop in the new season? Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over. Spring symbolizes new beginnings, and it leaves the door open for new adventures and challenges for Saeng and her mother, creating a sense of anticipation for the future.
881	9746	4	3	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he does, and it is indeed a good reason. The story indicates that since she failed this year, next year when it is time to get the garden ready, she will try again. This is a valuable moral because one has to keep trying persistently to succeed. Even if you fail, you aren't losing any progress. It's similar to what @PERSON1 experienced. Even though it took him @DATE1 attempts to successfully make the light bulb, he simply said, “I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb.” So, I whole - heartedly agree with this author and how he ended the story as it imparts a great lesson of perseverance.
882	9747	4	3	She does this to vividly show her struggle with her gardening challenges. It is like this because each year, after the harsh winter, she has to start afresh on her garden. The winter winds blow through the garden, and the cold temperatures kill the plants, meaning she has to work hard to revive it. This cycle of destruction and renewal in her garden clearly depicts her arduous struggle.
883	9748	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows how Saeng won't give up easily. Saeng deeply wants to make her mother proud, so she is determined to do whatever it takes. All that Saeng tries to do is bring happiness to her mother. When she failed, her mother was initially disappointed, but then, surprisingly, she was understanding. When Saeng told her mother about her failure, she started to cry. However, her mother gently wiped the tears away, showing her support and love. This ending effectively showcases Saeng's tenacity and the mother - daughter bond.
884	9749	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it means that when the shovel - like plants grow again in the spring, when the snow gradually melts and the geese return from their migration, and this hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. So, she will patiently wait until the next spring to take the test, symbolizing hope and a new beginning after the long winter.
885	9750	4	3	In the story, the test was whether she could overcome her homesickness. When she went to the greenhouse, all of the plants and flowers there brought back vivid memories of her homeland. When she saw a particular flower, it reminded her of the times when she would get water from the well, and a flower was floating in it. So, after the winter passes, she would go back to that place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up. Instead, she will try again, demonstrating her strength in the face of homesickness.
886	9751	4	3	"I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a small, yet significant part about Saeng. This part would reveal what she is planning to do next. Also, the author might have added that paragraph in @MONTH1 because she was perhaps thinking about writing a second story of ""Winter Hibiscus"". They wanted to include a part that could be relevant in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, would she pass it this time? I think this is likely why the author added this paragraph in the story."
887	9752	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when Saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was deeply sad. However, after seeing the beautiful flower, her mood lifted and she got happy. Next, her mother kindly helps her plant it, and Saeng is certain it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has thoroughly reflected on her past. This new - found confidence and positive outlook are why the author chose to end the story in this way.
888	9753	4	3	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story “Winter Hibiscus” the way she did to clearly show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test, but she got the hibiscus, and this simple act helped her to restore her strong resolve to pass the test. Now that she had brief moments of her homeland and her family there, she was most likely reminded that they would've genuinely wanted her to succeed. So, she firmly promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is the reason why I feel that “Winter Hibiscus” was concluded in this way.
889	9754	4	3	At the end of the essay “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there was to vividly show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country where she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. This reminder makes her feel like she is at home, and she believes she can at least take the test. That's why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.
890	9755	4	3	Saeng promises herself that “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The hibiscus is metaphorical to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently, she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She deeply misses her homeland, and all the flowers vividly remind her of her homeland. She is so overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is indeed a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by carefully planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the driver's test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng, a flower changes also. When the hibiscus finally overcomes the cold, dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes; they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when it's warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable and ready.
891	9756	4	3	So she is saying that she will take the test next year as she feels more prepared then.
892	9757	4	3	The author concludes the story at the end because I think the author ends the story this way because he wants to kind of convey that he will be ready next year to sprout again. He will be ready to face the test and not cry and break down when he sees the plant, instead thinking of childhood memories. He will be fully ready to move forward.
893	9758	4	3	Saeng buys a beautiful winter hibiscus to plant in the garden, which will also remind her of her beloved homeland. She has unfortunately failed some sort of test and is quite upset over it. Her mother, feeling bad for her, doesn't get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After carefully planting the hibiscus, Saeng says to herself, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding” and “the geese return”. It must be a test that you can only take once a year because she clearly says that “In the spring” she will take the test again.
894	9759	4	3	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is trying to tell the reader a meaningful message. The author is trying to say that if a plant can make it through the cold, harsh winter then she can surely pass her driver’s test. That is the main reason why I think the author included that paragraph.
895	9760	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it clearly shows hope and strong determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again” shows her firm determination and unwillingness to accept failure. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and desperately wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time, she was going to bravely put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many valid reasons why the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
896	9761	4	3	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost familiar to her now."" This realization shows her growing adaptability. So the author lastly concludes that even though she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. By using this analogy, the author effectively gets the point of the story across, and it's a ""cheerful"" way to end it as it leaves the reader with a sense of optimism."
897	9762	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."", to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped her get through some rough and difficult times. In the story, Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was extremely upset, her head hung low as she trudged along. On her way home, Saeng saw a familiar flower. Intrigued, she walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee, noticing her interest, kindly pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many warm and vivid memories of her hometown in Vietnam. Saeng carefully planted her flowers in the vegetable garden. That flower had given her a glimmer of hope, a reason to keep going. She is now ready to try the @CAPS1 test again, with newfound determination."
898	9763	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example, it is starting in the winter and the hibiscuses are dying, their once - vibrant petals now withering away. Also, she is leaving and won't come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring. The spring represents a time of renewal and new beginnings. And she will come back again when she takes the test over again. This cycle of leaving and returning, like the changing of the seasons, gives the story a sense of continuity. In conclusion, that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph as it ties together the themes of time, change, and the promise of a fresh start.
899	9764	4	3	The reason the author of “Winter hibiscus” ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end of a moderately depressing story. After all the challenges the main character has faced, this ending provides a ray of light. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving forward. The power of hope and determination can overcome even the toughest of obstacles. And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. It's all about perspective and the will to persevere. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end, to inspire the readers and leave them with a positive message.
900	9765	4	3	The character has what seems to be a new - found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her homeland comforting her and motivating her. The sight of the plant fills her with a sense of warmth and belonging. She says when those things come back, like the return of the geese and the blooming of the flowers in spring, she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time to push herself, a clear goal with a specific deadline. As most people try to do, she is using this time - bound commitment to focus her efforts and channel her energy towards achieving her objective. This shows her growth and resilience in the face of setbacks.
901	9766	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time is just right for you to try again. This concept is a valuable life lesson that the author skillfully weaves into the narrative. For example, in the book it says “Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, ‘How strange to see it in a pot.’ Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.” This shows that anything can be done when the time is right, whether it's a plant thriving in an unexpected environment or a person achieving their goals after waiting patiently for the opportune moment.
902	9767	4	3	Emotions, symbolism, and the realization of certain themes are all reasons the author concluded the story that way. A key reason the author ended the story that way is to leave the reader with mixed emotions. These emotions include sadness, hope, and wonder. The author makes the reader feel sad as the girl fails her test and misses her home deeply. The author also gives the feeling of hope that one day they will return to the place they long for. And there is a sense of wonder because the conclusion leaves a lot of questions to be answered. The author uses symbolism in the concluding sentences by giving the plant and the geese a sense of importance in the story. The plant is closely related to the home that she truly misses. In the final part of the story, the author leaves a lot of room for different perceptions on several aspects. For instance, the importance of the plant and why they moved from a place that they loved so much. That is why I firmly believe the author ended the story that way.
903	9768	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng is fond of beautiful flowers that once grew in her homeland. Her favorite flower was the winter hibiscus, which had beautiful red petals as soft as velvet. The vivid color and texture of these petals made the flower even more special to her. She also failed a test that she had taken. So what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as what's at home, but sometimes you just need another chance at something. This could mean that Saeng can learn from her test failure and have another opportunity to succeed, just as she might one day find a way to recapture the beauty and comfort of her homeland.
904	9769	4	3	I think he did because he wanted to show how he deeply loved everything in life. He aimed to convey that every aspect of life, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, holds value and beauty. By his actions or the way he presented things, he wanted others to see the world through his eyes, where love for life was all - encompassing. This love could be for the simple pleasures, the natural world, or the relationships he had. In this way, he hoped to inspire others to also cherish and appreciate the full spectrum of life.
905	9770	4	3	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that the plant went through, it will still face challenges at the end of the winter. The plant has endured various difficulties throughout the story, and the harsh winter is yet another test. The author said that the plant will take that test again, and that test is surviving through the cold winter and blooming at the end of it. This ending serves as a metaphor for resilience and the ability to persevere. It shows that even after facing hardships, there is always a chance for growth and renewal, just like the plant that may bloom after the long and cold winter.
906	9771	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many well - thought - out reasons. One key reason is that the author is trying to convey that she is determined to overcome the obstacle, which in this case is the test, no matter what challenges come her way. In the text, it says “it can make through the cold months.” This statement not only reflects the resilience of nature but also supports the idea presented in the last paragraph. Additionally, she is in a new country and is embarking on a new beginning. The text mentions “Not like the same kind we had before.” This implies that things are different in this country, yet she will soon adjust to the new environment. Finally, it says, “this hibiscus is budding,” which symbolically means that just like the hibiscus, she will bloom and thrive in her new situation.
907	9772	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng finds herself alone, and she is reassuring herself that she is going to retake the test she failed. Now that she has started to get accustomed to her new home, having found something that vividly reminds her of her life before she left, she has the motivation to try again. This new - found sense of familiarity in the foreign land gives her the courage to face the challenge of the test once more, and the author uses this paragraph to convey Saeng's growing determination and adaptation.
908	9773	4	3	The author ends the story in this way so that readers can fully understand the theme. The theme is that you can always start over after a mistake is made. For example, Saeng failed her driving test, and it took an emotional toll on her. However, she decides that she will try again in the spring. It seems that she figures that once she has renewed herself, both mentally and emotionally, she'll perform better on the test. This ending shows that setbacks are not permanent and that there is always an opportunity for a fresh start.
909	9774	4	3	Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It all makes a little sense to conclude the story with this. Here's why I think it does. The paragraph is one of the main pieces of the story. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return,” all she says is that when the snow is gone and the grass comes back, she will start planting again and she will be happy with it. “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She plans to put her plants up again and test them to see how they've fared so that she can do even better next time. Saeng loves this plant so much that she can't wait for the right time. But when it does arrive, she is going to plant a lot. That's what the paragraph is saying – Saeng is going to wait patiently so she can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to the United States, she has loved the flower very deeply, and this waiting period is a time of anticipation and hope for her.
910	9775	4	3	Because to her, spring is the best time to do things. When spring arrives, all the happy memories return along with the geese and the budding hibiscus. The return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus are like signals of new beginnings and the revival of joy. These natural phenomena bring back the warmth and positivity that she associates with good times. It is during this season that she feels most inspired and ready to take on new challenges and make the most of life.
911	9776	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the vibrant hibiscus serves as a powerful motivation for her to take the driver's test. In the spring, as the thick snows gradually melt away, the geese gracefully return to their familiar grounds, and the hibiscus begins to form delicate buds, she will gather her courage and take that test once again. By tying her test - taking to these natural signs of renewal, she finds the strength and inspiration to face this important challenge.
912	9777	4	3	Several reasons contribute to this. First, in spring, after a few months' time, she will have had more ample time to fully adjust to her new life. Also, when the hibiscus starts budding, its gentle presence will make her feel comforted, as though it automatically brings back warm and vivid childhood memories. It also serves as a strong link to her past home in Vietnam, where hibiscus might have been a common and beloved sight. When the hibiscus successfully adjusts to its new life in the ground soil, growing roots and thriving, she too will adjust and be fully ready to take the test again. It's as if, when the plant is on the verge of starting to bud, she will also reach a state of readiness. This connection between her and the hibiscus shows how nature can influence her emotional and mental state.
913	9778	4	3	The author concludes the story with that sentence, which is like a solemn vow to the flower. It's just clearly stating that Saeng will come back with determination and try again next year, and see if things work out well with the hibiscus. This vow represents her hope and perseverance. She believes that with the passage of time and the cycle of the hibiscus, there is a chance for a better outcome. It shows her unwavering spirit and the significance she attaches to this flower in her life journey.
914	9779	4	3	The author put the paragraph in to show that he/she deeply care about the flowers. Flowers only come out during the beautiful spring and @DATE2 time, and that's when one can carefully plant and study all the wonderful things that grow in a garden. By observing the growth of these flowers, she can gain knowledge and confidence. So, she can use this knowledge to pass the test and then be truly happy with the flourishing garden, enjoying the fruits of her labor and the beauty of nature.
915	9780	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the thick snows slowly melt and the geese return in their characteristic V - formation and this hibiscus is budding with tiny, promising buds, then I will take that test again” for a couple of well - thought - out reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents a powerful symbol of hope - the plant will bravely survive through the harsh winter months and will grow again, gradually becoming strong and resilient. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange and unfamiliar place where she doesn't want to be, surrounded by foreign customs and landscapes, she is able to find the inner strength to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the cold and unforgiving winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the clear impression that despite the difficulties, Saeng still has a glimmer of hope in her heart, and that hope will guide her forward.
916	9781	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng makes a solemn vow to herself. “In the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and the hibiscus is gently budding, then I will take that test again.” This vow clearly means that she will start afresh, make positive changes, and adapt well to her new life. She doesn't want to disappoint her mother, and she won't be broken down by the painful memories. She concluded the story like this to vividly show in the future how her life will transform and how she would learn to whole - heartedly like where she is now.
917	9782	4	3	"The author concludes the story by the paragraph that says, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow slowly melts and the geese steadily return and this hibiscus is delicately budding, then I will take that test again”. The author wants to convey that Saeng isn't going to give up easily. She is firmly determined to take and successfully pass the test. It also means that Saeng will patiently wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get significantly better. The situation that she is in improves as it says, ""The snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding.” This clearly shows her perseverance and hope for a better outcome."
918	9783	4	3	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it clearly shows that by spring, she will be well - prepared to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who carefully care for their journey and come back, she will have sufficient time to thoroughly study and pass her test. In the story, the author includes this last paragraph to truly demonstrate her strong dedication to eventually grow to be completely comfortable in her new home and to pass her driver's test all in good time. Saeng wants to be at ease with her new life but isn't yet because of what one deeply misses. But she knows that after this difficult phase, she can go back and try again just like the geese do during our long winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really powerfully communicated Saeng’s message of unwavering dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving.
919	9784	4	3	I think the author concludes like this because it's almost like a brand - new beginning. The ending of the story makes you strongly think that Saeng is going to get on with her life in a positive way. It makes me think that Saeng plans to start her life over in a beautiful comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant “starts over” (rebuds) in a fresh and vibrant way, she will start over once again. It also shows that she is resolutely determined to continue on with her life in her new location. She will not let her life be severely distraught by her move from Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again with a new sense of purpose. The ending is a “cliff hanger” to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still a great possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn't let her failures tightly control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to bravely overcome this challenging situation.
920	9785	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's a very good ending paragraph that subtly grabs your attention a little bit. Also, it clearly shows that the girl is firmly determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a story full of determination. The way she vows to take the test again at the right time showcases her strong will. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph, as it effectively encapsulates the spirit of perseverance and hope in the story.
921	9786	4	3	The author concludes the story in this way to clearly show that Saeng firmly intends to try again. An obvious example of her determination to try again is when she carefully sees the plant and then deeply realizes what it truly symbolizes to her. Another telling example is her earnestly saying that she wants to plant the hibiscus herself so that she can always hold the precious memories forever. This is precisely why the author concludes the story in this meaningful manner.
922	9787	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was trying to convey that since the hibiscus is now planted, we are going to closely observe how it fares during the harsh winter. And when the warm spring arrives and the hibiscus is still standing strong, she can confidently go take the test. I think the author was subtly comparing the hibiscus to their life and the various obstacles they will inevitably go through. So, if the hibiscus is still standing, then that clearly means everything will be fine to the extent that she can go back and take the test with a calm mind.
923	9788	4	3	The last paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” vividly describes determination and the remarkable growth of a person. Saeng resolutely says that when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Just as the hibiscus gracefully blooms, Saeng will bravely bloom forth and tenaciously strive through the cold winter to try and successfully pass her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a profound realization that she can't be sad forever. She must be highly determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a kind of beautiful renewal, starting fresh and emerging as beautiful as a hibiscus in full bloom.
924	9789	4	3	The Author of “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho, concluded her story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, flying gracefully in the sky, and the hibiscus is blooming brightly, Saeng will take her driver's test again, because she wanted to end on a truly happy note. In the beginning of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the new place, unfortunately failed her driver's test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her extremely sad. “I mean it's not like the kind we had at – at -” she found that she was still too shaky to say the words “at home,” lest she burst into tears again. (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could focus on that, and get her mind completely off of everything else.
925	9790	4	3	"The author concludes the story with these paragraphs for a very good reason. In a way, she is just letting go of her current worries and will patiently wait to take it again. I think it is really good that she found the flower. That is because it allowed her and her mother to connect in a way and, in a sense, make her feel better. For example, when it says ""the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it shows her new - found hope and patience. This is why the author's way of concluding the story is so fitting."
926	9791	4	3	The author concludes the story in this manner to vividly show how the main character, Saeng, has undergone a remarkable change from the start of the story to the end. It clearly shows a small yet significant amount of new - found confidence that Saeng now possesses. This ending also powerfully shows how much of an impact the “Winter hibiscus” had on her, as it brought back vivid memories of her old country. If Saeng hadn't found the hibiscus, she would have never begun to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her rich past but also helped her carefully compare her new home to her old one. Through this comparison, she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad after all, and that she still carries a little bit of her old home with her every single day. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to muster the courage to want to try the driving test again. This ending effectively shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small but meaningful gain of hope and confidence.
927	9792	4	3	The author decides to conclude the story with that particular ending because she strongly wants the moral of the story to be firmly burnt in your head. She whole - heartedly believes that you will always have a chance to try again, just like the flower restarts its cycle and gets another chance to bud. This symbolizes that you can start over and try again, much like the girl is going to do on the test. She is scheduled to do the test again when the flower starts over, so she can take the test in tandem with the flower. The flower budding will then support her and give her the much - needed hope to succeed.
928	9793	4	3	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it effectively talks about both of the key subjects. The author is trying to convey that when the protagonist takes her driving test next spring, the hibiscus will instill in her the necessary confidence to pass her driving test. The hibiscus, with its budding, represents a fresh start and a source of positive energy that will help the girl face the test with a new sense of determination.
929	9794	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story in a way that clearly shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is having a heartfelt conversation with her mom at the end of the story, she firmly says, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” She is explicitly stating that she wants to start over and gradually adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to patiently wait until the seasons change to go take her test again, as she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she desires a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is precisely why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way, as it reflects her hope for a new beginning.
930	9795	4	3	I think the author concludes the story like that because it is effectively showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she has grown up more and perhaps she'll be well - prepared to take the test since now she has experienced how it is. Also, because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more at ease and relaxed. It will all give her a strong sense of a secure home feeling. As she says, “hibiscus is budding,” this way the flower will be starting anew and so will she, ready to face the driving test with a fresh perspective.
931	9796	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show that she, like Saeng, needs to gradually adapt to the new country. She patiently wants to wait until the hibiscus is budding. The plant's budding clearly shows that it is adapting well to a new environment, just as Saeng is in the process of adapting. The story makes it evident that Saeng is not yet used to the new country. She often cries when she sees the plants because they strongly remind her of her old home. The plant also gently comforts her. When she fully adapts to the new country, then she will surely take the test again, ready to face new challenges.
932	9797	4	3	The author concludes this story with “when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the gentle snow melts and the geese gracefully return and this beautiful hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This is because Saeng didn't pass her test and she clearly knew her mom would be mad, so that's precisely why she got the flower. If she would've passed her test, she probably wouldn't have got the flower in the first place. The flower now serves as a symbol of hope and a reminder for her to do better next time.
933	9798	4	3	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vow to herself because it effectively shows how extremely important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her strong determination because it deeply reminds her of home. Saeng says “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower gives her unwavering confidence. It vividly reminds her of her warm home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it powerfully symbolizes the importance of the flower, which is a constant source of inspiration for Saeng.
934	9799	4	3	She feels very deeply connected to this hibiscus plant because it vividly reminds her of her beloved homeland. I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows its inner budding, she will too. The plant has to diligently try hard to produce beautiful flowers, and the sun has to come out to gently melt the snow. So that means when it comes around to it, she needs to bravely come out and melt all of her bad habits and get what she needs to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the precious memories left behind. “…vowed silently to herself …then I will take that test again.” With the hibiscus as her motivation, she is ready to face the future.
935	9800	4	3	In the story “winter @CAPS1” the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding, she is going to be right back out there enthusiastically exploring. She's going to be eager to learn more about the hibiscus and what unique things they do. And she can hardly wait to start carefully taking care of them as they start to bud. That's why they ended the story with that paragraph, leaving a sense of anticipation and hope for the future.
936	9801	4	3	There are several reasons this paragraph is included. It clearly shows that the flower will offer emotional encouragement to her when it is in the budding stage, as it will vividly remind her of home. This is evident when she says “a blossom of two would have blown into the well”. Such a statement powerfully reminds her of her homeland. Moreover, it also serves to illustrate that she is adapting to her new home. When the geese flew by, she remarked that she realized many things that she previously regarded as strange had now become almost familiar to her. This clearly demonstrates how she is adapting and has now started to enjoy her new life. This final paragraph is important as it effectively shows how her life is gradually changing.
937	9802	4	3	The author is specifically saying that she will be ready soon enough. When the flowers start to grow gracefully and the geese begin to return home in their characteristic formation, she will be fully ready to face whatever lies ahead.
938	9803	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she unfortunately failed the driver's test. She is expressing that when it gets a bit warmer outside and the plants start to grow healthily, maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully achieve a passing grade. I know that she failed the test because the text clearly stated “As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test”. I surmise that the snow being on the ground likely caused her to make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that is precisely why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, highlighting her hope for a better outcome in the future.
939	9804	4	3	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus”, the author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snow gently melts and the geese return in their seasonal migration and this hibiscus is in the process of budding, then I will take that test again” to make a significant point. She genuinely needs all of those things to happen for her to be in a mentally and emotionally sound enough state to take the test again. This shows her reliance on the natural cycle to regain the confidence and readiness required for the test.
940	9805	4	3	The author ended the story this way because the plant symbolically represents new beginnings, which Saeng desperately needs. Seang failed her test and was in great need of some comfort. She went to the greenhouse and spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that sweetly reminded her of her home. At the same time, the hibiscus plant also gently reminded her that her new home is yet another new beginning. The hibiscus plant instills better hopes in Saeng, making her believe that starting over can indeed be a positive thing and that the next time she takes the test, she will surely pass.
941	9806	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. The reason why he does so is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second, he likes plants and the seasons in which they bud. He firmly vowed that he would take that test in the spring. He can't wait until the snow completely melts so that he can take the test and move forward.
942	9807	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she desires that same environment and all the elements she wanted before when she took the test, hoping to recreate that familiar and favorable setting.
943	9808	4	3	The author's choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe, sent a signal to let the reader know that the story continues. But, I think that the test is there to remind her of home, evoking a sense of familiarity and comfort.
944	9809	4	3	The Author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She concludes it with this because she begins the story with Saeng failing her driver license test. Also, she thought that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away and how she became familiar with the geese. She put these elements together and that's why she said when the geese come back and the snow melts... That is why she said it.
945	9810	4	3	I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to, meaning that Saeng didn't pass the test. I feel she meant that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To me, this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden. This also relates to Saeng; even though she failed the test, there is always another chance. We can make up for that loss and retry and try to succeed at this one, just like nature renews itself in spring.
946	9811	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this sentence: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness for the place she used to live before. It's not a real one, I mean not the kind we had at home. She was still too shaky to say the words “at home.” When the hibiscus buds, she will still be fond of her home, but she will have adapted better to her current environment. The geese will have returned to their home, which means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place, she will find herself ready to “take the test” or do things normally. The author concluded the story with that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life.
947	9812	4	3	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Just like the geese are coming back, she is positive that she can take the test again. She firmly believes that she will pass the test. In the story, she said, “Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This means that when she had just moved here, she thought that everything was strange because she had not seen anything like this before. Now, as she is living here, she will get used to it because she knows what will happen, and nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now. By concluding the story in this way, it shows her positive outlook and the gradual acceptance of her new life.
948	9813	4	3	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again and take that test. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, the girl, took a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brought back memories from the past and decided to take this test now that things are going to get better again. Also, when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring. And when they do, her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past, and she will retake that test and pass. These are some clear examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph, as it shows the girl's hope and determination for a better outcome.
949	9814	4	3	The author concludes the story with that part because she loves her homeland, and she loves nature and loves her mother. She adores the greenery and can't wait until spring comes. So she will take the test of being out of place to herself. That is why she concludes the story that way. Her love for her homeland and the natural world gives her the strength and motivation to face the challenges of being in a new place. By ending the story in this manner, it reflects her inner resolve and the hope for a more comfortable life in the new environment.
950	9815	4	3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girl's determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well. Her vow to retake the test shows her strong will. But leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action. The reader is left wondering whether she will pass the test and how her life will unfold in the new environment. This way of concluding the story effectively engages the reader and makes them eager to know more about Saeng's future.
951	9816	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng is gradually getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng explicitly says that many things which she initially thought were strange had now become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus, with its unique presence, was comforting to her and strongly reminded Saeng of her home. She mentions “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to truly get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a very distinctive V shape in the sky, are also becoming increasingly familiar to her. The last paragraph is an extremely effective way to end the story as it vividly shows that Saeng is becoming well - accostumed to her new surroundings and is full of hope for the future.
952	9817	4	3	When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is gently budding, then she will take that test again. The author's main purpose of these lines was to firmly grab the readers' attention by creating a continuing paragraph that shows Saeng is adapting to circumstances. Saeng deeply values the uniqueness of plants, and she is also greatly comforted by the memories of her homeland. This indicates that she is finding a way to integrate into her new environment while still holding on to her roots.
953	9818	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to conclude that she will patiently wait a little bit of time, until the plants can be in abundance so that if she fails again, she will have something tangible to hold on to. For example, when Saeng “failed the @NUM1,” she tried to overcome the feeling of failing by carefully buying something that vividly reminds her of her country and brings back the memories of the past through this time. Another example is when Saeng “felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),” she completely forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to @LOCATION1 to failing her test. This feeling concentrated her on feeling like home again. In conclusion, the author's conclusion creates the firm belief that the way Saeng gets over her problems is by vividly remembering memories like the plant, that strongly reminded her of her home country.
954	9819	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng will be more settled by next year. She said that at first, all the new @CAPS1 things seemed really weird to her when she first arrived here, but now they have become second nature to her. I think that the hibiscus is a symbol of hope and inspiration to her. It represents the connection between her past and present. I think that she finally realizes that she is in @LOCATION1 to stay and she cannot easily go back to Vietnam. So she has to whole - heartedly accept that this is her new home, and I think she is steadily on her way to doing that, gradually building a new life for herself.
955	9820	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has unwavering faith for a new start. Saeng closely compares herself to the hibiscus. When the “hibiscus is @NUM1,” she will retake the test. This clearly shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life cycle, so will she. Saeng deeply feels that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2,” then she is equally strong enough to pass her driver's test and successfully live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death and hardship, and spring represents a brand - new life or a fresh beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, “in the spring… I will take the test @NUM3.” This is a definite new beginning for Saeng, a new glimmer of hope that will guide her forward in her new life.
956	9821	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author decided to end it with the sentence “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows that even though the main character Saeng failed once, she will try again. The geese will be coming back to embrace a new spring and the hibiscus will be budding new flowers, so it's like it's starting over again as well. Saeng says that if both the geese and the hibiscus have made it after trying again, then she can too, and this time she will succeed. Also, it shows the determination all living things have to succeed at their main purpose. The flower has the drive to re - bud. The geese have the drive of coming back again during the spring, and the main character has the drive of passing the test. The author of “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho, put that quote as the last line of the story for inspiration. To inspire people to continue the path of life and if you fail a task, try again. So, the author gives you the inspiration needed to keep living your life and face challenges with renewed hope.
957	9822	4	3	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show the hope that nature brings to her. She carefully describes peaceful elements in nature, like the graceful geese flying in the sky and the vibrant hibiscus in bloom, that she draws her inner strength from because they strongly remind her of her homeland. In this way, she’ll always carry a little piece of her cherished past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng closely relates to nature and extracts strength from it. Her mother has a lovely garden, and she relates to it in that she has a distinct past, preferring natural and healthy foods like bitter melons over processed foods from the new place. This final paragraph clearly shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, effectively helping her gradually adapt to living in a new and unfamiliar place. This connection to nature gives her the courage to face the challenges of her new life.
958	9823	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that, I mean she’ll feel more at ease and comfortable in her new environment and she won’t miss her home as intensely. Also, she tried her best throughout the year but failed in a particular task because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and instead spent the money on something else. This failure made her feel disappointed, but it also became a motivation for her growth. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story. It serves as a sign of hope for the character's future, indicating that she can overcome the difficulties of being in a new place and move forward with a more positive outlook.
959	9824	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new lifestyle. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This implies that she is putting more sincere effort into what she does in her new environment and settings. She is learning to adjust to the changes around her and is determined to achieve her goals. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to clearly show how someone can bravely adapt to change, and it gives the readers a sense of hope and inspiration about facing new situations in their own lives.
960	9825	4	3	The author includes this because he’s using metaphors to intricately explain how the author felt about Saeng’s personal life. Through these metaphors, he can convey complex emotions and experiences in a more vivid and relatable way. By comparing aspects of Saeng's life to other things, the author allows the readers to better understand the joys, sorrows, and challenges that Saeng faces. This use of metaphor enriches the story and gives it a deeper meaning. In this way, the author effectively shares his insights into Saeng's personal journey and helps the readers connect with the character on a more emotional level.
961	9826	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it vividly shows Saeng's deep - seated sympathy. After failing the driving test, she realizes she has disappointed her mother. As a result, she sincerely wants to help her mom with the garden. For instance, while feeling extremely bad about upsetting her mom, when she sees her mom gardening, she tenderly says, “Here, let me help, mother,” as her mom's frail beauty deeply touches her heart. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she was so aware of her mom's possible reaction that she didn't dare look her mother in the eye, clearly showing her concern. However, in the end, her mother was genuinely happy about the plant, saying, “It's a beautiful plant, I'm glad you got it.” This warm exchange shows that the mother and daughter share a close and loving relationship. This is why Saeng's sympathy leading her to better herself is effectively shown in the story's conclusion.
962	9827	4	3	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is about a young girl who has a strong passion for gardening and tends to prioritize it over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining that when spring arrives and the winter hibiscus fades away, she will be able to pass the school test she previously failed. Currently, Saeng only has eyes for the winter Hibiscus. For example, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it” clearly shows that she spent all her money on this plant instead of buying any other food. Also, the quote “I failed the test” accompanied by Saeng crying indicates that she failed the test only because she was constantly worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion, over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is no longer around, Saeng will shift her focus more towards school rather than gardening. Maybe then she will pass her test and can later go back to her beloved hobby of gardening as a well - balanced activity.
963	9828	4	3	The author has a well - thought - out reason for concluding the story in this way. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United States and unfortunately fails her driver's test. Saeng has not yet fully adapted to the life in the United States. When she sees a familiar hibiscus plant, she buys it as a keepsake of her memories of Vietnam. The author is trying to convey that since Saeng planted the hibiscus during the cold winter, when it blooms beautifully in the warm spring, she will be mentally and emotionally ready to attempt and pass her driver's test because she will have gradually adapted to the life in the United States. The theme of the story would be that if you are moving away from the place where you grew up, it is a good idea to bring things that remind you of that place so that you can still hold on to a little bit of that culture. Therefore, the author begins and ends the story with the same subject, creating a sense of circularity and connection.
964	9829	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a sentence about retaking the driver's test in the spring, to effectively express the themes of adapting to circumstances and the determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a Vietnamese immigrant. Since the United States is not her homeland, there are still numerous aspects of life here that she is not yet accustomed to, and the story vividly shows her struggle to adapt. For instance, when she sees the flower “Madagascar penwinhle,” she thinks “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild.” The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says “and the geese return.” The geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just as Saeng is trying to adapt to her new life in the United States, and Saeng realizes that their patterns are becoming more and more familiar to her. The very last line says “I will take that test again.” This simple yet powerful statement summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver's test, but also in other aspects of her new life. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus, Saeng observes that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it.” Despite this great difficulty, though, she “Dug out a hole” and is confident that it's strong enough to survive the cold months, just like Saeng believes she will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she keeps trying. The last sentence in the story is highly significant. It expresses important themes and offers valuable insight into Saeng's resilient and determined character.
965	9830	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the symbolic theme. In the story, the hibiscus represents very important things to Saeng, such as confidence, beauty, the ability to adapt, and some qualities she can apply to herself, as well as her precious memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. After this disappointment, she bought the hibiscus to soothe her homesickness. I saw the hibiscus as a sort of metaphor for Saeng. It's the same hibiscus, but growing differently in a different area, just as she is still the same person but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the hibiscus budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland. By the hibiscus blossoming, it can vividly represent her deep - seated love for the homeland. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again,” it is referring to the new confidence she will have later when the hibiscus blooms, which is another instance of the hibiscus - person metaphor effectively used in the story.
966	9831	4	3	The author @PERSON1 concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show that Saeng is starting over. In the spring, when the gentle snows melt and the geese return in their V - shaped formations and this hibiscus is budding tenderly, it symbolizes her new beginning to her life. It means that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she, in the cold month of @MONTH1, deeply misses her old life, her beloved grandmother, the well that was a center of village life, and the fine - toothed comb that held so many memories, she is making an effort. She says “take that test again.” By relating to the test, she shows that she is not ready to give in to the overwhelming @CAPS2 of loss and to her profound grief. In the end, this display of resilience through the imagery of spring and the hibiscus gives depth to Saeng's character and the story's message.
967	9832	4	3	The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the soft snows melt and the geese return in a flurry of wings and this hibiscus is budding gently, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus, with its vibrant petals and sweet fragrance, comforts her. Once the plant is well - nourished and alive, standing tall in its pot, she will be comfortable enough to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant might seem naive at first glance, but it's not that she has comfort in the plant itself alone. The hibiscus vividly reminds her of her warm, tropical home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, just as her tropical home was full of life and color, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the written and practical parts of the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's hope and connection to her past through the plant.
968	9833	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow steadily, so will Saeng in her journey of self - discovery and resilience. After failing the drivers test, Saeng, feeling dejected, goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant. The plant, with its large, colorful blooms, instantly reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants lining their courtyard. The plant then makes her think about all the fond memories, like family gatherings under the shade of those plants. She is comforted by them even though she is sad. She uses this plant as a powerful tool for comfort to help her think about where she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So, with determination, to boost her confidence, she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng carefully tamped down the soil around it. Then she sees geese flying in the clear blue sky which is kind of a symbol for that day, something to remember it by, so for the next year. “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger and ready to face new challenges. In the end, the story shows how nature and memories can empower a person to overcome setbacks.
969	9834	4	3	I think Saeng needs to take the test over because she wants to get her grade up to a satisfactory level. Saeng is worrying about the snow in the spring because she is constantly thinking about the flower getting covered over by it. She fears that the snow might damage the delicate petals of the hibiscus, which holds so much significance for her. Saeng's mother kindly lets her help with the pepper plants, which are growing in neat rows, and the juicy melons in the garden. Her mother also allows her to stay and help prepare dinner. This family time and the connection with the plants gives her both comfort and the motivation to face the test again. In conclusion, these experiences and concerns all play a part in Saeng's determination to retake the test.
970	9835	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers clearly that she’s not giving up as she says “...then I will take that test again.” This simple yet powerful statement clearly states that she still has a glimmer of hope in her heart. The author wants to continue on her test journey to find the right flower that will bring her the success she desires. Maybe it's a flower that represents her growth, her connection to her past, or her new - found strength. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph, leaving the readers with a sense of the character's perseverance and the promise of a new attempt at the test.
971	9836	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during the cold winter months, everything in nature dies down. However, when spring arrives, the world becomes lively again. In this context, Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, struggling and worrying during the harsh winter and then blooming beautifully in the rejuvenating spring. Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her motivated her to stop dwelling in the past and move forward towards the future.
972	9837	4	3	He wrote this piece because he is specifically talking about the various and dynamic weather changes that occur over time. These changes can have a significant impact on the environment and the way we experience the world around us.
973	9838	4	3	The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph because she is basically relating the plants to herself. This means that just as the plant blooms, she will too by taking the test. Her reason could be that, reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had once thought of as strange before had, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost become familiar to her now. Basically, she did as the geese, lifting her head and watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author put this to conclude the story because she was comparing herself to the geese and did as they did, moving forward with determination.
974	9839	4	3	The author describes the last quote because he wants her dream to be achieved. He describes how she realized that many of the things that she had once thought strange had, through the quiet repetition of seasons, become almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family has an American dream. So, the author wants her family to adapt to their new life in America.
975	9840	4	3	She says this because right now it is the cold winter season, and it is difficult for flowers to grow in such low - temperature conditions. So, she is saying that when the warm spring is back, she will take on the challenge of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is the reason why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph, highlighting the cycle of hope and new beginnings.
976	9841	4	3	"The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a distinct sense of hope and determination for the future that resides within Saeng at that particular time. Throughout the story, it seemed as though Saeng was succumbing to despair at the remembrance of her homeland. She wasn't faring well in her new country, and she realized this most acutely when she ""failed her driving test"". But when she walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifully in her homeland confined in those tiny pots and fighting to survive, it vividly reminded her of herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus, she again closely compared herself to it. And that is precisely why when her plant blooms so well in the spring, she will surely pass that test."
977	9842	4	3	The author concludes this and says it to end the story because he thought it would fit well. At Valkay, there is talk about how the hibiscus is yet budding in the winter, and how all the geese will return to their home and stay there because they loathe the winter. This ending adds a certain symbolism and a touch of hope, suggesting that just as the hibiscus will bloom and the geese will find their way back, there is a sense of renewal and homecoming in the story.
978	9843	4	3	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few well - thought - out reasons. One reason is the notable change in Saeng's attitude. In the early part of the story, Saeng is deeply upset and has absolutely no hope of adjusting to her new home. However, by adding that paragraph at the end of the story, it clearly shows that she has found hope and is not going to give up easily. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to illustrate that life continues even in the toughest of situations. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively indicates that Saeng will not always feel this way and that she too will undergo a positive change. In essence, the author concludes the story with that paragraph for a few very good and valid reasons.
979	9844	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, I think, because since the girl failed her test, the bud reminds her strongly of her grandmother's long grey hair. I guess this association gives her a sense of good luck. So, when the harsh winter passes by and the pleasant spring time arrives, those buds start to come back out. And that is when she will gather the courage and take her test again. This is why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story, as it ties together the themes of hope, renewal, and the passage of time.
980	9845	4	3	I am going to tell you precisely why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does so is because it clearly tells you that Saeng is highly confident. It also makes it evident that she won't give up easily in the face of difficulties. Moreover, it shows that she is whole - heartedly willing to take her ability to the next level and strive for improvement. All these aspects combined make it a fitting conclusion. This is exactly why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
981	9846	4	3	"THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY HAVE INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"", THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE IN ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A “TEST” OF PLANTING THE BUDS, JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN, SHOWING HER POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES OF HER NEW ENVIRONMENT."
982	9847	4	3	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to clearly show Saeng's determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page, the author writes, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That at least, she could hold onto.” After failing her driver's test, Saeng was feeling extremely foreign and alone in this new place. She desperately looked to the flower as a strong reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back a lot of comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned home. After a heartfelt discussion with her mother, Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must “blossom” in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flower needs time to plant its roots firmly into the ground, just as Saeng needs time to establish herself in her new life.
983	9848	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, perhaps to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” So basically, she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance, to face her challenges anew. The author ended the story with this sense of confidence and courage, leaving the reader with the impression that Saeng is ready to move forward and overcome whatever lies ahead.
984	9849	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She does this to end the story with the hope of taking the test again and doing well. Also, the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself, so she made a vow to do something. Hopefully, this vow will encourage her more and also motivate her to prepare better for the test, demonstrating her growing resilience in the face of difficulties.
985	9850	4	3	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that as the winters coming, things are going to die off and then come back next spring. She's referring to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the vivid thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is anxious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she will experience. This anticipation shows her eagerness to embrace the new cycle of life and the possibilities it holds in her new home.
986	9851	4	3	Well, I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her attitude. Now, it's better known that she is changing. So, she is going to put her full mind to whatever she has to do. She is going to take the test again with some pride and attempt it in the spring when the snow finally goes away, ready to give it her all.
987	9852	4	3	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to vividly show optimism. The whole story had been quite sad, but the ending brings out some glimmers of hope. In the beginning, it says, “@CAPS1 of loss so deep…” (@NUM1), and at the end, it says, “I will take that test again.” (@NUM2), which clearly shows how her attitude changes from being cynical to hopeful. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were, “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM2), it demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well to the new situation. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show a change for the better, leaving a positive impression on the readers.
988	9853	4	3	The author is concluding the story with that paragraph stating when spring and @DATE2 arrives again, then she will take the test once more. This means she will plant the flowers and strive to get them to grow again, sincerely hoping that she doesn't fail at doing so. For example, “Mrs. Lambert, liked it, this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after - taste on the tongue,” which might imply that there are hidden joys and successes waiting for her in the future.
989	9854	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a positive and encouraging note and send a good message. They're not going to quit just because they failed the first time. Instead, they'll gather their strength and try again, showing resilience and determination.
990	9855	4	3	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to clearly show that she was not going to give up easily. She was still determined to take the test again. Maybe she thought she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day after failing her driver’s test. As she walked, she realizes that she recognizes a flower. Intrigued, she went to a florist to see if she could buy it. When she successfully purchases it, she goes home and gives it to her mom, and together they plant it. So, perhaps it can bring back good memories from her home town or just bring her the much - needed good luck, as I believe.
991	9856	4	3	The author concludes the story with this passage because it is highly symbolic. When the geese return in the spring, it will be like a brand - new beginning, a fresh start in the cycle of nature. When the hibiscus is budding, it shows signs of new life, its petals slowly unfurling. When all this happens, Saeng will also have a new and fresh start. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff - hanger for some readers. It makes you yearn for more. Knowing she failed her test, you can't help but wonder if Saeng will pass it in the spring, at the time of a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the new season begins. When the hibiscus blooms, it will be as if she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, form new connections with her past, and find comfort during hard times. The hibiscus truly symbolizes all these positive changes and new beginnings.
992	9857	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this is precisely what the story was all about. Saeng closely observed what occurs during the winter. When winter comes around again, she tries hard to memorize every detail, so that she can know exactly what will happen in advance, as if she is preparing herself for the cycle of the seasons and the events that come with it.
993	9858	4	3	The author ends the story this way because by the time winter draws to a close, she will have gradually adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus patiently adjusts to its new environment. The hibiscus may face the cold of winter but still manages to thrive when the right conditions arrive, and similarly, she will find her place in this unfamiliar society as the seasons change.
994	9859	4	3	"The young girl Saeng, from the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, has left her homeland of Vietnam and moved to the United States. The young girl was full of hope as she aimed to get her driver's license, but unfortunately, she failed. The hibiscus she sees provides her with comfort, vividly reminding her of Vietnam. When she decides to purchase it, her mother is initially concerned about the price. However, she soon sees how homesick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After carefully planting the hibiscus, she watches the geese flying in the sky and realizes that every year they change their habitat, following the rhythm of nature. The geese, along with the hibiscus, inspire Saeng. She promises herself that “in the spring when the snow melts away, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.”"
995	9860	4	3	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. With this, Saeng tells @LOCATION1 that once all the snow has completely disappeared, she will take the test again. If one reads between the lines, it says more than just this simple statement. She truly has a deep affection for the hibiscus. When the hibiscus comes back to life in the spring, with its leaves turning green and flowers blooming, she will gain new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus, we can clearly see that this plant really influences her. This is because this plant reminds her so much of her old home, with its familiar shape and fragrance. Also, we can understand that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case, it is the test she wants to retake. Also, in the spring, after living in @LOCATION1 for a couple of months, she will gradually adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment, she is just homesick, even though her new home is @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is very good for her; it is something she can firmly hold onto from her old home, a precious link to her past.
996	9861	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, finishes the story in this manner to vividly show the overcoming of obstacles. The story clearly depicts the numerous difficulties Saeng encounters when leaving her old home and coming to her new one. On the day described, she fails a driver's test, doesn't have lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph effectively shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, facing many challenges such as the cold, its small pot, and even its general surroundings. In every aspect, the plant is in the same circumstances as the main character, and the last paragraph is used to firmly link them, emphasizing the shared struggles and resilience.
997	9862	4	3	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was suggesting that the snow will go away in spring time, indicating a change from the cold and harsh conditions to a more pleasant and hopeful state. This idea likely ties into the overall theme of the story, perhaps symbolizing the end of difficulties and the start of a better period. In conclusion, the use of this paragraph serves to convey this important seasonal and symbolic message.
998	9863	4	3	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus, resilient and perseverant, to take the test again in the journey of life. Just as the Hibiscus endures various conditions and will come back in the spring, we too should have the courage to face setbacks and try again. So, as you can see, the last paragraph has a very profound and inspiring meaning to it, encouraging us to keep going despite difficulties.
999	9864	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because this clearly shows that Saeng is willing to change, and she wants to achieve this change by the time spring comes. By change, Saeng wants to feel comfortable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live without having to break down and cry. Also, the author uses the geese as an example because they need to leave home every year and they manage to deal with it, suggesting that Saeng can deal with her situation as well. This comparison emphasizes the idea of adaptability and resilience, wrapping up the story with a positive message about Saeng's potential for growth.
1000	9865	4	3	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something, you truly need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test, she is deeply disappointed. After failing her test, she went to a greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then, she bought the hibiscus there. It reminded her of how things were different and how things change when you go to a different place. Sometimes, they aren't so pleasant at first, but you gradually get used to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a ""V"", she thought of how strange it was. But now it is familiar to her. After failing her driving test, Saeng learns that even though things may have changed, she needs to be able to gather her strength and try again, highlighting the importance of perseverance in the face of change."
1001	9866	4	3	She concluded the paragraph with that particular paragraph to clearly show that she is truly serious about her gardening. Moreover, she stated that she won't start gardening until the geese come back, indicating a unique connection to nature's cycle.
1002	9867	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is an absolute nature freak. She has a deep - seated love for nature and would never, under any circumstances, hurt nature in her life. I guess they wanted to end the story on a positive and harmonious note with a nice paragraph. So, it's evident that she needs to take that test again to prove herself.
1003	9868	4	3	The author concludes this story because it vividly shows her determination. The text clearly states that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life until she fully accepts her new home. It also makes an interesting comparison, saying that as the buds grow, so will she, but more mentally than physically. Her decision to take the test again implies that she has strong faith in herself. She believes she will mature and grow up to be a person who can both miss their homeland and accept the new home they live in. That is precisely why the author ended the story this way.
1004	9869	4	3	She is saying here that when spring comes around, she is going to start afresh, like turning over a new leaf. She is determined to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng is not a quitter. She is going to put in more effort and try harder to achieve her goal.
1005	9870	4	3	Reserved aspects need to be checked keenly to ensure that nothing is overlooked and all necessary details are accounted for.
1006	9871	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brutally fierce, or perhaps the author never wanted to be around while the cold was in full - blown session. At that particular time, it was really bone - chillingly cold. This ending effectively sets the mood and leaves a certain impression on the reader.
1007	9872	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to show sympathy for the hibiscus, a symbol that holds significance in the story. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesn't want her mom to think that she is going to give up easily. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly, I think that this last paragraph shows how Saeng wants people to know that even something as small and seemingly meaningless as a plant can help her overcome obstacles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself, which leaves a positive and inspiring note for the readers.
1008	9873	4	3	The author of the story chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her driver's test. But when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, “And that rich, sweet scent – that was familiar too,” where she elaborately talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she recognized the distinct scent. Saeng was already deeply upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1. Then coming to @LOCATION2 and failing her driver's test just made it worse. But then she saw the flower and it vividly reminded her of her home, so she felt a little bit better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms, which gives the story a hopeful ending.
1009	9874	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis. Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her that everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and clearly proves they can survive, she will too. She will take that driver's test then with renewed determination. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in themselves. You just need to get used to your surroundings and find the strength within. This is why the author concluded the story in such a way, to inspire the readers with this message of hope and self - reliance.
1010	9875	4	3	"In stories, authors end them in many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a “touching” affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the points talked about in the story. The first example is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”. In this unique quote, the author vividly demonstrates imagery by giving you a clear mental picture of a silent, lonely girl kneeling down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a deeply touching effect on the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return, hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout the story, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, that's why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story, leaving a lasting impact on the readers."
1011	9876	4	3	The author concludes in the story that Saeng failed a winter test, perhaps due to the unfamiliarity of the test content or the pressure of the winter season. And because of her deep - seated love for the hibiscus plant, which symbolizes hope and resilience, spring, a season of new beginnings, will help her gather the courage and strength to take the test again.
1012	9877	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted the reader to know that just because she failed a particular test or task, it doesn't mean her life is over. She will recuperate, taking the time to rest, reflect, and recharge. Then, she will be ready to attempt the same thing next year with newfound determination and experience.
1013	9878	4	3	The author uses this paragraph to conclude and show that she's going to give the test another try, while also adapting to her new surroundings. For example, the story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now”. This indicates that she is gradually getting used to where she is now. She wants to and is willing to give this new place a chance. Almost as if she no longer finds it as bad as she initially thought. Despite it being different from her home and the place she was accustomed to, she has started to see its positive aspects.
1014	9879	4	3	Maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story, the character did something, like taking an important exam or trying a difficult challenge, and failed at it. However, the failure has not dampened her spirit. Instead, she has learned from it and now wants to do it again with more knowledge and determination.
1015	9880	4	3	The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes neatly. It shows that Saeng has a strong determination to overcome obstacles. It uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story. The Hibiscus represents Saeng's journey of adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter, which is equivalent to Saeng not getting her driver's license. But just as the plant will come back to life in the spring, it represents her determination and ability to adjust. This is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted to the situation and is now determined to overcome this obstacle, thus completing her growth and adaptation journey.
1016	9881	4	3	"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test"" from the story ""Winter's Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the cold winter and the withering fall pass, she will be ready to face the challenge of taking the test again and feel a sense of accomplishment about herself. She lifted her head and watched as the geese's distinctive ""V"" formation was etched clearly against the evening sky, slowly fading into the far - off distance. Reflecting back, I feel Saeng felt that the geese were secretly letting her know that what she was planning to do was the right path forward, giving her the silent encouragement she needed."
1017	9882	4	3	He ends the story this way to show that she has a strong desire and is fully willing to overcome the pain of leaving her homeland. In the story, she enters a green - house. She is in the green house as a way to test her emotional strength. Once inside, she finds a plant that is native to her homeland, and this plant immediately reminds her vividly of her dear grandmother. As she continues to explore, she discovers other plants, and they all bring back memories of her homeland, causing her to shed tears. I think she had a very deep and real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country, she probably cried for days on end because it was as if she had lost a crucial part of her soul, a part that was tied to her roots and her past.
1018	9883	4	3	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started to lose hope in herself. She felt extremely sad due to multiple reasons: moving to the United States, which was a big change in her life; failing her driver's test, which was a setback in her personal development; and also because the plant she bought turned out to be artificial. The author also wanted to show that after going through these difficult times, her self - esteem had gradually gone up. She became more confident and made up her mind that she was not going to give up on herself, ready to face future challenges with a newfound determination.
1019	9884	4	3	The author leaves the story with those words because it shows the reader a large and powerful metaphor in the story. Although the metaphor is not fully detailed, it is self - explanatory that it compares Saeng and her test to the perennial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both share a common trait, which is resilience. Saeng comes back with the determination to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back year after year, buds beautifully, and continues to live. I can relate to this because I remember I entered a triathlon. My goal was to place first. In the first year, I placed @NUM1 overall. Then, as the next year came around, I trained hard every day until the triathlon came again. This time, I placed @NUM2. Just like the winter hibiscus, I came back stronger and completed my goal, showing that perseverance pays off.
1020	9885	4	3	The Author includes that part in his story because it is talking about nature and the beautiful things found in the natural world. There are the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, standing tall and adding a touch of color to the landscape. The tall green grass sways gently in the breeze, and there is a white @CAPS3 fence that gives a sense of boundary and charm. In the story, there are those same types of natural elements that create a peaceful and idyllic setting, making the story more immersive and allowing the readers to connect with the beauty of nature described.
1021	9886	4	3	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For instance, when she says “In the spring, which the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Evidently, she failed the first time and got the plant. Next time, she is confident that she'll pass it as the hibiscus symbolizes a fresh beginning and new hope.
1022	9887	4	3	The author includes these paragraphs in the story because it is spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return. I think the author is talking about winter when it snows continuously and the snow covers everything. Then, when spring arrives and the sun comes out, the snow starts to melt away. One reason is that the author is talking about how the weather changes in a natural and cyclical way, showing the transition from the cold winter to the warm spring.
1023	9888	4	3	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibiscus instead of the plant seeds. So she starts crying as she vividly remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom, which is a sign of new life and hope, is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new beginning next year, suggesting that with the arrival of spring, there will be new opportunities and a chance for a fresh start.
1024	9889	4	3	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show how important it was to her. For example, when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that means she will work harder and put in more effort to make sure she does everything right. So that she can proudly say she follows through on things that are important to her. These are my thoughts on why she included this paragraph in the story, highlighting her determination and the significance of the test to her.
1025	9890	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test, and it's a setback that needs time to overcome. Also, it takes time for a hibiscus to bud, which represents the process of growth and patience. It sounds like a good end because it not only shows the passage of time but also the hope for a better outcome. Plus, she would not want to take the test in the snow as the snow symbolizes the harsh and difficult situation, while spring and the budding hibiscus symbolize new beginnings.
1026	9891	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng feels about the hibiscus. I think the author concludes this way because he is telling the reader that the hibiscus gives Saeng good luck and with this good luck, she will pass the test. In the story, it clearly shows how much Saeng adores the plant. For example, when she got to the hibiscus, she slowly reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool under her fingertips. That's why the author uses that paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng feels about the hibiscus and how it makes her feel confident and ready to face the test.
1027	9892	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can clearly tell by the tone of the last paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author intentionally creates a tone of suspense, making the readers eager to know if Saeng will succeed in the test and what her future holds.
1028	9893	4	3	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of Saeng's struggle to live in another country and her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story on a strong note, highlighting Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating the statement on the test saying “I will take that test again,” the author gives us the understanding that Saeng has not given up and lets the reader know she will stand firm and live a strong life in this new environment.
1029	9894	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for. The author could have also concluded the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long until she can take the test again. Also, Saeng is eager to wait and see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger, which symbolizes her own growth and determination. These are the reasons why I think the author chose to end the story with this paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's hope and perseverance.
1030	9895	4	3	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simply set a time for herself to try again. Saeng has a strong desire to make it in this world and wants to have a good life. That's why she is willing to try new things, and by setting this goal of taking the test again, she shows her determination and resilience to overcome the challenges in her new life.
1031	9896	4	3	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a heart - warming good - day story about a foreign girl earnestly trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She has a deep affection for tropical flowers. The reason the author chose to craft the last paragraph in that way is because it neatly finishes the story. In that poignant ending, when the man goes away and the flowers start to sprout, it's clear that she will make efforts to fit in as spring arrives, symbolizing a new start for her in this unfamiliar place.
1032	9897	4	3	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because its meaning subtly conveys that Saeng really adores gardens, and it's something truly special to her. Gardens hold a unique place in her heart, perhaps offering a sense of comfort and familiarity. Also, when all the snow melts, a sign of the arrival of a new season, she will take the test and hopefully obtain her driver's license, marking a new milestone in her life.
1033	9898	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it represents new beginnings. What I specifically mean by this is that the hibiscus, with its vibrant and hopeful presence, represents new beginnings. She says “When the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This upcoming test will be a new start for her, a chance to prove herself. The plant blooming makes her extremely happy and vividly reminds her of her grandmother. She's saying that by the time spring comes around, she would be fully ready for a new obstacle, just as the hibiscus plant bravely unfolds its petals.
1034	9899	4	3	I believe the author chooses to end the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represents her home, a place filled with memories and a sense of belonging. But she realizes, upon seeing the geese flying south, that everyone has to leave home at some point. This realization has helped her come to terms with what is happening. She will try again for her driver's license soon. When the hibiscus buds again, it will be highly symbolic to her, a sign that she is ready to face the challenge once more and move forward in her life.
1035	9900	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she's showing that the protagonist is trying and desperately wants another chance. She has realized her mistakes and is fully ready to start over. Even though she failed by attempting to grow her hibiscus in the winter, a hasty and ill - fated decision, she is patiently waiting to start over when @DATE1 comes in. For example, in the story, it stated that the “winter hibiscus” was in the ground, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yet familiar to Saeng in the snow. This imagery further emphasizes her journey of self - discovery and the hope for a new beginning, which is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1036	9901	4	3	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because she firmly believes it'll bring her good luck in the upcoming driving test. When she goes back to take the test, she'll have the comforting presence of her homeland symbolized by the hibiscus plant. This familiar sight will encourage her to focus and pass the driving test. When she takes the test again, she'll be more likely to pass due to the sense of home comfort and having gotten used to the area, which is different from her homeland. In order for her to perform well in the test, she needs something to boost her confidence a little more. Having things that remind her of home and the house she currently lives in can significantly help her in being more confident in herself, ultimately increasing her chances of success in the test.
1037	9902	4	3	She said that she was going to take the test again because she is determined to show her mom that she can do it and pass it this time. Instead of constantly worrying over her old home, she wants to focus on this new challenge. By taking and passing the test, she hopes to prove to her mom and herself that she can adapt and succeed in this new environment. This decision to retake the test is a step towards moving forward and leaving behind the anxieties associated with her past home.
1038	9903	4	3	I think that this shows hope because she had truly missed her homeland and kind of found a sense of peace and serenity by being around these flowers. She says “That at least she could hold on to,” meaning the bud. I think that she was extremely upset because of missing home. She vividly missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. Since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded her of her homeland, as the text said “where was the fine - toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, her gentle grandmother.” She was missing all these things. So, I think that by putting her in this situation, it has brought her to a place where she not only misses the people from her homeland but also the beautiful things. And she always has a kind of a part of home with her because of the flower, which serves as a constant reminder of her roots and the happy times she had there.
1039	9904	4	3	In the last paragraph, the reason why the author uses “when they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test.” The author uses this because Saeng finally found comfort. After moving from her homeland, Vietnam, to the United States, she felt extremely homesick. For example, she came across this flower that instantly reminded her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remembered her grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and Saeng got a sense of relief. That's why she vowed that when winter was over and spring came, she would take that test because she had a sense of home within her. This feeling gave her the encouragement and strength she needed. It also shows that even when you are in a different area and facing new challenges, there's always something that can make you remember the warmth and time spent where you come from, which can be a source of motivation.
1040	9905	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because it clearly shows that she is determined to pass the test. It is also like a powerful metaphor. If the birds can fly south, overcoming long - distance challenges, she can surely pass that test. Just as the birds have the instinct and the will to reach their destination, she has the determination and the inner strength to achieve her goal of passing the test. This conclusion emphasizes her resolve and sets a positive note, suggesting that with such determination, success is within her reach.
1041	9906	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to clearly show you that despite the setbacks, Saeng still has a glimmer of hope deep within her and that she whole - heartedly believes she can make things right. Also, it is to show that Saeng will still persevere and try to adapt to her new surroundings and make friends in this unfamiliar place. Saeng is also extremely determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last, it is emphasizing the conflict and how Saeng overcame the emotional and mental hurdles associated with it, leaving the readers with a sense of her growth.
1042	9907	4	3	I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. “When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” clearly proves that she's moving forward with life, and so will all the creatures in the world. They all follow the cycle of nature, just as she is following the cycle of her own personal growth. Also, even though she moved to a new country, it doesn't mean she can't still enjoy the things from her homeland. “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” This shows that she can hold onto her roots while embracing new beginnings. That's why the author put that last paragraph, to beautifully illustrate that life goes on, with all its continuities and changes.
1043	9908	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she really isn't worried about when they take the test again. Instead, she's only genuinely concerned with the plants she picked out, finding a sense of peace and purpose in them. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again, and this extended period gives her more time to thoroughly study, get more prepared, and stay focused. The author also ends this article with this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the first time, she will be back again to take it over. And nothing will stop her from trying to turn that failure into success, showing her indomitable spirit.
1044	9909	4	3	It shows not to give up, it ends almost the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past; each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then, she has the courage and determination to try again later to pass it. Also, the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to, which is a well - crafted and effective way of writing as it creates a sense of circularity and continuity. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn't become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it, they might fall apart. That is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart, demonstrating her journey towards emotional resilience.
1045	9910	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story, Saeng says that she failed the test and was very disappointed with herself. The test must have been of great importance to her for her to be so deeply disappointed. It likely represented more than just a simple assessment; it could have been a symbol of her self - worth or her ability to fit in. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is whole - heartedly devoted to passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentimental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money, and she wants to earn respect from her mom. Earning her mom's respect is a significant goal for her, which is why taking and passing the test seems so crucial to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph, leaving the readers with a sense of her hope and determination.
1046	9911	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author concludes the story with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason that the author concludes the story with these lines is because she is re - establishing the symbolism of the plant. In the text, it clearly stated that the plant buds in the spring, once it has sufficient time to grow and adapt to the new environment. Just as the plant needed that time to adjust, so did the main character Saeng. She had just moved from Vietnam and unfortunately failed her driver's test. Saeng is extremely unsure of her new culture. For instance, it is mentioned that she likes bitter melon, as it says, “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.” She appears to think that she is misunderstood and no one likes her, but just as the plant will gradually adapt to this new life, so will she, and taking the test in spring symbolizes her new - found readiness.
1047	9912	4	3	The author concludes the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and vow silently until then because the spring vividly reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam, there were numerous beautiful wild flowers that filled the landscape. Saeng goes to the flower shop in an attempt to get a piece of that familiar home feeling. It is described that the flower's “leaves were quivering in the wind.” This shows that the plant was not in its optimal state as there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this incident and desperately needed hope. So, by waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again, it will give Saeng a strong sense of home, which in turn will provide her with the hope and confidence to do well on the driving test. In this way, the spring and the blooming hibiscus become symbols of her renewed spirit and potential success.
1048	9913	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng's whole world revolves around the plants. Since the plants are no longer in a favorable state or perhaps gone, there is a significant lack of motivation for her. The plants have always been a source of comfort, inspiration, and a connection to her past and identity. Without them, she feels lost and lacks the drive to move forward. The conclusion reflects how integral these plants are to her emotional well - being and sense of purpose, and their absence leaves a void that makes it difficult for her to find the motivation she once had.
1049	9914	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author's reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng's homeland provides her with a great deal of comfort. These memories are so powerful that they will enable her to pass her test with ease as she will not be nervous. “It was like walking into another world,” said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop after failing her driver's test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was solely focused on the plants and flowers. The flowers transport her to a happy and peaceful place and make her feel at home. It gives her the feeling that everything is going to be alright. This is why the author concludes with such a sentence because as readers, we should understand that memories of her farmland will serve as a source of strength and help her pass her driver's test.
1050	9915	4	3	The author may have concluded the story like that because of the title and the beginning of the story. The title might have set a certain tone or theme, and the conclusion aligns with it. Or perhaps he simply wanted to conclude it in this way according to his creative vision. He may have concluded the story like that to show what exactly happened or what was going to happen next in a subtle way. In any case, it is indeed a good conclusion. It ties up the loose ends of the story in a way that makes sense and leaves the readers with a clear understanding of the overall message, even if some elements are left open to interpretation.
1051	9916	4	3	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk about certain themes or elements earlier in the story that she wanted to tie up neatly with this conclusion, but it's not entirely clear to me from my current understanding.
1052	9917	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's determination. Saeng has been through a lot, such as leaving her homeland and adjusting to a new environment, and she deeply misses what it's like at home. She feels different and out of place in this new world, but she is still strong. Life goes on, and this paragraph shows that Saeng will move with it. The paragraph says, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring will come, as nothing can stop the passage of time. The snow will melt because the weather gradually changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always have her memories of home but she is willing to adapt to her new surroundings. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng's determination to succeed and survive in the new world.
1053	9918	4	3	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. With a resolute look on her face, she went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground, perhaps as a symbolic act to mark her new - found determination.
1054	9919	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph, to give a sense of hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng's homeland, and it makes her feel comforted. It intimately connects her with her emotions and vividly reminds her of the way things are back home. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and she will be able to take the test again. The story is about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles “seem so much more beautiful, as if all the hardships were worth it for this moment of hope and growth.
1055	9920	4	3	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The beginning was very negative with Saeng failing her driver's test, feeling extremely disappointed in herself, and her mother yelling at her, which made the atmosphere quite tense. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will persevere whereas before she was so upset, just like when she stammered, “I - I failed the test.” Then for Saeng to rebound from this event, gave the reader hope and that's why the author did this, to illustrate the power of resilience and the possibility of a brighter future.
1056	9921	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is elaborating on how there will be a fresh new start. Since Saeng unfortunately failed the test, and just as in winter the plant withers away but in the spring it will bud anew, she will retake the test. It's a brand - new opportunity to start things afresh and make a better attempt.
1057	9922	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, as Saeng was someone who didn't really like to talk much. She liked to be by herself at times, enjoying her own company. However, when spring arrived, it was a completely different story. Saeng adored the spring and the warm, sunny days of @DATE2. She would spend the entire day playing outside every single day. Saeng was truly just a kind - hearted and nice girl.
1058	9923	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows that the character will retry what she failed at. In the story, the character has a deep - seated love for gardening. So, when her favorite plant makes its comeback, she will gather the courage and determination to retry and pass her test, looking forward to a better outcome.
1059	9924	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because as winter approaches, everything seems to fade away. For instance, the trees lose their leaves, the geese fly south in search of warmer climates, and the flowers wither and die off. So, this passage is essentially saying that in the springtime, when everything springs back to life, she will start the test again. It is like getting a chance to start a brand - new life all over again and make amends for past failures.
1060	9925	4	3	"In the story called ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes the story with this paragraph: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The reason why the author included this at the end of the story was that when things seem to go haywire and everything appears to be buried underground metaphorically, everyone has the natural inclination to wait patiently until it resurfaces. When one fails, it feels like everything is in a downward spiral, but if you persevere and wait for a while, everything will gradually start to improve, just like flowers blooming and all the other natural phenomena that you can think of. So, that is why the author put that at the end of the story, to convey to people that it is perfectly okay for people to fail. As long as you pick yourself up and keep trying until you reach your goal, there is hope. So, that is what the author was trying to communicate, and that's why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read it and draw valuable lessons from what it says."
1061	9926	4	3	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to carefully set the final mood. By crafting those words, the author wanted to vividly show that Saeng will not give up easily and she will steadily continue to adapt to her new surroundings. The conclusion made the end of the story feel genuinely warm and it also truly inspired. The end of the story effectively encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets a clear example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew well that the last paragraph would stand as a powerful inspiration and maybe help a reader going through something similar to the story, offering hope and motivation.
1062	9927	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to strongly remind her of her homeland, which deeply calms her. When the plant is budding, she feels even stronger. In the story, Saeng is somewhat of an outsider. When she sees the plant, she clearly sees a part of her past back home. In the story, it specifically says she gets shaky when she tries to say “at home”. When she says “and this hibiscus is budding”, I think it is really indicating that when she is ready to whole - heartedly accept this country as her home because the flower is a precious reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story, it mentions how she is getting used to the geese flying in a “V”, showing that she is gradually getting more used to this country. When she is fully ready, she will take her test again, marking her further integration.
1063	9928	4	3	"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to clearly show that hibiscus is a significant symbol of time. Saeng precisely uses the hibiscus to measure the exact amount of time there will be until she takes her test again. The hibiscus also powerfully symbolizes the ability to get through struggling and stay strong. Saeng had real trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there like a reliable support to help push her through it and thoroughly prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also aids the mother in trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story, the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to sincerely make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong throughout their struggles, acting as a constant source of hope."
1064	9929	4	3	This final paragraph goes well along with one of the main premises of the story. The message is to not quit and keep persevering in order to understand and be truly happy in this world. Saeng is taking this “test” to accurately see if she's ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time, but it's just a set - back. When all the circumstances are right and the hibiscus is fully ready, she will bravely try again to see if she's ready to let go of the old and be content with the new, moving forward on her journey of self - discovery and adaptation.
1065	9930	4	3	She said it because she didn't do what she was supposed to do properly. So, she said she failed. Her mother was mad for a short second but then quickly stopped. She said “I love it” and asked if she wanted something to eat. So, they went inside. She took the task as a serious test, so she firmly said next time I will do it right, showing her determination to improve.
1066	9931	4	3	I believe the author ended the story with the “test” because it is a significant and integral big part of Saeng’s life or perhaps a long - standing part of her cultural tradition. This test is deeply woven into her experiences and identity, making it a fitting conclusion for the story.
1067	9932	4	3	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First, that ending gives a rich and intense amount of emotion, which ensures that people don't think the story was uninteresting. It tugs at the heartstrings and engages the readers. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but rather the profound mental strength that Saeng possesses. Saeng is clearly stating that even though she failed the test the first time, she has the determination to take it again. Another reason the author might have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed, yet she is resolute and will not quit but take the drivers test again. Overall, the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image of perseverance, encouraging readers to keep trying and never give up.
1068	9933	4	3	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it vividly shows how deeply dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young child's favorite plant is the hibiscus, perhaps due to its vibrant colors and unique shape. I think that the mother and her child's favorite thing to do together would be gardening, sharing moments of joy and discovery as they tend to the plants. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the reader kind of a look of question on their faces, making them ponder the deeper meaning. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion, I think it adds some delightful curiosity to the story, making it more memorable.
1069	9934	4	3	"The final lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a clear glimpse into the near future, to show a notable change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point, Saeng had been constantly lamenting her old country, and was not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus acts as a powerful inspiration for her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same beautiful and comforting things as her old country. In this last line, she finally comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a symbolic way of saying she's going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver’s test again, she will bravely begin her new life in this new land."
1070	9935	4	3	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and decided to make a detour to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that vividly reminded her of home, filling her with a sense of nostalgia. She bought a hibiscus and went home. She and her mother carefully planted it, after Saeng realized that the flower could make it through the harsh winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she suddenly realized that she has successfully adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the strong will to survive and she firmly knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave Saeng the courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue thriving in @LOCATION1.
1071	9936	4	3	The reason I think the author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this gardening is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very dedicated and will continue this gardening activity every year. She really loves plants deeply and she will patiently wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a great deal of dedication. And she truly values the arrival of spring and the blooming of the Hibiscus, which symbolizes new beginnings and her love for nature.
1072	9937	4	3	The author concludes the story with this line to vividly show that just like the hibiscus, which has to adapt and struggle to survive and fit in in its non - native land, Saeng will also persevere. She will not give up her determined fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This idea is supported throughout the story when her mother comments on the hibiscus by the lake. She says, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters” (Ho @NUM1). Here the author clearly shows the comparison between the hibiscus' arduous struggle through hard times in a foreign land, which is similarly felt in Saeng’s life. Both must be strong and fight through hard times when no one, “not even her classmates or friends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone and out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, she's promising herself she will fight through the hard times and grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus endures and thrives.
1073	9938	4	3	Primarily, the reason why she said that was that she was stating that with the passage of time comes change. She was basically saying that in a while, when circumstances change again, she believes that her performance could also change for the better. I inferred this from the idea that you can tell that she is gradually coming to terms with missing her home in Vietnam, and as time passes, memories evolve. That is a simple aspect of logic that with the flow of time comes change. But I think although I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally, I believed Saeng said this because she firmly understood that time brings about inevitable change.
1074	9939	4	3	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to clearly show readers the great significance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country, she doesn't have many familiar things around in this new place that can offer her comfort. The author being able to unexpectedly find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn't be able to gives her a sense of strength to take on anything that comes her way. It is possible that whatever the challenge in @MONTH1 might be, the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the motivation and confidence to achieve her goal and complete her task successfully.
1075	9940	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar in their resilience. Also, the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting anew at drivers school and having the determination to do it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong during the harsh winter and then, when spring arrives, she builds up her courage and goes to take the test again. That is the profound reason why the narrator chose to end the story in such a meaningful way, highlighting Saeng's spirit of perseverance and hope.
1076	9941	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story like this is to set up a spin - off. I mean, to me, I think that it means she is going to make another attempt when spring arrives. So, she and her plant can get a fresh start, and I firmly believe that is a really good way to end the story as it leaves a sense of hope and new beginnings.
1077	9942	4	3	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” for several well - thought - out reasons. One key reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that the hibiscus flower will be adapting to the spring season just as Saeng should adapt to her new environment in the United States. Another significant reason is that, like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has started to grow older and has become much wiser about various things. This wisdom allows her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This clearly shows that Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease with where she is living, just as the hibiscus flower adapts to its place with ease and gets used to the changing seasons. In conclusion, the author's choice of ending effectively ties together Saeng's personal growth with the natural cycle of the hibiscus.
1078	9943	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that when she comes back, she will take the test over again. This implies that during her time there, it was a test of survival. When the story begins, it marks the start of the test, and at the end of the story, the test is over and they are leaving. She wants to come back to see what has grown. The author is also subtly saying that you don't always realize how good a situation you have until you experience something different. In essence, this ending makes the reader reflect on the value of what we have and the potential for growth in different circumstances.
1079	9944	4	3	Because the “Winter hibiscus” was in the ground, Saeng carefully tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and, yes, meaningful to Saeng now. The honking of the geese seemed to carry a message of change and the passage of time, just as the hibiscus in the ground was waiting for the right season to bloom. This moment was a blend of nature's signs and Saeng's connection to them, making it a poignant part of the story.
1080	9945	4	3	The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows that having a good impression of work ethic and adapting to a new environment can be quite difficult. The statement “not even @PERSON1, looked it” makes it apparent that something is amiss. For a new student, this lack of recognition can lead to a poor work ethic. Moreover, it can also cause mental distress. Therefore, the girl is not comfortable and lacks the enthusiasm to work on something that no one would appreciate. This situation highlights the importance of positive feedback in a new environment for a person to thrive.
1081	9946	4	3	The author concludes with this because she is extremely determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. The setback of the failed test only strengthened her resolve. For example, She writes “she vowed silently to herself.” When you vow to do something, it usually means that you are very firmly determined to achieve it. Everything else that she says after that vow, she truly means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to clearly show her unwavering devotion to her goal of passing the driving test.
1082	9947	4	3	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that paragraph because the author aimed to show that Saeng is finally going to start gradually getting used to her new home. She won't spend so much excessive time constantly dreaming about her past. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that this emotional release is precisely what she needed to move forward and get on with her life in the new environment.
1083	9948	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know the specific time when she'll take it again. When the season change occurs, that's when she will take the test again. Saeng is probably quite embarrassed about her failure, which is why she wants to wait for such a long time. After failing the test, Saeng took a long, contemplative walk home and stopped at the flower shop on the way. She tried hard to get her mind off the disappointment of failing the test. Saeng bought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, but then she realized that her daughter was not happy and quickly changed her mood. Eventually, this small act shows that they will move on from the test - related setback.
1084	9949	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this because he is clearly saying that she will keep persistently trying and will not give up easily and will keep on making efforts. I say this because she has just moved to America from Vietnam and is having a really tough time adjusting to life in America. The cultural and environmental differences have been a huge challenge. I think the geese represent something that is always adapting and changing their surroundings. When the geese come, it symbolizes a new opportunity, and she is going to fly again to get her license, showing her hope and perseverance.
1085	9950	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has a clear and meaningful thing to work for. This goal gives her a sense of purpose. The author could have also concluded the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take the test again. Also, Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger, which might symbolize her own growth and progress. These are the reasons why I think the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph, as it ties together her future goals and the symbolism of the plant.
1086	9951	4	3	Saeng would silently vow in spring that she will take the test again. The good ending to this story was indeed as good as it could be because the story had witnessed a kind of resilience. Just like the beautiful plants in spring, it was a time of renewal. Spring was a time when everything seemed to be on the verge of a fresh start, and for Saeng, it was also a time to take the test again. It was a good ending because the ruler of this new beginning, the spirit of spring, was strong. It was as if the spring and the plants were working together to bring about a positive change. That is why it is a good ending for Saeng to stay and face the challenges ahead.
1087	9952	4	3	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus truly means to Saeng. To her, it is not just a plant but a powerful symbol of strength and comfort. And she firmly knows that if the hibiscus can bravely survive the snow and the harsh cold weather of the winter, then she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a perfect symbol of herself. If it can make it through the tough times, she knows that she too can survive. She is also determined to take the test again when the hibiscus are budding since it vividly reminds her of her homeland and brings her great comfort. Then even if she fails, she will still be happy because her favorite plant is budding, a sign of hope. I also think the author concludes the story this way because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome significant obstacles. The plant must endure the winter and come back in full bloom in the spring. While Saeng must successfully pass her driver’s test. Finally, I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives, she knows that she too will survive, and life will continue to go on, full of possibilities.
1088	9953	4	3	I believe the author concluded the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” because it clearly shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrates this when she firmly says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to gradually get over the changes in life. For example, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair.” The hibiscus was something from her home that brought back wonderful memories. The hibiscus encouraged her to whole - heartedly accept her new life and keep trying to make it better. In this way, the conclusion ties in perfectly with the story's theme of adaptation and hope.
1089	9954	4	3	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time when Saeng feels most at ease and comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, where the winter hibiscus are well - known and very familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this manner because it strongly reminds Saeng about Vietnam and how she feels much better during that time of the year. When she says “And beside it was yet another old friend.” She truly feels as if this plant is a dear friend to her and it makes her feel more at home and comfortable. This deep connection between Saeng and the hibiscus is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did, highlighting the importance of familiar things in a new environment.
1090	9955	4	3	The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start, and it will be spring, a season full of beauty. “@CAPS1 plant it right now” is clearly telling me that she wants another try. She desires a fresh start, and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are blooming and getting their chance to shine, she wants her own chance to pass the test in the best way possible. Spring represents new beginnings, and just like the flowers, she is ready to bloom and succeed. This conclusion shows her hope and determination for a better outcome.
1091	9956	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her deep - seated sadness for the actions she took. The test she was recounting was about how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and make a proper purchase. Unfortunately, she made a big mistake as she spent most of the money to buy a plant which strongly reminded her of home. This last paragraph conveys that when she gets the chance to do the “test” again, she will surely do what she is supposed to do.
1092	9957	4	3	After reading “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I firmly believe Ho ended the story with that particular paragraph to support her clear - cut idea of overcoming obstacles. First, after failing her driving test, Saeng was extremely upset and had serious doubts about whether she would ever pass it. However, after seeing a hibiscus plant, it vividly reminded her of her cherished home in Vietnam, which in turn inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a bit angry because it was quite expensive. But, after seeing how much joy the plant brought to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last, when Saeng was laboriously digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired her to take the test again as she had overcome the obstacles of bringing the plant home and making it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho ended “Winter Hibiscus” to align with her well - defined idea of overcoming obstacles.
1093	9958	4	3	The last paragraph of the story vividly displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus served as a poignant reminder that her “home” was her old life, yet she misses certain aspects in her new life. Through this reminder, she gains a strong sense of determination. She soon comes to a realization that she is home now, as things have gradually become familiar to her, such as the distinctive V formation of the geese. She deeply loved her old home, but she finally understood that it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not merely mean retaking a driving test; it symbolizes the firm determination to whole - heartedly embrace her new home and life.
1094	9959	4	3	I will take that test again. She has gained new - found confidence from the hibiscus and the snow. When the snow slowly melts and the hibiscus starts to bud, then she will go again. It's like she is growing along with the hibiscus. All in all, she is certain to have enough confidence for the test.
1095	9960	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they sincerely want people to clearly know what actually happened in the story. Also, they want people to understand what it might imply or convey in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring arrives and the snow gradually melts, the plants will emerge and start budding. But by next class or next school year, he will gather the courage to come out and bravely take the test all over again. That is the exact meaning of the sentence in the story and how it can be compared to different things in various ways.
1096	9961	4	3	The final paragraph in “winter hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho reads “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph makes a vivid comparison of her to the flowers. Just as the flower is strong and endures through the harsh winter to bloom again, it shows that she is resilient. She is firmly determined to take the test again next year and pass it. Moreover, she would also take the test because it is comforting to her and serves as a gentle reminder of her home. This comparison effectively highlights her inner strength and her connection to the symbol of the hibiscus.
1097	9962	4	3	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 wants you to be intrigued and read on, or it could be that he is skillfully showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The quote clearly shows that the flower can bravely fight through the long and cold winter and come back vibrant. Similarly, Saeng failed the test once and is now resolutely going back to retake the test. This indicates that they both have the motivation and the integrity to overcome setbacks and come back stronger. This comparison makes the story more relatable and inspiring."
1098	9963	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again.” I believe the author concluded the story like this because it clearly shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a brand - new beginning and an opportunity to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it provided her with comfort in a time of deep disappointment, a strong connection to her past experiences, and the confidence that she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, this strongly implies a new beginning, so the hibiscus is indeed representing Saeng. This is precisely why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it ties together the themes of hope and resilience.
1099	9964	4	3	The last line is included in the story “Winter Hibiscus” because it clearly showed the deep connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time, she bravely decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower, just like Saeng, is out of place in the current environment and will have to endure the harsh winter to reach the spring so it can bud again. This vividly shows how like the flower, Saeng will also “bud” again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that Saeng and the flower are not accustomed to the cold and unfamiliar conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to patiently weather the long winter months they are not used to. This further shows again how the last line effectively connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to neatly wrap up the story with a meaningful connection between the flower and Saeng, emphasizing the theme of resilience.
1100	9965	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to gradually get used to the new country and its surroundings. In the story, the author is clearly showing signs of homesickness. The author sees a plant that is well - known from where she comes from and buys it for over @NUM1. Her mother couldn't believe it. She didn't want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was so emotionally shaken that she was afraid to say “home” or start crying again. The last sentence is a clear indication that the author is trying hard to adapt to the new environment, showing her strength and determination in the face of a new and unfamiliar place.
1101	9966	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a well - crafted conclusion that precisely portrays the essence of the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a “comfort in time of distress”, a hobby or a cherished thing she likes doing with her spare time. In conclusion, the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons clearly stated in the @ORGANIZATION1, effectively wrapping up the narrative and leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
1102	9967	4	3	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to effectively get across a profound message. It highlights the things important and familiar to Saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that Saeng remembered as a part of life back home throughout the story. So, when she saw the plant, “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was initially unable to soothe her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and encourage Saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can gradually get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and come to terms with her failed test. Therefore, by mentioning the things she does in the last paragraph, Saeng uses familiar objects, both foreign and domestic, to clearly illustrate her coming to grips with her failure and finding the strength to move forward.
1103	9968	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it effectively expresses the profound meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, and the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a powerful symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong - willed and their lives will continue even though they are in a new and unfamiliar environment. The author chose to end the story with that paragraph because even though she says the hibiscus will come back every spring, the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the resilient hibiscus, will continue to live their lives with hope and determination in the face of change."
1104	9969	4	3	The author chooses to end the story in a very deep, well - connected way. It is ended on a note of rebirth and second chances. When Saeng vows, “When the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming in the spring, I will take the test again.” The author is connecting a sense of a new country and the opportunities of second chances and rebirth. Spring and the snow melting could be clearly connected to the concept of rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a fresh start or a second chance. This is directly connected to Saeng's second chance at the test. The author also shows that Saeng is gradually getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope. It indicates that there is indeed some hope for her to succeed in the test and build a new life in this new land.
1105	9970	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to grasp the moral of the story. I hold this idea because in the story he vividly talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounding her. It details how these beautiful yet challenging flowers surrounded her as a test. This test was a way to assess her @CAPS1, and by concluding with this paragraph, the author ensures that the readers understand the significance of this test within the overall context of the story.
1106	9971	4	3	I think the Author concludes this in the story because it serves as a crucial element. It is a key information for this story. Because the plot revolves around her relationship with her mom. She has a deep - seated love for working on the garden, aspiring to become a gardener and have a fulfilling job, just like her mom.
1107	9972	4	3	Saeng thinks that she has failed because the intense longing for her grandmother weighs heavily on her heart. The hibiscus plant that she buys has a fragrance that vividly reminds her of her grandmother’s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant, as she desperately needed it to feel a little bit more at home in this unfamiliar place. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not shed tears at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to focus on the good memories and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. Next time the hibiscus are budding, she must steel herself and not cry, as a sign of her growing resilience.
1108	9973	4	3	The reason I think that the author did it is because she wanted you to have a clear sense of what time it took place and what the weather was like during that period. Then it also tells you how long she is going to wait, like till the snow melts, and that is going to be a while. And when the geese leave and return home, it gives a natural timeline. So this is why I think she tells you what the situation is like, to immerse the reader in the story's setting and time frame.
1109	9974	4	3	I think that this is about winter hibiscus and hedges tall and lush that surrounded their garden. The hibiscus plants stand out with their lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. She said when she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and gently touched a petal, feeling the soft texture and perhaps recalling memories associated with these beautiful flowers.
1110	9975	4	3	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader with a lasting last thought. Also, it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, “... this hibiscus is budding ...” (Ho @NUM1), she is not only talking about the plant but also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has shown great courage in overcoming the challenges of living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up Saeng's feelings and experiences during the whole time she had moved, “... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1), which clearly tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a fair shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome the difficulties of adapting to a new environment and make a life for herself there.
1111	9976	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants there to be a glimmer of hope for the future. Seeing the hibiscus budding in the spring is precisely what Saeng has been patiently waiting for. This simple yet powerful sight gives her the hope that she will be able to pass that test once again. This is clearly shown when she says “... and if this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” During the cold winter, Saeng hopes that she will improve her skills. When the hibiscus finally buds, she will know that it is the perfect time to try again. Saeng sees the spring as a brand - new beginning. So, it is a time for her to overcome her obstacle. I think that obstacle or test might be to refrain from crying when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus, blossoming into a stronger person.
1112	9977	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for one main reason: to leave a lasting impression on the reader. By ending the story in this way, the author is able to convey a particular message or emotion. This concluding paragraph ties up the loose ends of the story and gives it a sense of finality. It leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the story's significance and the lessons to be learned. In conclusion, the author's choice to end the story with this paragraph is a strategic one that effectively serves the overall purpose of the narrative.
1113	9978	4	3	The author is showing that Saeng has a deep - seated desire to keep on with her mother's gardening. This means taking over the traditions passed down by an elder and continuing what her mother so lovingly started. Gardening was not just a hobby for her mother; it was a part of their family heritage. Saeng understands the importance of this tradition and wants to ensure that it lives on. By carrying on with the gardening, she is also keeping the memory of her mother alive. In conclusion, Saeng's determination to continue her mother's gardening is a beautiful way to honor her family and their traditions.
1114	9979	4	3	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to vividly show the remarkable persistence of the main character. I hold this belief because in the beginning of the story, when she is walking home dejectedly, she clearly states that she failed the driver's test. This setback could have easily discouraged her, but it didn't. In the last paragraph, she firmly states that after winter is over, she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her unwavering persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a resilient plant trying to survive the harsh winter. Just like a plant that endures the cold to bloom in spring, she endures the disappointment to strive for success. In conclusion, the author's choice to end the story this way effectively highlights the main character's indomitable spirit.
1115	9980	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. What it's saying is that she can try every year to get it right in order to impress her mother. This shows her determination and her longing for her mother's approval. Each attempt is a step towards achieving her goal and making her mother proud. The annual cycle of trying represents her unwavering commitment. In conclusion, the author's decision to end the story with this paragraph emphasizes the character's perseverance and her strong desire to meet her mother's expectations.
1116	9981	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author @CAPS1 most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that Saeng thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just flowers. To Saeng, it is also a precious memory. For Saeng, the Winter Hibiscus is like old story - books, waiting to be read. Simply by smelling the flower, it unlocks wonderful memories of the precious time spent with her “gentle grandmother” in her first home. @CAPS1 is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, a thought, and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, that Saeng cares deeply about her past. So, in order to fit in with life today, she must not forget who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden, she can have a beautiful reminder of where she came from. Therefore, one is to believe this reasoning is the assumption as to why @CAPS1 ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph selected, as it encapsulates Saeng's emotional connection to her roots.
1117	9982	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a strong sense of hope when she says “this hibiscus is budding”. That budding hibiscus indicates a new beginning or starting over, a fresh start in her new life. I think that is the key idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously, it was quite difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For instance, she was deeply disappointed that the hibiscus wasn't the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling nostalgic, this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance, to embrace the new beginnings the budding hibiscus symbolizes.
1118	9983	4	3	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of well - thought - out reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is also deeply upset about missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers, with their delicate promise, give her hope and essentially, the inner strength to take the test over again. Also, when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept” (Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean an immeasurable amount to her; they transport her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses dearly. They give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character, and it ties together her emotions and hopes.
1119	9984	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that she loved those flowers deeply. They meant a whole lot to her. When she failed her driving test, she was extremely sad. And those flowers made her feel better, like a comforting friend in a time of distress. Now that the snow is falling, she waits patiently until spring. That's when the flowers will come up again. And with the return of the flowers, she will have faith and take the driving test again, knowing that the flowers will give her the strength she needs.
1120	9985	4	3	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take good care of it still. It's not just about the plant; it represents so much of her past, her memories. Saeng has not forgotten about it, and by showing her continued connection to the hibiscus, the author emphasizes the importance of her roots and the emotional bond she has with the flower. This ending also implies that Saeng will carry the essence of her past with her as she moves forward in life, always cherishing the memories associated with the hibiscus.
1121	9986	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a young teenager named Saeng moves from Vietnam to the United States. She later decides to take a driver's test, but unfortunately does not succeed in passing it. However, she does find comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. These reasons being that Saeng was extremely upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the numerous changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a glimmer of hope to continue her journey even when things get very tough. The winter is this plant's time of trouble and sadness, just as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope. If Saeng continues to find comfort from her past, she will find it easier to get through hardships."
1122	9987	4	3	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to make the readers start wondering. It is a way to show that the protagonist, Saeng, is not going to give up on what she wants to do. By ending the story in this manner, the author leaves an open - ended thought in the readers' minds about Saeng's future attempts and her determination to achieve her goal.
1123	9988	4	3	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test that Saeng failed and her vowing to take it again. In the story, the test was symbolizing a small step towards moving on, a gentle start to her new life rather than living in the past. But Saeng couldn't achieve this on her first try. She spent all her money to buy the flower because it held precious memories of her old life for her. As the story progresses, I think she gradually realizes that she can have both, her old and new life in harmony. I believe the author ends the story that way because Saeng truly wants to try again. She has the desire to please her mom as well as herself. She wants to be able to move on and start her new life whole - heartedly.
1124	9989	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng realizes that she needs more time. She is still adjusting to the new environment and the challenges that come with it. If she takes a break and focuses on what she needs to improve, then by the time @MONTH1 arrives, she will be able to pass the test. This shows that she is self - aware and willing to take the necessary steps to achieve her goal.
1125	9990	4	3	The author concludes the story this way because he can now expand on this story by creating a sequel about Saeng's success. Also, by ending the story in this manner, the author is showing that there is no limit to Saeng's determination. Now she will stop at nothing until her test is successfully completed. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the familiar plants and the previous luxuries that she had in her homeland are no longer present. In the story, Saeng's determination is clearly shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollars to buy a similar plant. The mother responds by saying that their whole garden in the new place is worth less than @NUM1 dollars, yet Saeng's resolve remains unshaken.
1126	9991	4	3	This sentence concludes the passage, clearly demonstrating that when the hibiscus begins to bud and a new season commences, Saeng will transform into a new person and will be well - prepared to take the test. In this very sentence, the cold snow, the fleeing geese, and the potted hibiscus all serve as symbols representing Saeng and her current circumstances. They are either cold, on the verge of leaving, or restricted, mirroring exactly how Saeng feels. However, when a new season arrives, the geese will return, and the hibiscus will no longer be confined to a pot. At that time, Saeng will also mature and be capable of taking the test. This sentence is strategically placed at the end to illustrate the significant growth potential Saeng has, as she has the hibiscus growing alongside her, which will surely inspire her progress.
1127	9992	4	3	The author ends the story with the provided sentence because, as she was trying to convey, when winter is over and the harshest times have passed, there will come a time again to resume gardening. This is metaphorically related to the test, just like the plant she had carefully planted. The plant represents her hope and effort, and just as the plant needs the right season to thrive, she too needs the appropriate time to take and pass the test. This ending emphasizes the cyclical nature of life and the importance of waiting for the right moment.
1128	9993	4	3	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again at another time. The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because Saeng earnestly wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return to their familiar paths, and the hibiscus starts budding. These natural signs represent a new beginning and a time of renewal for her. She intuitively feels ready when that specific time arrives. Saeng is essentially telling herself that she requires more time to fully prepare for this important test. Once she has had sufficient time to get ready, she will undoubtedly take the test again. I firmly believe that this is the very reason the author crafted the paragraph as the conclusion, to highlight Saeng's determination and the hope of a fresh start.
1129	9994	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. The reason is that when the hibiscus starts budding, it will offer her a powerful source of inspiration to attempt and pass the test once more. In order to pass the test, she yearns to feel as if she is back in her home environment. Having vivid memories of her home will act as a strong motivation to encourage her to try again. These memories are like a wellspring of strength and comfort for her. Therefore, this is precisely the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph, to emphasize the connection between her emotional state, her memories, and her determination to succeed.
1130	9995	4	3	The author concludes the story with a paragraph about taking the test again to show that the narrator might be initially upset about being in a new place, but she will persevere and keep trying. The narrator becomes visibly upset when she realizes that the hibiscus is not the same as the ones from her old home. This emotional reaction occurs because she probably deeply misses the familiar things she was accustomed to before. The author skillfully uses that paragraph to portray the narrator as a strong - willed individual who won't give up on recreating a sense of the old life while also showing her willingness to adapt to her new home. The author does this to convey an important message that one should keep striving at something they love. The narrator will continue to make an effort when the geese fly back and the hibiscus starts budding, which are symbolic of a new start. So, the author is essentially saying that if you fail, you should keep trying and set clear goals, never allowing yourself to give up.
1131	9996	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph for many well - thought - out reasons that are likely intertwined with the overall theme and message of the narrative.
1132	9997	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is well - aware that he messed up on the test. He is saying that when spring comes back around, he will definitely be ready to take the test. I know it is spring because he said that when the snow melts, the new season arrives and brings with it a chance for a fresh start.
1133	9998	4	3	When she moved to America, she was immediately captivated by all the beautiful flowers that were in full bloom during the spring. Among them, she saw a blossom that caught her attention. It was a hibiscus. Intrigued by it, she felt an urge to have it. So, she went to the florist to see if they had it in stock. Back where she came from, they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in the old walls. The blossom reminded her of her grandmother with its long gray - like petals, as if her grandmother's long gray hair had been freshly washed.
1134	9999	4	3	In the “passage winter Hibiscus” by Monfong Ho, the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again” symbolizes a brand - new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test, Saeng is facing a personal dilemma, missing her homeland as she states “I – failed the test.” This test meant far more to her than just a simple failure. It was a test of her ability to function in her new country, and unfortunately, she failed. The “when they came back…” quote mentioned above can be analyzed deeply, with the snow representing her obstacles and the hibiscus representing herself. When the obstacles melt away and she blossoms into a new, stronger person, she will take the test again, ready to prove herself.
1135	10000	4	3	She will go back to the very place where she started. It's like a never - ending circle, and she will find herself back at the same spot the next year where her journey initially began, perhaps with new experiences but in the same familiar setting.
1136	10001	4	3	NO IMAGE is present, which might have been expected to add a visual element to the context, but without it, the focus remains solely on the available textual information.
1137	10002	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because the sight of that flower budding would fill her with a sense of confidence about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower vividly reminds her of past - time memories of her beloved homeland. It’s basically like she has a little piece of home, a comforting reminder, in her new home. An example that represents this is, “Not like the kind we had before,” which is explaining that the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this simple yet powerful comparison reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do, creating a poignant and hopeful conclusion.
1138	10003	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to clearly show that Saeng is not just going to give up easily. She is determined to overcome the problem that stands in her way. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is centered around the theme of overcoming problems. If Saeng just gave up, it would completely ruin the positive and inspiring tone of the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home - land with courage, she will eventually pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some significant obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants in an unfamiliar environment. She obviously misses the old plants, and you can tell by the way she immediately knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that sense of loss just like Saeng will do on her test the next time, showing the strength of their characters.
1139	10004	4	3	Everything in the story is about to change. The cold winter will gradually change to the warm spring, the thick snow will melt and slowly vanish, the geese will return from their long journey, the hibiscus will start to bud, and Saeng will also change and mature as well. Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant. As the plant seems out of place on the side of the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country, and she must adapt, just like the hibiscus plant has to adapt to its new environment. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it has matured and grown in this new setting. That is what Saeng must do; she must mature and grow in this new country. For example, Saeng carefully observed how different the plant looked in the shop window compared to how it did in her home country. In that moment, she was also observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already. Putting it at the end effectively shows that she has grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same powerful and impactful effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winter's change, and Saeng is able to do that as well. She made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have, marking a new beginning in her life.
1140	10005	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several important reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story in a way that leaves no lingering questions in the readers' minds as to what happens next. This is effectively achieved by incorporating the geese, hibiscus, and her driver's test into the last paragraph, tying up all the loose ends. Next, this last paragraph adds a strong theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the driver's test again through vivid memories of Vietnam. Lastly, it adds depth to the character. By saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not over - confident. These are some of the significant ways that the last paragraph enhances the story, providing a well - rounded and satisfying conclusion."
1141	10006	4	3	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng is gradually starting to adjust to her new home and that she possesses a tenacious spirit and will not give up easily. You can clearly tell that she still deeply misses her homeland by her emotional reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, which serves as a poignant reminder of her roots. But also, it is evident that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she keenly recognizes the geese and will make a well - thought - out decision on when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns, indicating her increasing connection with the new environment.
1142	10007	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not fully prepared for this test, mainly because she was not yet accustomed to the new place. However, after seeing the plants that vividly reminded her of home, and knowing that springtime is when more of these familiar plants will blossom, giving her a sense of comfort and connection, she will be well - equipped and ready to take the test over.
1143	10008	4	3	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to clearly state that the season of the flowers is over and should be held off until the spring. This gives the author a natural and well - defined point where he/she can end the current story and smoothly begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring. In conclusion, this is precisely why the author ends the story with this carefully chosen paragraph.
1144	10009	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". This is done to vividly show that Saeng is firmly going to take the test again and is not going to give up in the face of failure. This determination is clearly shown by her resolute statement, ""then I will take that test again"", which makes it evident that she has not lost hope and wants to try again with renewed vigor."
1145	10010	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of how it closely relates to when Saeng failed her driving test. Despite the setback, she was determined to take it over when she feels she's truly ready. The paragraph states ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again"", which beautifully captures her patient and determined approach, waiting for the right time to make another attempt."
1146	10011	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” which was written by Minfong Ho, certain elements keep the readers engaged. I believe she included those aspects because they keep you asking questions throughout the narrative. I think that since her mom was so disappointed with her, perhaps she can change things and make the situation better. In this way, the story offers a glimmer of hope and a chance for growth.
1147	10012	4	3	The author ends the story by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She chooses to end like this to clearly show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home, her mother “noticed the tear stain on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.” This indicates that Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story. However, by the end, she felt happy and optimistic, which is a significant transformation that the ending effectively conveys.
1148	10013	4	3	I think the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up easily. She was crying in the store and was just very depressed at that moment. But, deep down, she knows that she has to keep going forward. This shows a strong sense of determination within her. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her gradually getting used to her new environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her home country and what she now knows of the new country and skillfully puts them together. That way she gets hope from both aspects. For example, in the article it says “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become… almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is realizing that she is getting used to the current arrangement. So she then gets hope from this new - found familiarity. Also, I think the author did that so that it would add a positive and uplifting effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph, to leave the readers with a sense of hope and progress.
1149	10014	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or the people in the story have a deep appreciation for nature. They seem to like writing about nature, such as what’s in nature and its changes. Maybe this story is about nature at its best, capturing the essence of the natural world and how it can influence the characters and the overall mood of the story. Through this conclusion, the author emphasizes the significance of nature in the narrative.
1150	10015	4	3	The author wrote that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is vividly reminded of her old country and feels a deep sadness. The author writes, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng then buys the flower and has a heartfelt talk with her mum about it at home. The flower not only reminds her of home but also gives her a powerful inspiration. That is why she firmly says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom, showing her new - found determination and hope.
1151	10016	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits seamlessly along with a great deal of the story and sums it up quite well. In the story, the hibiscus holds a profound significance for Saeng. During the course of the narrative, she associates numerous memories with the hibiscus. It vividly reminds her of her home and her past, so it plays a truly important role. When she is planting it, it's winter and the hibiscus hasn't bloomed yet. So, by stating that she will take the test again when it is budding is akin to saying she will take the test again when it starts budding anew. She is essentially acting in the same way as the flower, once again highlighting its importance. And that's precisely why I think the author ended with that paragraph.
1152	10017	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly conveys that she can't work in the garden during winter, but phrases like “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding” are all distinct signs of spring. In the spring season, she will take the test again, which implies that she will also engage in working in the garden. This conclusion effectively ties together the elements of nature's cycle and the character's plans, making it a fitting end to the story.
1153	10018	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because the Author (Minfong Ho) is clearly telling you what will take place in spring time. I believe this as the text says Saeng vowed silently to herself, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This means that in spring the hibiscus will reach its budding stage, symbolizing new beginnings and a fresh start for Saeng as she prepares to take the test once more.
1154	10019	4	3	Because she thinks she will perform better in the spring for some reason. I'm not entirely sure if it's because she will be in a more positive mood then and the surroundings will look more reminiscent of her home place. Perhaps the warmer weather and the blossoming nature will create a more conducive environment for her to focus and do well on the test, giving her the confidence she needs to succeed.
1155	10020	4	3	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph because it powerfully symbolizes Saeng's firm decision to try again. Things in nature are indeed repetitive; seasons change, but eventually, they come around again. Geese migrate, but they too return. The author skillfully used this as a comparison to Saeng's decision to attempt for her license once more. Just like Saeng, the winter hibiscus was out of its normal environment but was gradually learning to adapt. This inspired Saeng to keep persevering even if she failed because the hibiscus was bravely trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place. This conclusion effectively encapsulates the theme of resilience and hope in the face of adversity.
1156	10021	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because no matter what she said or did, she had to get the flower because it reminds her of where she used to live and what it was like there. So, she started to cry. The test was not to buy the flower and not to cry. And she decided that in the spring, she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.
1157	10022	4	3	She checks to see if her plant will survive the winter, just like the ones back at home. She hopes that things will turn out the same way as they did in her previous home. This small hope gives her a bit of comfort in the new place.
1158	10023	4	3	It's the start of a new life. She has a new school and a new plant. It seems like she has a deep connection to the plant. As it grows, she grows stronger and more confident. That's when she said that when they come back and the hibiscus is budding, she will be ready for that test, fully prepared to face whatever it brings.
1159	10024	4	3	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won't give up and that she will give her new country a real chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what difficulties she might encounter. That she will be there, in that spot, patiently waiting to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.
1160	10025	4	3	Throughout this story, we are given background information on a girl who desperately misses her true home. When we are first introduced to young Saeng, she is in a florist's shop simply looking at flowers. We soon learn that she is not only looking at flowers but also looking at pieces of her home and past. She then purchases a hibiscus, which is a flower native to her Vietnam. After discovering that she has just failed a test, it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that statement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past. In the spring, Saeng will have a new home and find strength in her past experiences. That is what I feel the final paragraph suggests.
1161	10026	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, Saeng is firmly determined to pass the test. She clearly knows that when spring arrives and the hibiscus starts budding, she will retake the test. I think she wants to retake the test because the sight of the hibiscus vividly makes her think about her homeland. It gives her a strong sense of comfort and makes her feel more confident. She firmly believes she can pass it next time. The hibiscus makes her heart filled with happiness and a bit overwhelmed. With this new - found motivation, she wholeheartedly wants to retake the test. She's absolutely sure she will do better next time, as the hibiscus has become a symbol of hope for her.
1162	10027	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it clearly shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and smoothly go through natural changes, then so can she. To me, the flower is a powerful symbol to the author that strongly encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and painstakingly do it again. It's just that this time you will clearly know and would have thoroughly learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower beautifully blooms one spring, it sadly dies in the winter and then cheerfully comes again in the spring. That's exactly the same as Saeng failing that test that year; she can bravely go back next time and take it again, armed with the lessons from the past.
1163	10028	4	3	"Guess that she is saying that when winter is completely gone she will be well - prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were clearly not prepared for the winter to suddenly come as they were busy planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, laboriously digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."" That's the obvious reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter. So, she's likely waiting for the right time to be fully ready for the test."
1164	10029	4	3	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would deeply feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this extremely hard time. It makes the reader truly feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can constantly think of to make herself feel better is her beloved home town and how she was unfortunately taken away from it. This connection to her hometown shows her longing and pain, and the author's conclusion helps the readers empathize with her difficult situation.
1165	10030	4	3	He concludes the story because he wants another chance to retake the test. Maybe he didn't perform well the first time, and ending the story this way gives him the hope of a new attempt. He believes that with another opportunity, he can do better and achieve a more satisfactory result. This conclusion leaves the door open for him to prove himself in the test.
1166	10031	4	3	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this particular paragraph to strongly emphasize a new life and fresh chances for the main character. The future - setting of the paragraph, which is spring, vividly symbolizes rebirth and another start from the cold, harsh winter. The author takes this symbolism to heart, including more small events that enhance this symbolized meaning. The author has used a structured choice to convey her thoughts. When recreating the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like ""the geese return"" and ""take the test again"" which add to the importance at home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" clearly represents rebirth. In winter, the plant is dormant and less colorful, but in the spring, the plant shows rebirth through the vibrant color in its buds. By ending with this paragraph, the author effectively conveys the theme of rebirth, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
1167	10032	4	3	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it tells the tale of a young girl who has just moved to a new country and is having a tough time adapting to the new land and its people. However, I think the author put that specific quote at the end to lead the readers to believe that one should never give up, that there is always a new beginning and that they will make it through. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought were strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.” This shows that she has finally found comfort and is feeling confident, much like the geese that go to adapt in a new area and then will come back. Just as the winter hibiscus never gives up and keeps living in the new weather conditions every season, Saeng too will persevere in her new environment.
1168	10033	4	3	She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph. Specifically, she says a whole thing which implies that she will look forward to it when the winter is finally done. She will be in a position to retake the test again in the spring. This act of retaking the test is what she was essentially writing about in that part of the text, showing her hope for a better outcome in the future.
1169	10034	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that she is trying to adapt to her new surroundings. The hibiscus plant, with its unique charm, reminds her of her old life and provides her with a sense of comfort. So, when she takes her test in the spring, she will feel better and more at ease as she remembers her old life in this new place. In the story, it is mentioned that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that brought back memories of her old life. The plant, with its familiar essence, brought back warm memories of her old life and that helped soothe her. The spring season reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are in full bloom, the geese return to their usual spots, and the snow has melted away. With the comfort of her memories of her old life, Saeng feels like she can successfully adapt to her new surroundings.
1170	10035	4	3	The author chose this paragraph because it fits perfectly, just like a well - crafted conclusion. For example, the word “again” in the paragraph has a significant meaning. It implies that you did something already and it's over, but you miss it so you retry what you miss. In this paragraph, it's talking about nature and how it seems to want to “test” itself again. The use of “again” makes the paragraph resonate with the idea of repetition and renewal in nature, making it an ideal choice for concluding the story.
1171	10036	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it clearly still shows how unwaveringly determined Saeng is to take the test again and pass it successfully this time. By ending this story with the paragraph, the author is creating suspense, which is probably intended for a sequel of another story, leaving the readers eager to find out what happens next.
1172	10037	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl originally from Vietnam moves to @LOCATION1 and unfortunately fails the driver's test. Afterward, she decides to spend her money on a winter hibiscus to vividly remind her of her homeland. The ending paragraph, ""When Troy comes back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" shows a deep - seated feeling towards nature. She feels that just as the geese are ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud, so will she be ready, and she will take the driver's test again with renewed determination."
1173	10038	4	3	"She is talking about the flowers, and when she says ""test,"" I think she means how she closely looks at and examines the flowers and watches the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is someone who greatly admires flowers a lot, or maybe just this one particular hibiscus and how it buds. Maybe she is just someone who likes to see the natural changes that occur in the world around her."
1174	10039	4	3	I believe the author adds this passage to the story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2, she is determined and whole - heartedly willing to try and adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many difficult ways for her, the spring will bring forgiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further integrate herself into American @CAPS1, while the blooming of the hibiscus will bring her a sense of @CAPS4 to home, making her feel more at ease.
1175	10040	4	3	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to clearly show that Saeng has finally realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a positive and hopeful note. Also, the author artfully wraps things familiar to Saeng, and things native to her new home, into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed extremely upset and completely lost in this country, and she missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to start feeling better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does an excellent job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one coherent and satisfying whole."
1176	10041	4	3	She was eager to learn and take on more things. She was completely captivated by the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother carefully selected the plant, then they went home. Once there, they started planting it together. The daughter cherished the plant deeply. And she said with determination that next year she'd grow a plant as wonderful as the one her mom was growing.
1177	10042	4	3	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how much Saeng has grown up now since it no longer seems like she lives with her mom. To the author, it's likely that they want to emphasize to the reader the independence of Saeng. Now that she probably has left, as she doesn't live with her mom anymore, what has happened was just her past and will remain a memorable part of Saeng's life.
1178	10043	4	3	The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adapt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light touch of her grandmother’s long gray hair.” This indicates that Saeng was seeking things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also demonstrates how much she missed her homeland. “She failed the test that Saeng paid for.” This shows the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. At the end of the story, she said that “I will take the test again.” Seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leave, knowing that they will return, gives Saeng hope. The last part of the story shows that she will always remember her homeland.
1179	10044	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly show that despite the challenges, Saeng isn't going to give up and will keep striving forward.
1180	10045	4	3	With the hibiscus around her, Saeng will gain more courage and also have had more time to adjust to their new home. For Saeng, the hibiscus serves as a powerful motivation and it also vividly reminds her of her old homeland. The reason I think the author chose to end the story with this particular comment is to show that in the end, Saeng has found the courage and is fully ready to embrace her tasks in this foreign land.
1181	10046	4	3	The story concludes that paragraph because it tells you that there are changes in the weather and season, just as there are in your life. You have to sometimes deal with these changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand herself. There are changes in the weather all the time, like in the spring and fall. You just have to get over them and move forward.
1182	10047	4	3	In the story “The Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the writer ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph as she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng has not given up on her driver's test. “... Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This explains in more detail when she will take the test again. Another reason is that it leaves the reader to think about how the rest of the story will unfold and what Saeng's future might hold.
1183	10048	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” was a great way to end it because I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can endure, and then she realizes she can take just about anything, mainly the test. Also, when her mother said “You what?” and “Her mother stared at her incredulously,” she might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad, then she would overcome being upset about the test and be ready to face it again.
1184	10049	4	3	The writer adds this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the seasons are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you to know that when the season changes back, the flower will try to fit in again with the other flowers. That's what the author means when he talks about taking the test again. It implies that just like the flower adapts to the changing seasons, one should adapt to life's challenges and try again.
1185	10050	4	3	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is overcome by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in their new location. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says “when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.” The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on, leaving the readers with a positive feeling about Saeng's future.
1186	10051	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it conveys the message that if you fail the first time, there is always a second chance. Just like the @CAPS1 plant that dies in the winter and comes back alive in the spring, one can always bounce back from failure.
1187	10052	4	3	The author leaves us at the end of the story saying “when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author does this because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that reminded her of her home. She was happy, although the plants were not exactly like the ones from home. However, she got used to them. The flower @MONTH1 may not be the same, but it’s an @CAPS1 flower and she is getting used to being in @LOCATION1. When she goes back to take the test, she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will be full of life, symbolizing her new - found resilience.
1188	10053	4	3	I think the author ends the story like this because of Saeng's deep respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a symbol of her home but also as a symbol of good luck. In the text, she holds the plant in very high regard, having paid @NUM1 coins for it. So, I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing vigorously, which represents her own readiness and good fortune.
1189	10054	4	3	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For Saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1. The geese show her that she is, even now, adapting to her new homeland as the geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty, but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is more resilient and can withstand the snow, which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For Saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to clearly connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles and starting afresh.
1190	10055	4	3	The author chose to conclude the story like that because she’s saying that it isn’t over and she’s going to take the test again. In the story, Saeng says “I - I failed the test” so she’s determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right. This conclusion shows her perseverance and the hope for a better outcome in the future.
1191	10056	4	3	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the lovely spring when the colorful flowers are in full bloom because the pleasant scenery will make her feel more relaxed. The sight and fragrance of the flowers put the author in a calm and relaxed state of mind where she can better focus on the test. This way, she is more likely to perform well and pass the driving test.
1192	10057	4	3	Because she is saying that when the beautiful @CAPS1 grow back vibrantly, she will be mentally and emotionally ready as @CAPS2 to take the test again. The return of @CAPS1 symbolizes a new beginning and a positive change, giving her the confidence and motivation to face the test once more.
1193	10058	4	3	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because it is clearly showing everyone that the season is over for the growing of the plants. However, when it comes time for the delicate flowers to start growing again in the gentle warmth of spring, she will be back with dedication to take care of the plants. This is because they are her favorite and they are what she lives for now that she has committed to taking care of them. Also, the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to pique people's interest in reading more of the story later on. It leaves readers in a sense of suspense, as you don't know if she really will go back to the plants or just think about them. Another reason I think the author ended it that way is that it is still snowing outside. She cares deeply about the plants, but she isn't going to worry about them until it is the right time again. For example, she says “when they come back then I will take the test again”. That's showing she is not giving up on anything she loves and she will keep trying until she succeeds.
1194	10059	4	3	In the story “the Winter Hibiscus”, I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the vivid memories of her old country would always be deeply ingrained with her, she will gradually and steadily adapt to her new one. Also, from time to time, she still will visit her old country with a mix of nostalgia and fondness. For example, “when the snow melts and the geese return”, it represents a change of season and a new beginning. The last sentences, “then I will take the test again”. This sentence means that once she is well - adapted to this country and goes back to her old one, she still will enjoy being there either way, as both places hold a special place in her heart.
1195	10060	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to retake the test over when all these wonderful things happen. When the snow melts gently, the geese return gracefully, and the hibiscus starts budding beautifully, it sets a perfect backdrop for her to face the test again. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up easily, and that she is going to keep trying with determination. The hibiscus is a precious lucky charm to her, which she keeps close during the test to inspire and strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also concludes the story with this paragraph to reveal Saeng's personal thoughts clearly and how she feels passionately about this test. In the spring, when nature undergoes a renewal, it is a clear indication that it is time to give the test another honest try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a strong indication that Saeng is never going to forget her dreams and the significance of the test, and she will always hold onto the hope of success.
1196	10061	4	3	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph of the story. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, when the snows gradually melt, the geese gracefully return, and this hibiscus is gently budding, she will take that test again.
1197	10062	4	3	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unite us all together in a meaningful way.
1198	10063	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus”, the author concludes with Saeng saying “I will take that test, again”. It means that Saeng will be fully ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all vibrantly in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was certain that as soon as the winter passes with the gentle coming of spring, she is sure that taking the driver's test again will be easier to overcome the fear and the grieving times in this new place. This clearly means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also firmly sure that the warm memories of her homeland will help her, too. In the end, it's revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fully fulfilled in her new homeland.
1199	10064	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it vividly shows her determination. In the spring, it will be quite hard for the hibiscus to survive because it's a winter hibiscus and it also displays remarkable determination.
1200	10065	4	3	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was truly ready to bravely face her obstacles again. Also, it shows that she was sincerely appreciating her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased, her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. It's clearly telling Saeng that if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe she can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng realized that things had a repeating season upon season, she must have realized that she can do it too, and face the driving test again with newfound courage.
1201	10066	4	3	"The author, MiNfoNg Ho, concluded the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the Spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This is because when the plant begins to blossom, she will feel more confident and comfortable. Throughout the story, one can see how she's trying to adapt to new surroundings. I believe that the hibiscus represents comfort at times of disappointment and a connection to her past experiences. Since the hibiscus offers this comfort during disappointing moments, it's the reason she went out and purchased the plant. So, when spring comes again and the hibiscus is fully bloomed, that's why she'll take the test again as she will feel more at ease in and with her surroundings. That is why the author, MiNfoNg Ho, concluded the story the way he did, leaving a message of hope and resilience."
1202	10067	4	3	The past experiences of our lives often influence various aspects of our daily existence, whether we consciously recognize it or not. In this story, Saeng attempts to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the certain flower that reminds her of her home. Unfortunately, she fails. She is grappling with the fact that she is no longer “at home,” where the familiar things and people that once grounded her are no longer present. However, there are new elements in her life that she is gradually getting used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph he did to show that change is always possible. She is trying to push the things that trigger her longing further back in her mind. With time, perhaps even by next year, she can achieve this. It is always possible to accomplish something if one truly desires it, and the author is demonstrating that Saeng really wants to pass her own mental test so she can better adapt to the changes. When she does, her mother will be proud of her, highlighting the theme of growth and resilience in the face of change.
1203	10068	4	3	I think that she was expressing in that way to say, “Hey, I didn't overcome something this time, but I'll be back next year to take the test again.” Just like the hibiscus buds when the snow melts and the geese return the following year, she sees the cycle of nature as a symbol of renewal and second chances. This shows her determination and hope for a better outcome in the future. It's a powerful message of perseverance and the belief that setbacks are only temporary.
1204	10069	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again. By ending the story this way, the author emphasizes Saeng's determination and resilience. It gives the readers a sense of hope that despite the current setback, Saeng is not giving up. Instead, she is ready to face the challenge once more, which also serves as an inspiration for the readers to persevere in their own lives when faced with difficulties.
1205	10070	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again.
1206	10071	4	3	When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year, she specifically means trying to plant the plants all over again from scratch. When Saeng says “Here, let me help, mother,” right then you can clearly know that Saeng does genuinely want to help with the plants after all.
1207	10072	4	3	The author's choice of the last paragraph in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus,” vividly shows the hope for the future that Saeng feels. The winter and cold precisely represent how she feels out of place and deeply upset at not receiving her driver’s license. In the spring, she will have a beautiful piece of her homeland blooming, and she will feel warm again both physically and emotionally. She will feel fully ready to take her test again “when they came back.” This clearly shows her adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her precious memories. The last paragraph effectively proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move forward with a new sense of purpose.
1208	10073	4	3	The speaker @MONTH1 concludes the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 significantly help her boost her confidence. She sincerely wants to feel like she has the ability to do this test and succeed.
1209	10074	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She realizes that she has another real chance to pass the test. When the spring blossoms again, she begins to garden with renewed hope. When the spring returns, she knows she can face the test with a more positive attitude.
1210	10075	4	3	Saeng finds deep comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything around her was completely unfamiliar to her, so unfortunately, she failed. But on her way back, something familiar unexpectedly found her, the native plants of her home. “There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood - red blossom,” “floating in the bucket.” Saeng truly needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, this clearly symbolizes change. “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.” Spring is indeed a time for new beginnings, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” When the familiar object is at its most vibrant best, she will be at her best too and be able to bravely face anything. Winter is the “getting - ready” stage where she prepares herself mentally and emotionally for the challenges ahead.
1211	10076	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower right after she failed the test. So, when the flower blooms, symbolizing new growth and a fresh start, she will take the test again, hoping for a better outcome.
1212	10077	4	3	I'll think the author tried to say that when it's coming to the time of snow melt, like in @MONTH1, then she will come back. The author will do so because in the spring season, at some point, she plans to write a new book, perhaps inspired by the renewal and fresh beginnings that spring represents.
1213	10078	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a powerful symbol of Saeng’s future. Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of Saeng for many reasons. For one, both Saeng and the plant are originally from Vietnam, and both have to struggle to survive and thrive in the new and unfamiliar world of the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, showing signs of growth and resilience, so shall she by retaking her driver’s test. This symbol of a hopeful future is extremely important to the story’s theme and message. This is why Ming Fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol, leaving the readers with a sense of optimism and the idea of new beginnings.
1214	10079	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader better understand the underlying message. The message of this story is that no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. By making this the last paragraph, the author encourages the reader to think deeply and ponder upon what this determination and perseverance truly mean in their own lives.
1215	10080	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one key reason. That reason is because Saeng believes she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. When she brought it home, she felt a deep sense of disappointment. For example, she said “I failed,” clearly referring to the plant. She also makes comparisons between where she is now and where she used to live. For instance, she said “it’s not like the one at home,” highlighting the differences and her longing for the familiarity of her past. That’s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, to emphasize Saeng’s emotions and the connection between the plant and her experiences.
1216	10081	4	3	“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the gentle spring when the heavy snows gradually melt and the elegant geese gracefully return and this delicate hibiscus is just budding, then I will take that test again.” There are multiple connections of this statement with the story. First of all, she adores being in the charming garden, and, as the rules go, one is not allowed to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all, she has a deep - seated love for plants and all things similar to plants. That’s precisely why the author concluded the paragraph to the story. When spring arrives, Saeng is eager to purchase various plants and colorful flowers. Last of all, Saeng spots a familiar plant. Later, she heads to a well - stocked florist shop to check if it can be purchased. She gets extremely upset when something goes awry with them, but this doesn't dampen her spirit for the upcoming test.
1217	10082	4	3	In the text, when the mother tenderly said, “It’s flowers aren’t as showy, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold, harsh months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This simple yet profound sentence clearly shows that Saeng is just like these resilient flowers. They are tough enough to endure the biting winter, and when spring arrives, they reveal their true beauty, being both very pretty and strong. This emphasizes that Saeng will also grow stronger and become more confident in the warmth of spring. That’s exactly why the author placed this statement at the end. It is a perfect reflection of the flower's journey, just as they display their charm and strength in spring, Saeng too will shine in her own way.
1218	10083	4	3	In the short story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author includes a poignant paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho includes this paragraph to vividly show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is newly arrived in the United States; she and her mother had left their homeland, Vietnam, and journeyed here. Throughout the story, she often slips into a state of reminiscence about her idyllic home life in Vietnam. She fondly remembers her kind - hearted grandmother and the vibrant flowers that bloomed there. “Where was me...hibiscus hedge?... Her gentle grandmother?” When at the bustling flower shop, Saeng's eyes light up as she finds an hibiscus, a flower they also cherished in Vietnam. She observes how it has adapted to survive the cold winter here. As she carefully plants the flower in her backyard, with dirt on her hands and hope in her heart, she makes a solemn promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, yearns to become well - adapted to the new environment and be able to live here without constantly missing home. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show that Saeng, like the hibiscus, wants to adapt to her surroundings and finally pass the driving test.
1219	10084	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in numerous ways, but the most crucial one is that it represents change and growth and the remarkable ability to overcome obstacles. When she first sets her eyes on it, a flood of childhood memories and a wave of sentimentality wash over her. However, she realizes that if she wants to evolve as a person, she must adjust to her new home. She will persevere here, just as the hibiscus will weather through the long, cold winter. Also, Saeng firmly vows that “in the spring” when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is resolutely determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself is a powerful symbol of triumph over obstacles. It stands for survival and endurance through life’s many disappointments and challenges, from the setback of failing a driver’s test to the daunting task of starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author’s thoughtful choice to end the story with this paragraph clearly exhibits Saeng’s ultimate understanding of her inner strength through the powerful symbol of the hibiscus, leaving the readers with hope for her future.
1220	10085	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to convey an important message to the audience. The message that the author was striving to get across was that even though she didn't pass the test on this attempt, she was determined to try again next year. An excellent example of this unwavering determination is an exact quote: “in the spring when the snow slowly melts and the geese return in large flocks and the hibiscus is budding with new life, then I will take the test again.” The use of these vivid seasonal details not only sets a hopeful tone but also shows that Saeng is waiting for the right time to make a comeback. This is precisely why I think the author concludes the story in such an inspiring way, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for Saeng's journey ahead.
1221	10086	4	3	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her driver's test for the very first time when the hibiscus starts to bud, this budding hibiscus will represent a significant change in her life. Also, Saeng used to have beautiful hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam. So, when the flower buds in her new environment, it could clearly show that she has established a new home. This connection between the hibiscus and her life events adds depth to the story.
1222	10087	4	3	The author finished the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for this conclusion is that it is extremely important for Saeng to feel truly at home. When the hibiscus buds, it will vividly remind her of her home in Vietnam and this will greatly comfort her. When she feels at peace and at home, she will perform better on the test, thus showing her growth and resilience.
1223	10088	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to clearly show that she is not giving up on her new home nor forgetting her old one. She shows she is not giving up when she carefully brings home the flower to plant in her new place. That act also clearly shows she will not forget her old home in Vietnam. Also, when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” That statement shows she is giving her new home another sincere shot and is not giving up easily. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is gradually accepting the changes and giving her new home another fair chance. She is firmly not giving up on it, which is a positive sign of her adaptation.
1224	10089	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does so because she is fully ready to do the same enjoyable things next year. She truly likes spending quality time with her mom, she has a great fondness for plants, and she loves having a lot of fun with her mom. These are some of the clear - cut reasons why she concludes with that paragraph, as it reflects the positive experiences and relationships that are important to her.
1225	10090	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides deep - seated comfort. After Saeng failed her driving test and was new to a foreign place, she was extremely frustrated and was deeply missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus, with its lovely fragrance, reminded her of her dear grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it vividly reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed”. It brought her much - needed comfort in a time of great disappointment. Since she didn’t have her grandmother with her, the flower became a source of solace. Although she was disappointed, the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the native word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus, she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue”. The joy and comfort that the flower brings to Saeng are palpable. She will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding”, thus effectively bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they can truly feel what Saeng feels.
1226	10091	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it intricately relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her challenging situation in a new country. It clearly shows that Saeng is deeply using the hibiscus and its remarkable ability to adapt as a powerful source of inspiration. During the story, Saeng vividly describes how she had always fondly seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom gently describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she reassuringly says it’s because it’s strong and was able to bravely adapt to the cold, harsh winter environment of the United States. This is precisely what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have unfortunately failed her license test, but she astutely used the hibiscus actions to set a clear goal for herself. The plant will patiently go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will surely grow and beautifully blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to diligently study and get fully ready, and she’ll be confidently prepared for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on effectively shows the profound connection Saeng made with her own situation and the plant’s situation, highlighting her potential for growth and adaptation.
1227	10092	4	3	“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This well - known quote is commonly used by many caring parents trying to warmly encourage their children or by dedicated coaches to strongly motivate their team. The quote can also very aptly apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng disappointingly fails her driver's test and, when slowly walking home after the test, she attentively notices a hibiscus flower which sweetly reminds her of her far - away homeland. Deep sadness completely encompasses her and she decides to purchase the plant to gently pacify her intense grief. She carefully brings it home and is at first mildly reprimanded by her mother but then sincerely thanked for buying it. While Saeng is tenderly planting the hibiscus, she clearly hears the honk of Canada geese which had gradually become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote effectively shows the difficult adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to clearly show that like the hibiscus flower, she will bravely adapt to the tough terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to firmly push forward and try again for her license as the plant valiantly pushed forward through the harsh winter.
1228	10093	4	3	The author ends the story this way because Saeng deeply feels a strong sense of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower vividly reminds her of her beloved homeland with her dear grandmother. According to the story “the familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost tenderly feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair.” You can also clearly tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart wherever she goes. The text states that, “it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” She seems to be very closely connected with nature and all of its wonderful and desirable traits. When she failed the test, she bought her “@CAPS1 Malik” flower as a kind of gentle sense of comfort. They both decided to lovingly plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge, uplifting boost of confidence to retake the test, showing how the flower's presence can bring about positive change.
1229	10094	4	3	She compares the paragraph to the story to draw a parallel with school. The test in this comparison represents the challenging tasks of making new friends and performing well on the test and in classes. In the paragraph, it clearly said “Then I will take that test again.” This is the exact reason she is comparing that paragraph to school. By making this comparison, she is expressing her determination to face the difficulties in school, just as the person in the paragraph is determined to retake the test, highlighting the importance of perseverance in academic and social aspects.
1230	10095	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to strongly emphasize Saeng's unwavering determination to overcome the numerous obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng nervously taking a ‘test’. While reliving her precious memories in the greenhouse, she started to emotionally breakdown. “A wave of loss so deep and strong it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.” She then sadly buys the plant and takes it home to her mother, tearfully telling her that she ‘failed’. The mother then becomes understanding and gently helps Saeng vow to retake the ‘test’. The narrator effectively emphasizes Saeng’s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and bravely go on with the future, showing that she has the strength to move forward despite her setbacks.
1231	10096	4	3	Because her school work, specifically a botany - related assignment, was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a well - maintained green garden. And it is quite obvious she failed the test, perhaps due to insufficient knowledge about the local flora. So when spring starts to show its gentle signs, she will retake the test because the flowers will be in full bloom, and she can do more in - depth study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back these days so she can enjoy the colorful flowers and the presence of nature while growing her knowledge through studying.
1232	10097	4	3	I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng, a determined young girl, was not giving up. Saeng was originally from Vietnam, a country full of rich culture and beautiful landscapes, but she moved to the United States, a place with a very different environment. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same, from the food to the scenery. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at...”. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words “at home”. But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, with its new routines and customs, she decided that she was going to give the driver's test one more try. “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows her resilience and hope for a better future.
1233	10098	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to feel more comfortable when she saw the geese flying gracefully in the winter sky and plants the hibiscus, a symbol of her homeland, in the winter and carefully keeps it from dying. In the story it said, “... their faint banks clear and - yes - familiar to Saeng now”. I think this is vividly explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly overhead because she used to see that in Vietnam, a sight that brought back warm memories. Also, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, she gains more confidence because she feels like she’s back in Vietnam, surrounded by the familiar signs of nature. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, to show Saeng's emotional connection with nature and her journey of adaptation.
1234	10099	4	3	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imaginatively picture what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their creative imagination to deeply connect to the story on a personal level. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give a glimmer of hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time, as she has shown growth and determination throughout the story. It was also a way to end the story on a positive and heart - warming note, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about Saeng's future.
1235	10100	4	3	The author ended the story with that particular paragraph because like the geese that migrate and return, she will be back to try again. Just in case she didn't get to finish just about everything she wanted to do, such as passing the driver's test or fully adjusting to the new life. And the author wanted the reader to know the strong determination and unwavering ambition of the character in the story. Also to show the readers that the character's positive characteristics couldn't be beaten by one harsh winter and that she is going to keep going at it until she does what she has to do, which is a powerful message about perseverance.
1236	10101	4	3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations, a person can never give up and sink into despair, and that there are always things to comfort someone. In the story, glimpses of Saeng's home are given in her memories, and from them, the reader can clearly understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is carefully describing these warm, comforting memories to create a sharp contrast with the cold, bitter day the girl is experiencing. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.” Here, Saeng vividly recalls a memory of her grandmother, and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author gradually builds up Saeng's despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, “then I will take that test again,” you can truly feel her hope. Also, the author wants to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says, “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope, and to show that there are always things that can give you hope and security.
1237	10102	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author would like to neatly finish the last sentence of the story. Also, at the end of the paragraph, Saeng is visualizing and devoting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are sincerely appreciated towards the plant. The author wanted to add more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, as the winter passes and spring arrives, the plant comes back to life, which symbolizes that the character Saeng will regain her strength and visit it once again. In this way, the author uses this ending to convey a sense of renewal and hope.
1238	10103	4	3	The author made it seem like he did not like it, but in reality, he loved flowers and enjoyed working in the yard with the people. His mom is an important part of his life, and he liked to see her getting along well. He believed that things that had passed would come back because they truly liked the place. This shows that despite any initial appearances, there was a deep - seated affection for the environment and the people around him, and he had an optimistic view that positive things would return to this special place.
1239	10104	4	3	The author includes this at the end to show how much the character Saeng cares about the plant, and that the plant's scent has brought her back to her childhood. An example of her loving the plant is described as “that rich scent” (Paragraph Minfong Ho). Another example is “It felt smooth and cool” (paragraph Minfong Ho), which shows her close interaction with the plant. An example of the plant triggering childhood memories is that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten. When she comes back to the plant, it is as if she can relive those forgotten moments (paragraphs Minfong Ho). For these reasons, it is clear that the author adds this at the end to highlight the emotional connection between the character and the plant and the power of childhood memories.
1240	10105	4	3	I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read so it will be a powerful message. In the story, this girl has now moved to a totally new environment and a new culture. The only thing she was familiar with was a flower that grew wild where she used to live. This little vow to herself was a clear message to not give up. She should keep on going, and if she opens her mind to new things, who knows what she can experience and learn. So this girl didn't just give up easily. Her plant was like a beautiful representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts to grow anew, she decides that she will also start afresh. Also, it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new beginning because in the text, it says that change is inevitable but with hope, one can overcome difficulties and start anew. The girl's vow in relation to the plant serves as an inspiring reminder that there is always a chance for a fresh start in life, no matter how challenging the circumstances.
1241	10106	4	3	I think the author wrote that because maybe that's how she feels. In the winter, she could truly show people who she is. But when spring comes out, she's like a flower that has been dead all winter, unable to fully express her true self.
1242	10107	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the paragraph before, they were specifically talking about the “winter hibiscus” and the geese. So, the author simply writes another concluding paragraph that neatly wraps the story up. As a result, the reader walks away with a feel - good feeling, having a sense of closure.
1243	10108	4	3	In the story “The Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it vividly explains the numerous obstacles Saeng went through when coming to a different country. In this story, Saeng had just failed her driving test, and as she was looking at some tropical flowers, she was strongly reminded of her home. Moreover, the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it's the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This part of the story is very important because it carefully examines her growth and her hope for change, just as the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a beautiful blossomed flower. Furthermore, it clearly explains to the reader that she will not give up and that she will adapt to the environment just as the plant's life has changed and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, as it concludes Saeng's thoughts and hopes for the future while she is adapting to her new environment.
1244	10109	4	3	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reasons. I think the author wanted to give an interesting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows. For example, the author explains in detail how the hibiscus grows and the essential things that are needed for it to grow, like an adequate amount of sunlight, sufficient water, fertile soil, and proper waste management. Maybe the author figured that by explaining that when it snows, the growth process begins all over again, it would add a meaningful touch to the story's conclusion.
1245	10110	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng clearly said she failed the test. And she made a firm decision that when spring comes back, then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” However, she really does not tell us precisely what test she is supposed to be taking, leaving a bit of mystery for the reader.
1246	10111	4	3	The reason why she said she will wait until spring to take the test again is to see if she’s still preferring the bitter melon over the Big - Mac, which might reflect her long - term taste and lifestyle preferences.
1247	10112	4	3	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph because of this saying about taking the test again. What she means by this is that she will have to do the same thing next year, much like facing similar challenges and making necessary adjustments. She will have to adapt to life just like the hibiscus did, learning to thrive in different circumstances. She is also saying to do her best because everything in the world is about living to your fullest. So, it is indeed a good conclusion for the story as it ties in important life lessons.
1248	10113	4	3	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that is that it has an awe - inspiring ending. It leaves a strong impression on the readers. Also, it makes it clear that the story has a sense of openness, suggesting that they could make more, perhaps sequels or related stories.
1249	10114	4	3	What the author concludes is that in the springtime when the snows melt and the flowers come back, it creates a sense of the risk and beauty of springtime at home. The changing of the season from the cold of winter to the warmth of spring brings a certain unpredictability. Which makes her relax as she can enjoy the new beginning. Also, springtime is a more pretty time because all the flowers are out, and the particular flower that reminds her of home blessings adds a touch of nostalgia and comfort.
1250	10115	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng is going to wait to take the test when she knows that she will pass the test so she can get her license. Having a license is important to Saeng as she wants to drive anywhere she wants to go. So, she doesn't have to get her mom to take her everywhere she wants to go; she can take herself anywhere she desires. But she has to wait till the snows have melted before she takes her test again as she believes that the springtime will bring her the right state of mind and conditions for success.
1251	10116	4	3	The paragraph clearly shows that Saeng has a deep - seated and profound range of feelings for her plants. She genuinely takes pleasure in the presence of plants and whole - heartedly loves taking the time to be in the company of the plants, nurturing them and observing their growth. What she means in that last paragraph is that she is extremely eager for winter to pass so that her plants will start budding. Once that happens, she can once again fully enjoy the beauty and tranquility that her plants bring.
1252	10117	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively ties all the loose ends together, creating a cohesive narrative. I think that the author also uses it to convey the idea that in the spring, she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says ""Öin the spring, when the snows meltÖ."" I like that because it clearly explains what she desires and how she is determined, putting her whole mind into achieving her goal."
1253	10118	4	3	The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a clear goal for the cycle to start over anew. She skillfully uses geese as a well - known symbol for spring. When spring arrives, she would start preparing for this “test” once again with renewed vigor. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph serves as a powerful symbol of hope. It is, once again, a start of a new cycle as well as an object that brings back fond reminiscences in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and literary devices in order to effectively convey hope, evoke good memories, and signify a fresh start.
1254	10119	4	3	She would carefully grow some beautiful flowers in her garden and eagerly await the time when the geese come back to her pond. As the geese return, it would bring a sense of life and activity to the otherwise quiet pond area, creating a harmonious and peaceful scene.
1255	10120	4	3	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE PRIMARY REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO really bring out and emphasize the true meaning of the flower. ANOTHER IMPORTANT REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME IN A CLEAR AND CONCISE MANNER. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS “THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.”, IT'S SMARTLY RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN EFFICIENTLY RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEPING TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY, HELPING READERS FULLY GRASP THE UNDERLYING MESSAGE.
1256	10121	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus”, written by Minfong Ho, with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test, Saeng is disheartened. Then she finds the Hibiscus, and the memories of her homeland and her dear grandmother completely consume her. She decides to buy the plant and carefully puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng looks up and sees a flock of Canada geese gracefully fly overhead. Using her vivid memory of her old home and her loving family, and applying those warm feelings to her new surroundings, Saeng firmly vows to re - take the test, to give it another try. The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and will face challenges with renewed strength.
1257	10122	4	3	The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to whole - heartedly accept her new life. Once the geese return and the hibiscus starts to bloom, she feels as if she's truly at home. When she has that comforting feeling of being at home, she will be mentally and emotionally ready to take the test again. The text states “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. Clearly, the sight of the geese and the beautiful hibiscus vividly remind her of her home. Once she feels at home, she will feel completely at ease, free from the stress and anxiety. That's precisely why the author concluded with this passage, to emphasize Saeng's journey towards acceptance and self - confidence.
1258	10123	4	3	Why the author concluded with this paragraph was because it effectively restated the main idea of the story. By using this concluding paragraph, the key themes and messages of the story were clearly highlighted, allowing the readers to fully understand what the story was about. The author wrapped up the narrative in a way that tied all the loose ends together and made the story's essence crystal clear. That is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph, as it was a perfect way to end the tale and leave a lasting impression on the readers.
1259	10124	4	3	The author explains that she has failed the test. It is still the cold winter season, and the hibiscus is struggling to grow its lovely petals back. The plant looks a bit frail in the harsh winter weather. As she tells her mother, with a determined look in her eyes, “that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back”. This shows her connection between the growth of the hibiscus and her own readiness to face the test once more.
1260	10125	4	3	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of the events in the story and all the valuable lessons she learned about gardening from her mother, she clearly remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its budding. The memory of her mother's words is like a guiding light. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the pleasant spring time comes, with its warm sunshine and gentle breeze, then she is going to take that test again. The test will be a crucial moment that determines whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time. This ending neatly wraps up the story, showing her growth and the connection between nature and her personal development.
1261	10126	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because I guess her grandma passed away while the geese were in flight. Or perhaps that's precisely when the flowers start to gracefully bloom, creating a bittersweet connection to the loss.
1262	10127	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country with fondness. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country, yearning for the familiar sights and sounds. “It’s - it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. “I mean not like the kind we had at - at …” she found that she was still too shaky to say the words “at home,” and last, she burst into tears again. She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past that deep sense of longing. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. For Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back vivid memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on. “One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb.” The flower was too much of a precious memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold in her hands. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get used to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to whole - heartedly accept her new country and move on. Saeng decided the time between fall and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus with a mix of nostalgia and gratitude.
1263	10128	4	3	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginning of the story the girl failed the test. When she told her mother, she clearly saw that her mother was upset with the result. So after they planted the plant, she decided to take the test over, knowing that her mother would think the best of her effort. Also, it's in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test. And if you kept it out, people who read it would be like, “ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn't do anything about it.” Plus, when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did, as it adds an element of resolution and character development to the story.
1264	10129	4	3	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote in such a way that he could keep readers deeply interested so that they would be eager to read his other books. Also, with an ending of that sort, it kind of leaves room for further improvement and room for a sequel, allowing the readers' imaginations to continue the story in their own minds and creating an anticipation for more from the author.
1265	10130	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task her mother gives her. Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant, it is much too expensive. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn't cost that much!” Saeng becomes very upset and realizes with a heavy heart that she has failed her mother. However, Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. “Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.” This shows that even though she had failed, she wasn't going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home in a very profound way. It was very special to her, and she was determined to nurture it and see it thrive, just as she hoped to thrive in her new situation.
1266	10131	4	3	The Author concludes the paragraph because she wants to convey a specific message within the narrative. Throughout the text, certain themes and ideas have been presented, and by concluding with this paragraph, she ties up loose ends and summarizes the key points. This helps the reader to fully understand the overall meaning and purpose of the piece.
1267	10132	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows that the character in the story, Saeng, is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is deeply feeling homesick and has not yet adapted to her new surroundings. She is on her way home from her driver’s test, which she just failed. During this journey, she spots a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hibiscus is incredibly special to her because it vividly reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng, the hibiscus represents comfort in a time of disappointment, a strong connection to her past experiences, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng has not adjusted well to this change in her life, and it has affected her negatively. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obstacles in your life, but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome them. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and demonstrating to the reader that Saeng sees the hibiscus as her way of overcoming difficulties, and when she is ready and has adjusted, she will take her driving test again, determined to succeed.
1268	10133	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he’s saying that once the cold winter and the rejuvenating spring are over and the hibiscus is budding beautifully, then Saeng will start over again and bravely try once more. The author is indicating that Saeng can hardly wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden full of hope and new beginnings. This is precisely why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and the promise of a fresh start.
1269	10134	4	3	"This paragraph represents an action that Saeng is going to undertake over a time period of a year. She is going to gradually build up and transform herself in time for the retake of the test; it's like a symbolic rebirth in a way. The girl sincerely wants to be a whole new person when the test comes up again. Her mom seems to be constantly bothered by every action or choice of her daughter. Saeng suddenly realizes the significance of the hibiscus and why it goes through its cycle of dying and rebirth. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She closely relates the flower and the geese to herself. Over the year, the flower goes through distinct phases, dying and then being reborn. Saeng wants to get better once she goes through a similar phase like the flower. Just like the flower that opens up to be beautiful again, Saeng hopes to emerge stronger and more capable after her own period of growth and change."
1270	10135	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that when Saeng comes back from taking the driver's test on the way home, she sees a winter hibiscus that is so strikingly beautiful. Then she goes to the store and buys that flower, and it costs a significant amount of money. When she gets home, her mom is busy planting vegetables, and her mom asks her what that is. So she tells the truth, and when her mom knows that the flower costs a lot of money, she gets very mad at Saeng's extravagance. How could she do that? Saeng makes a big decision that she is going to keep the flower even though her mom is mad. I guess she loves that flower because it vividly reminds her of her time in Vietnam. The author puts this paragraph, I think, because when the geese return and the flowers are in full growth, she will take the test again. When she bought the flower, no blossoms had come out yet, so when it finally blooms, she will go again. This is to let her know that you need to see the first signs of progress and wait until it fully develops before you can take on a challenge again. In my opinion, that is a good ending, and it also poses a thought - provoking question too.
1271	10136	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a fitting conclusion. That passage means that once Saeng has properly adjusted to her new life in a new country, she will try taking her driver's test again. Once she can find a sense of familiarity in her new surroundings, she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detachment from Vietnam makes her feel isolated. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, as described by ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more sources of comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese, indicating her gradual adaptation to the new environment."
1272	10137	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the “snow does melt and the Geese return,” it will be an ideal time to plant and work in the garden even more intensively. This is because with snow covering the ground, planting is not possible. The return of the geese signals the appropriate time of the year to plant the seeds and aim for a more bountiful harvest. The test mentioned is to see if she can achieve a better grade than in the previous year and the year before that, demonstrating her desire for improvement and growth.
1273	10138	4	3	The author concluded his story with that paragraph because that is the most suitable way for it to end. The chosen ending aligns well with the overall narrative and themes presented in the story. It provides a natural and satisfying conclusion, which is why the author decided to end it in such a manner.
1274	10139	4	3	The author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She does this to show that now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just as she did in her homeland. In Vietnam, Saeng used to engage in a heart - warming tradition of brushing her grandmother's hair, helping put it into a bun, and placing a hibiscus in it. Another instance was when she used to get water from the well, and sometimes a hibiscus would come up with the bucket. These experiences made the hibiscus a significant comfort object for her. Now, as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use while also taking into account the natural cycles that repeat in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring, it is symbolizing that she is ready to start anew, just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng's own movement both signify change, but also a remembrance of old traditions, and create a space for new beginnings.
1275	10140	4	3	The author put that sentence in the story because she believes that setting the time as described will give her enough time to thoroughly prepare and get the test right. Additionally, she has a fondness for geese. The presence of the geese in the sentence not only adds a natural and seasonal element but also reflects her positive feelings towards these creatures, which may contribute to her motivation and sense of calm when thinking about taking the test.
1276	10141	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show the final determination and inner strength that Saeng has been given. It’s almost as though it’s taken this special plant to inspire her to get back up and bravely pass the Test. The plant becomes a comforting item that constantly reminds her of her beloved homeland. She returned with the plant to show her mother but found herself too emotionally shaky to even utter the words “at home”. This clearly shows how deeply she misses home. But she is gradually able to realize that this is her new home and everything is slowly becoming more familiar to her, marking her growth and adaptation.
1277	10142	4	3	She ends it with this sentence because it's a clear sign of new life. Just as the harsh winter that killed the plants and ended their life cycle, the gentle spring will surely come and start everything anew. This is precisely how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the precious memories were left behind. She feels out of place, much like the winter hibiscus struggling in the cold. But as the spring arrives, she'll feel like a brand - new person, fully ready and able to take on challenges. As she said here, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now”. She describes that with a new season comes new changes, and upon those changes, she will go on to take the drivers test again with renewed confidence.
1278	10143	4	3	The author ends with that paragraph for several well - thought - out reasons. One important reason is to show that although she has failed this time, numerous more opportunities will come later. Also, it clearly shows that even though difficult times befall her at present, good times are still on the horizon. For these valid reasons, it was a powerful and efficient way to end the story, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
1279	10144	4	3	The author uses symbolism to convey a different and profound message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is budding, and then she will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize that as Saeng gets older, just like the hibiscus going through its growth cycle, she will then be fully ready to take that test again. By using symbolism, the author can convey more of the story's essence and depth to the readers.
1280	10146	4	3	She wrote that response to tell everyone that she will be truly ready by the time when spring comes. Spring represents a time of renewal and growth for her. Then she will take the test with determination and pass it, achieving her goal and moving forward in her new life.
1281	10147	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng, whose life is deeply intertwined with the cycle of planting, wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng's entire life revolves around planting and the natural rhythms of the seasons. Saeng and her mother rely on what they plant for their food. So, throughout the growing season, they spend most of their time in the garden, carefully growing crops both to sell and to save. They save the produce for the harsh winter months and sell the surplus to acquire the equipment needed to continue their way of life. The part she's talking about in the paragraph that says “when they come back” is referring to the geese. She adores the sight of the geese flying over her head and gracefully landing in the yard on a beautiful day. When the snow melts, she yearns to get back down on her hands and knees in the soil to start planting again. Once the hibiscus starts budding, it's a sign that everything else will start growing. Saeng's life truly revolves around the planting season. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what Saeng wants to do more than anything, and it encapsulates the essence of her connection to the land and nature.
1282	10148	4	3	In the conclusion of the “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng notes how she will retake her driving test in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return. The spring season is when these natural events occur, along with the annual budding of the winter hibiscus. Her family had moved from Vietnam to a new location, [LOCATION2], and she had bought a winter hibiscus plant to remind her of her childhood in Vietnam. When the hibiscus blooms, she will retake her driving test because the blooming of the hibiscus will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in [LOCATION2], it represents a fresh start and a step forward in her journey of adaptation and integration.
1283	10149	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” a young girl named Saeng moves away from her familiar home environment. This short story depicts how the girl is trying to adapt to the new lifestyle and the numerous changes that come with moving to a new place. She has to adjust to different customs, a new climate, and new social dynamics. Despite the challenges, she is gradually learning to find her footing in this unfamiliar world, showing her resilience and determination to make this new place her home.
1284	10150	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants the reader to clearly see that Saeng will not stop until she passes her driver's test, much like the geese won't stop their long - distance migration until they reach the warm south for the winter. The author uses this comparison to emphasize Saeng's tenacity and determination. Through this, the author is trying to show the beauty of perseverance, of trying again and again, and of facing and overcoming the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving one's goal. In the end, it's a powerful message about the strength of the human spirit and the importance of not giving up.
1285	10151	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by [CAPS1] Ho, the author leaves the story off with a powerful ending. The ending was “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will try the test again”. Basically, the author concluded the story with that because it vividly shows that she's powerful, that she has the inner strength and determination to try and make herself stronger. It demonstrates that she's willing to face her fears and try again, and that she has the self - awareness to want to help herself grow and adapt. Text examples to prove this would be, “then I will take the hibiscus test again,” which clearly shows her resolve. “Almost Reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...” This shows her growing acceptance and adaptation. And “There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.” This line indicates her ability to appreciate the beauty in the new and unfamiliar. All those statements help backup why the author might leave such a powerful paragraph for last, as it sums up Saeng's character development and her hopeful outlook for the future.
1286	10152	4	3	"The author, in the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", concludes the story with the paragraph to vividly show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng was ""tested"" earlier in the story when she stepped into a florist. As soon as she entered, memories came rushing back to her like a flood. She tried hard to feel the same as she did long ago when her grandmother was by her side. However, she soon realized that the things in her memories were long gone, and overwhelmed by the sadness, she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test and then bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother, being very understanding, simply accepted it. Saeng planted the hibiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng is well - aware that seeing the flower again will make her cry and bring her memories back, and she will be retested, yet she still bravely awaits that moment."
1287	10154	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng failed her driver's test that day. Frustrated but determined, she vowed that she would retake it from the spring. She ends with this statement to clearly say that it is a new season and a brand - new beginning for her as she steps into her new life. This archetype of the changing from the harsh cold winter to the nice warm spring time symbolically shows that the troubles between her mother and Saeng would gradually get better. Just as the hard and troublesome winter gives way to a calm and warm new beginning in spring, Saeng firmly believes in this transformation. She knows this and is confident that she is going to pass the test when the time comes."
1288	10155	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for various well - thought - out reasons. For example, throughout the whole passage, it is evident that the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with the remarkable ability to overcome obstacles and offers her comfort in a time of disappointment. This ending paragraph shows that “in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,” and the world around her is once again beautiful, then Saeng will take her test again. She is certain that with the help of the hibiscus plant, she will pass the test. It clearly shows that her hope and trust to pass the test stem from the hibiscus flower. The plant with “waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers” will surely provide her the strength, determination, courage, and will - power to pass the test in the spring, giving her the edge she needs to succeed.
1289	10156	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends with the statement, “...then I'll take the test again.” This clearly shows that Saeng is willing to make an earnest attempt to adapt to this new place she lives in. What she refers to when she says “test” is her struggle to fit into the new environment. For example, in the story she said, “I - I failed the test,” when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent a significant amount of money on that plant, hoping to find a sense of home in her mind. But the reality was too much for her to handle at that time. She ends with the positive statement because it effectively sends the message that she looks forward to a bright future in her new home, ready to face whatever challenges come her way.
1290	10157	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many valid reasons. She skillfully puts in examples from the story that can help us find these reasons. One reason is that we can clearly know she won't give up. In the story, she says “Then I will take the test again.” This simple yet powerful statement tells us that she will keep trying and is highly determined to achieve her goal. Another reason is that she's trying to tell us that there is a promising future for the hibiscus. When she says “...and this hibiscus is budding,” it implies that the hibiscus has a chance to change and get used to its surroundings, just like the girl in the story will be doing. The last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best. When she says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange…, almost familiar to her now,” she is in the process of trying to get used to her surroundings and now realizes that she can. In the story, there are indeed many reasons to suspect why she ended the story with that paragraph. She gives examples in the story that make many readers draw various insights.
1291	10158	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with a firm determination. After the long, harsh winter finally ends and the hibiscus flower begins budding, she decides to pass the test. This shows a clear connection between the plant and the narrator, highlighting the hardships they both endure. The winter acts as a significant obstacle for the flower, yet it will persevere to thrive come spring. This gives the author the confidence that she too can overcome her hardships and flourish. Another shared hardship that she and the hibiscus both face is being ""root bound."" The author deeply misses her home of Vietnam. However, both of them must and will adapt to their new environments, finding a way to grow and be at peace in unfamiliar surroundings."
1292	10159	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it clearly shows that her longing for her home had a negative impact on her driving test. In her home country, the climate was warm, and she had cherished all her family memories in that comforting environment. In contrast, the new country she now resides in is cold and snowy, a climate she isn't accustomed to. The text states that she will take the test again when all those favorable conditions occur because it will then feel like her home country. This familiarity will allow her to be more focused on the test rather than being distracted by what she misses, increasing her chances of success.
1293	10160	4	3	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that specific paragraph to vividly show that Saeng is a tenacious person who would not give up easily. She is determined to pass the driving test and, in a sense, gradually get used to her new home. It serves as a powerful motivation, as Saeng says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The hibiscus flower acts as a source of motivation, bringing back memories of good - hearted people that made her happy and instilled self - belief in her. Minfong also concluded the story this way to convey that by next year, Saeng will start afresh. She will learn to become happy with her new life and not let her past hold her back. When Saeng says, “.. in the spring...”, it symbolizes the beginning of a new year, a time to start over and rejoice. This was truly a great way to end the story as it sets a positive and inspiring vibe. It makes the readers understand that Saeng is a strong - willed individual who can remember the past but bravely move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to emphasize that everyone should possess the strength to do the same.
1294	10161	4	3	She ended it with that paragraph because she wanted to firmly prove that even though she deeply misses the “old century,” she has the resilience to adapt and survive. The longing for the past is strong, but she realizes that life in the new place must go on. She understands that adapting is not an easy process, yet she is determined to face the challenges that come with it. By stating her resolve in the paragraph, she shows that she will find a way to make a new life for herself, leaving behind the sadness of the old while still cherishing the memories. In this way, she can build a future that is full of hope and possibility in the new environment.
1295	10162	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it exudes a strong sense of hopefulness. Initially, she was having a hard time adapting to her new home, which made her feel utterly hopeless. Saeng's failure in the driving test only added to her woes, making the situation seem even bleaker. To lift her spirits, she bought a hibiscus plant that instantly reminded her of her old home. She found great comfort in the plant, and it helped her get through the tough times. In the last paragraph, Saeng is eagerly looking forward to the arrival of spring. She plans to retake the test, hoping to pass it this time. This outlook provides a palpable feeling of hopefulness, which is precisely why the author concluded the story in this manner, leaving the readers with a positive and optimistic impression.
1296	10163	4	3	The author concludes the story with this well - crafted paragraph to clearly show that Saeng, a resilient character, will not give up easily and that there is still a glimmer of hope on the horizon. It is also a gentle yet powerful lesson for the reader to hold onto hope and exercise patience, understanding that good things take time to come to fruition. Saeng initially failed the test of not succumbing to the sorrows and misery of missing her homeland. She reflects, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This internal thought shows that she is gradually adjusting to her new environment. So, by ending the story with this and drawing a comparison to the geese, it vividly portrays that she is growing stronger with each passing day. She will undoubtedly take the test again because giving up is not in her nature, and she is determined to succeed.
1297	10164	4	3	Clearly, from reading the story “Winter @CAPS1”, the author strategically includes this poignant phrase “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” in the story. This is because the passage has a deep - seated connection to the title of the story “Winter @CAPS1”. The mention of spring, snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding after the winter alludes to the cycle of seasons and renewal, which ties in with the overall theme and mood of the story. It shows that despite the challenges faced in the “winter” of her life, Saeng is looking forward to a new beginning, much like the arrival of spring after winter.
1298	10165	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is quite evident. Even though Saeng didn't perform well on her last test, she has a burning determination within her. Saeng is resolute to go back and take the test again so that she can finally achieve a passing grade. The author skillfully showcases Saeng's unwavering determination to not only pass the test but also to do significantly better the next time around. This conclusion serves as an inspiration, highlighting that setbacks are only temporary and with perseverance, one can overcome them.
1299	10166	4	3	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is cleverly linking the plant, which stands for many positive attributes, to the character who failed the test that she really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant are shining examples of perseverance. The plant endures the harsh winter, showing remarkable resilience as it battles through the cold and snow. Similarly, the main character is not giving up on the test she desires to pass. The author is trying to send a powerful message to the reader: never abandon your goals and dreams. No matter how difficult the journey may seem, one should keep pushing forward. The plant acts as an emblem of hope and perseverance, and by associating it with the character, the author drives home the point that with determination, one can overcome any obstacle.
1300	10167	4	3	At the end of the story, the author says “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.” The author concludes the story with this because the character felt that she didn't give her best effort in the test and thus failed. The imagery of spring, with melting snows, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus, represents a new beginning and a fresh start. When the spring comes again, she is going to retry with renewed vigor and determination. Hopefully, this time around, she will be able to pass the test, as the new season symbolizes a chance for her to overcome her previous failure and achieve success.
1301	10168	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because she deeply desires to come back and conduct a smell test once again when the snow melts away and the geese gracefully return.
1302	10169	4	3	The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng. She is a young teenager, and her family has just moved to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng unfortunately failed her driving test. On the walk home, she discovers this incredibly beautiful plant named Hibiscus and immediately falls in love with it. Saeng's mother has a lovely garden where she is always busy planting things and uses the plants and veggies from her garden for dinner. The author concludes a paragraph that says when the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring, Saeng will take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she eagerly wants to see the beautiful plants when she passes the test, and she believes that seeing the Hibiscus will help her pass the driving test.
1303	10170	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself a glimmer of hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting, and it will give her the inner strength to take the test again and hopefully pass it, all because the winter hibiscus vividly reminded her of home.
1304	10171	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can clearly show that the hibiscus is the main reason why Saeng wants to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melts and the geese return, then she can, just like the hibiscus, be strong and won't give up on her test."
1305	10172	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng won't give up. It is indeed possible to adapt and try to love what's around you. Saeng struggled to get out ""I - I failed the test"" and couldn't say ""at home"", which clearly shows her insecurity and loneliness in the new world around her. By saying she will try again in the spring, it gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an experience today, comparing her old life to the one she is living in now, and they have some similarities. Because she will try again in the spring, it means she has decided to give this new place a real chance."
1306	10173	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says “Then I Will take that test again”. She firmly believes in the Flowers. Both she and the Flowers adapt to their circumstances. They are both determined to thrive in challenging places. They both manage to overcome various obstacles. Maybe she wants to see what lies ahead on her journey. She hopes she is right about the Flowers. Perhaps, she has a deep - seated fondness for the renewal and beauty that spring brings.
1307	10174	4	3	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It effectively and concisely summarizes the story, distilling its essence into just a few words. These words are so thought - provoking that they make you wonder what happened next and if there is a sequel to this engaging tale. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many aspects of my own life.
1308	10175	4	3	The reason why the author concludes this type of scenario is simply because the author has a pain to endure and cross over, or is in a particular situation. In this case, you might initially be confused, but if you look at it clearly, you'll open your eyes and see that it's your time to shine. You might as well seize this opportunity before you lose your chance. You only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people around you, so make it count.
1309	10176	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence because he is vividly showing the girl's confidence in herself. It also allows her sufficient time to thoroughly prepare for the next test. Moreover, she is certain that she will be fully ready when her flower begins to bud, which symbolizes her own growth and readiness for the challenges ahead.
1310	10177	4	3	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? It is so he can write another story. He has vowed silently and will write the story in the spring when the natural world comes back to life, bringing with it new inspiration and possibilities for his next narrative.
1311	10178	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was firmly stating that if it is indeed possible for these seemingly unlikely things to happen, then surely she should possess the ability to take the test and ultimately pass it. She was consciously comparing elements together that she clearly knew do not typically go together. For instance, she specifically said that in the springtime, when the snow gradually melts and the geese gracefully return and this particular hibiscus starts budding, then she would resolutely take the test over. What she truly meant was that if the thing she likes the most manages to overcome its significant obstacle, then she would have the courage to do what hurt her the most over again. She is uncertain that if she takes the test over, she might keep trying repeatedly over and over until she finally passes it. In the story, she struggles to know how to fit in. All she is familiar with is what she learned in her home country. All she has to do is exert a bit more effort and she maybe will be able to successfully pass this test.
1312	10179	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she tearfully told her mom that she had failed her test, the emotions were far more profound than just the disappointment of the failure. I strongly believe that she missed her home so intensely that it severely affected her ability to concentrate. She felt the need to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom become aware that she deeply misses home, as she might not want to worry her mother.
1313	10180	4	3	When they come back, Saeng silently and determinedly vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snows slowly melt away and the geese steadily return in their characteristic formation and this specific hibiscus begins to show delicate buds, then she will bravely take that test again. The author concludes the story as if oblivious to the biting cold, her mother was still patiently out in the vegetable garden, carefully digging up the last of the onions with a well - worn, rusty trowel, perhaps symbolizing the perseverance and routine in the face of changing circumstances.
1314	10181	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is vividly showing that the hibiscus deeply inspires her and offers a sense of comfort that no person could ever attempt to replicate. For example, after Saeng disappointedly failed her driver's test, she was extremely dejected. On her way back home, she unexpectedly saw a hibiscus and immediately went to a nearby florist shop to try and purchase it. Saeng gently took a single petal from the plant and tightly held it in her hand while she softly closed her eyes. The plant vividly reminded her of her real, beloved home in Vietnam. The hibiscus became a precious form of comfort for Saeng right after she had just failed her driver's test, even though the plant was not exactly the same as the ones at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will patiently wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it clearly shows that the hibiscus helps her to bravely overcome obstacles in life and it effectively helps her to endure the hardships she faces.
1315	10182	4	3	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that when it is the appropriate season for those specific plants, she will confidently take the test again. The test is designed to assess her understanding to begin to appreciate aspects like the plot. It involves getting to know the unique features and endearing characters about these plants. Also, it includes learning about the rich history related to these plants. By taking the test at the right time, she hopes to gain a deeper connection and knowledge about them.
1316	10183	4	3	She is firmly demanding to not take the test again if the winter hibiscus don't come back. She was extremely upset that she had failed the test. She spent most of her day intently looking at the hibiscus, but she was still disheartened that they weren't the real ones back at home. Her mother gently said they are strong enough to make it through the winter. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.
1317	10184	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the hope that things will gradually get better. The author ends with hope because the flower vividly symbolizes the girl, and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year, so can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is slowly realizing that it is going to take some time before she can fully adapt to her new country, but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be truly horrible, and that this statement ends the day on a genuinely good note. The girl spends the entire day longingly wishing that she were back in her own country and deeply missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl firmly vowing a promise to herself that she will bravely withstand the winter until spring, and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this significant turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and rather strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt.
1318	10185	4	3	The author concludes this story with this sentence because it clearly shows hope for the future. This sentence effectively lets readers know that times are tough now, but in due time things will surely get better. Saeng might have unfortunately failed this test, but she's not giving up hope on passing it. She firmly believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is just right. Saeng might deeply miss her home, but she won't let that interfere with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
1319	10186	4	3	What the author is talking about is that the snow was slowly melting and the spring is gently coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees, and grass are going back to being beautifully vibrant. Also, he was clearly letting us know that spring is here and that it is no longer winter. That's why she starts to carefully plant plants in the winter so that in the spring they can grow out to be nice and stunningly beautiful for the spring. That's what I think the author meant. Also, that's the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should have added more details like how the plants and such were growing so magnificently beautiful. He should add more details to clearly let us know what he was talking about in this paragraph.
1320	10187	4	3	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively and seamlessly ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home and the old, together in perfect harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which closely relates to the unwavering determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently and bravely through the winter. A great deal of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages subtly hidden within that final sentence. It implies that, though the past may be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can surely be conquered."
1321	10188	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they because it clearly shows Saeng's strong determination and her remarkable ability to overcome the obstacles of being new in a country. Right after her test, Saeng was filled with all sorts of doubts. However, it is truly a big deal for her to come to the conclusion of retaking the test. When she said, “Here, let me help you mother,” (HO), it demonstrated her new - found resolve. With her mom comforting her and telling her it is okay, it gives Saeng the much - needed boost. This support makes her think to herself that she can't let just one thing hold her back in life. With the support Saeng has, she will definitely pass the test the next time, showing her growth and strength in the new environment.
1322	10189	4	3	In the story “winter Hibiscus,” the author Minfong Ho ends with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She ends with this to vividly show her determination to do well in her new country and to illustrate that the memories of her grandmother help her to strive for the best in her new home. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is at a flower shop and sees all the familiar flowers of her home country growing in pots. At the sight of these flowers, a flood of memories comes back to her, memories that bring a mix of joy and sadness. Then when she returns home, she tells her mother that she failed the test. You can clearly tell from her actions that she is deeply disappointed. “I - I failed the test. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.” After a while, she carefully planted the flower in the vegetable garden. The act of buying and planting the flower shows that Saeng wants to hold onto the memories of her grandmother and home. Thinking about her grandmother helps her to persevere and makes her want to succeed in her new home. Memories of her grandmother make her sad but also, in a way, bring her a sense of comfort and happiness, which fuels her determination to do better.
1323	10190	4	3	The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories in a different way because it creates a sense of anticipation that makes the reader eager to go on to a sequel or the next story, and it really adds an interesting twist to the ending. Another reason an author would end like that is because they want the reader to engage their imagination and picture what happens next. Using this technique is effective because the reader already knows what has happened in the story so far, and it makes the reader wonder whether she fails or succeeds the next time around. This kind of ending leaves a lasting impression on the reader, making the story more memorable and thought - provoking.
1324	10191	4	3	The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it may not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can sense that although her mother is understanding, she has let her mother down a little bit. When her mother says, “But how could you? You know how much we… what happened?” Saeng clearly feels that she has disappointed her mother. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mother's slight inkling of disappointment, Saeng is even more motivated to try again. This shows her emotional growth and her strong desire to make her mother proud in the new environment.
1325	10192	4	3	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to clearly show that Saeng was a very determined person. Throughout the story, the author aimed to portray Saeng as a strong character as she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to emphasize that Saeng was not going to give up hope easily. Instead, she was going to take the test again, showing her resilience and unwavering spirit. This conclusion leaves the reader with a positive impression of Saeng, highlighting her ability to bounce back from setbacks and continue to strive for her goals.
1326	10193	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it allows you to gain a clear view of what she is saying. Moreover, it enables you to understand it from the situation she was in while growing up. For example, she mentioned certain things that provided context to her perspective.
1327	10194	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a poignant point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1, they were harshly told to forget where they were from. The word ""test"" in the story symbolizes getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng says those words because she failed the test and bought something that vividly reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion, the author is effectively describing how immigrants were treated and forcefully told to forget who they were because they are in @LOCATION1 now, highlighting the struggles they faced."
1328	10195	4	3	In the story “Winter @CAPS1”, the author was trying to convey that Saeng was from somewhere other than where she is now. In the text, it says “It was like walking into another world”, so she is there, thinking that nobody knows her except for herself alone. This sense of isolation emphasizes her situation as an outsider in a new place.
1329	10196	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because it shows clear signs of hope, knowing that spring will come again. For the family, this means that everything will be okay. The harshness of the current situation will pass, and better times are ahead. Also, the girl will make friends when spring comes, which will bring more joy and a sense of belonging to her life.
1330	10197	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng took her driver’s test and unfortunately failed it. She wants to try and take it again in the spring. I think she ends the story saying that because in the spring, the hibiscus plant that she got and planted with her mom will be growing and blooming beautifully. Also, the geese will be back, which makes her feel more at home. That way, she will feel comforted and be able to take the test and pass, as it will strongly remind her of being home and give her the confidence she needs.
1331	10198	4	3	In the end of the story, they clearly state that she will take the test over again. Specifically, it will be in the spring when the geese return from their winter flight. What they imply is that she will make a truly fresh start in the spring when the geese come back. So, she'll be starting all over again, a brand - new start to a new year. It's a new time to diligently study for the big test and time to regroup from the last test that she took and unfortunately failed. Her mom was in total disbelief when she found out that her daughter failed the test. But her mom gently said to her that it will be okay and she can take it over again in this new, promising season. With this new chance, she has the opportunity to prove herself and succeed.
1332	10199	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she is deeply thinking about what it will be like when all of this unfolds. Saeng made a silent vow to herself, saying, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is starting to bud, then I will take the test again.” This shows her determination and hope for a better outcome in the future.
1333	10200	4	3	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a truly good note and vividly show hope for the future. First, throughout the story, Saeng felt extremely lonely and deeply depressed because she sorely missed her home in Vietnam. Amidst all this depression, Saeng chanced upon the winter hibiscus that strongly reminded her of her cherished childhood memories. She then felt a glimmer of hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower beautifully represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it clearly shows the perseverance factor in the story. Saeng fails her driver's test and comes home feeling utterly unaccomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms, it powerfully shows her perseverance and unwavering determination of never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and present a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from, with love and perseverance, you can surely overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home, with a bit of hard work and faith, you can achieve your goals and find success.
1334	10201	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to clearly show that she will do this once she has fully gotten used to the change of her new country. When she says, “When the geese return,” the faint, gentle honks of the geese flying overhead have become familiar to her over season upon season. Also, when the hibiscus is budding, because this will vividly remind her of her home in Vietnam. Seeing the flower and hearing these geese will give her the much - needed confidence and strong encouragement to retake the driver's test and strive for success.
1335	10202	4	3	My detail about Saeng is that she vowed silently to herself because she had great difficulty making new friends. She has a special affinity for plants and likes to plant things around her as she genuinely feels like plants are her friends. Saeng took the shovel and carefully finished the planting for her mom. This simple act made Saeng feel extremely good about herself, giving her a sense of purpose and accomplishment in a world where she often felt alone.
1336	10203	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” decided to end the story with this paragraph because it's like a new beginning for Saeng. In the story, Saeng moves to a new place and unfortunately fails the test. The winter hibiscus, a precious reminder, comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her a glimmer of hope, even though in the winter it may not be as vibrant as it would be in the spring. Spring is well - known as a time for new beginnings because in the winter everything seems to die, only to come back to life in spring. Saeng feels that she would take the test as a chance for a fresh start. From my personal experience, I always engage in spring cleaning because I want to begin anew. Spring is filled with fresh air and gives me the inspiration to do well. This could very well be why Saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. Therefore, the author of “Winter Hibiscus” decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to vividly show how Saeng longed for a new beginning.
1337	10204	4	3	Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author concludes the paragraph by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that significant things will change come spring. For example, in the story the girl said “I - I failed the test.” By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test, come spring she has the opportunity to change. She can work hard, practice more, and get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, “The 'winter hibiscus' was in the ground now, and she tamped down the soil around it.” This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have transformed, changing color and blooming beautifully. In conclusion, authors end stories with a paragraph like this to clearly help show the positive changes that could happen in the future.
1338	10205	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The “budding hibiscus” symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to a new place, she couldn't take all her friends and possessions with her, but she could carry the memories. The flower, with its familiar essence, reminds her of home, which is especially comforting after she failed her driver's test. In addition, the “geese returning” symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers in spring, a time to start all over after a dreary winter. Finally, “...then I will take that test again.” This shows that one should never give up. Even though it was hard for her to adapt to a new country, she made friends and tried new foods, like a Big Mac. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to effectively show comfort, new beginnings, and the spirit of never giving up.
1339	10206	4	3	The reason why the author wanted to put that last paragraph down is because they want to keep the reader deeply interested in the story. Another reason why she put that in the story is that it is letting the reader know that the plant, a symbol in the story, will never give up. Just like the plant endures through various conditions, it represents perseverance. The author uses this to convey a powerful message to the readers, making them understand the importance of resilience. In conclusion, the inclusion of that last paragraph serves to both engage the readers and impart a valuable lesson about not giving up.
1340	10207	4	3	The author concludes the story with the quote, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that she is strongly encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were strikingly similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons gradually went by, she carefully discovered these similarities. The spring time, with its fresh scents and new growth, reminded Saeng of her home. So when spring arrives, she will be brimming with motivation to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to clearly show how she is heartily encouraged by memories of her homeland.
1341	10208	4	3	The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” As she was stumbling to a florist shop, the main character saw a flower that reminded her vividly of her homeland, Vietnam. “Here, let me help, mother.” In relieving her mother of the task of planting the seed that she had bought, she began to mature gradually. After reflecting deeply on the memories of her past and coming to peace with them, there was nothing left stopping her from moving forward. “When they come back, I will take that test again.” As she sees geese migrating south for the winter in a V - formation, she sets a clear goal for herself and uses that goal as a powerful tool to help herself grow and move forward in the new country she's in. The main character's vow in “Winter Hibiscus” symbolizes her journey of moving forward.
1342	10209	4	3	It shows that in this time of doubt and uncertainty, she will overcome the challenges that come her way. In the story, the plant showed a glimmer of hope, and in doing so, it directly gave her a sense of hope. All the memories that she recalled had initially made her deeply sad, but in the end, they provided her with the hope she needed to keep going. This hope is what will drive her to face the future with courage.
1343	10210	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, maybe he is trying to send out some sort of profound message to people and capture their full attention. The author also could have concluded the story with that statement because maybe he just felt an inner urge to do that. Maybe he didn't have a particular, well - defined reason for doing it, but sometimes such endings can leave a lasting impression on the readers.
1344	10211	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because it is sympathizing with Saeng's remarkable ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another earnest chance. This is symbolized clearly when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus"". After the failure of the test, she wasn't just considering retaking the test; instead, she just wished she could return to her old home and didn't know how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she firmly says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adapt to the cold, harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm. Similarly, she must wait until she is more prepared and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her inner strength and unwavering determination to pass the test the second time she takes it. Just like her, the hibiscus survives the cold weather months and blooms in the spring, so must she endure the difficult times to pass in the spring. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, assured that she will pass."
1345	10212	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is patiently waiting for a better, more opportune time. It shows that she has great perseverance and will not give up easily on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly, like a fleeting moment. And that she needs to truly appreciate every moment and use it to her advantage to achieve her goal of passing the test. This realization will fuel her determination to succeed.
1346	10213	4	3	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" to specifically say that the narrator ""Saeng"" hasn't given up on her driving test, showing her persistent spirit in the face of challenges."
1347	10214	4	3	"At the end of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author's concluding paragraph neatly shows many of the key aspects of the story in a well - crafted summary. Saeng, despite the setbacks, is firmly determined to go back to the driver's test and is whole - heartedly open to a new beginning. The author carefully used these concluding words in the paragraph to vividly express the hope in Saeng of a better start and to clearly show her unwavering determination to pass the driver's test. The author ties the significant objects in the story to effectively represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she deliberately picks because it symbolizes a brand - new beginning, and the geese returning show the strong determination of her and her resolve to transform into a new and better self."
1348	10215	4	3	The author Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to effectively evoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most crucial lessons anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will surely get better as long as you keep trying. Though Saeng was deeply sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland with a heavy heart, by ending the story with this paragraph, the important principle that “never giving up is vital” is clearly presented and carried out hopefully through the character’s vow. This principle powerfully presents the idea that people can successfully overcome hard times in their life no matter what difficult circumstances they are faced with. In conclusion, hope is effectively evoked within the reader because of the impactful ending paragraph which significantly contributes to the overall theme of the entire story; it is highly important to never give up and always hold onto hope especially when life gets tough.
1349	10216	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds much better and it makes the story flow a bit more smoothly when the author places that paragraph at the end. If the author did not put that well - thought - out ending at the end of the story, the story probably wouldn't be that engaging and wouldn't be as good. The author also wants to make the reader comprehensively understand the story, whether it's the end or the start, all at once. For example, if there were no good ending at the end of this story, hardly anyone would want to read it at all. So, it was a very wise decision for the author to put a good, stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I truly think it was an extremely good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to perfectly match the story, and I could also understand it a great deal better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the ideal ending for this story.
1350	10217	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. As the snow gradually melts, the geese will gracefully return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. It represents starting over fresh, a brand - new beginning. Since she had unfortunately failed her driving test, she decides to start over in the spring with a renewed sense of hope. In conclusion, this is precisely why I think the author concludes the story with that meaningful paragraph.
1351	10218	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to convey that in the spring, when the plant begins its new growth cycle, Saeng will also start afresh. The story clearly shows that this is the intended meaning. Saeng had endured a really harsh winter and was struggling immensely to adjust to all the novel things around her. However, come spring, she can start anew, just as the hibiscus will rejuvenate. This conclusion ties together the themes of renewal and resilience in the story.
1352	10219	4	3	The author includes this paragraph in the story for several reasons. One key reason is that the story commences by discussing Saeng's failure in her driver's test and her subsequent state of depression. It then progresses to talk about the hibiscus, which serves as a powerful reminder of her homeland and all the wonderful memories she has cherished there. This all connects to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to take the test again until the hibiscus, the thing that instills happiness and confidence in her, starts to bud. This paragraph is intricately related to every aspect of the story, from the start to the very end, highlighting the emotional journey of the character.
1353	10220	4	3	I think the author concludes this in the story because when they return, it is at the moment when the character feels she would be fully prepared to take that test again. This conclusion implies a sense of growth and readiness in the character, as she has likely used the time to gather the necessary skills and confidence. It adds a hopeful note to the story, suggesting that the character is on the verge of achieving her goal.
1354	10221	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and deeply longs for her home. The flowers in the greenhouse vividly remind her of the place where she grew up and her beloved grandmother. The quote, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her,"" powerfully depicts her emotional turmoil. Saeng cannot look at the flowers without breaking into tears. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test, but in the last paragraph, she firmly vows to herself that by spring, she will. The author is offering us valuable insight into Saeng's character. We now understand that even though it is extremely difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and loves, she will find the inner strength to thrive in a new world. This conclusion showcases the character's resilience and hope in the face of change."
1355	10222	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature are not yet over. For when the natural cycle comes back around, she will continue to engage in the activities she has been doing. This includes growing her plants with care, nurturing them, and using them to prepare a delicious dinner. She will persist in this routine until she is no longer physically able to do so. This conclusion highlights the character's deep - seated connection with nature and her commitment to this way of life.
1356	10223	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is specifically related to her new home. But when winter is gone and new hibiscus emerge, they still relate to her new home situation. The hibiscus from her old home, with their familiar sight and perhaps a certain fragrance, give her a strong sense of comfort. So when she feels that comforting feeling again, she will gather the courage and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows that Saeng still doesn't like the change and would genuinely like to go back to her old home.
1357	10224	4	3	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a completely new country. In this foreign land, she deeply misses her homeland, and the hibiscus, with its unique appearance and cultural significance, reminds her of it so vividly. Saeng took a test and unfortunately failed. Just as in the winter, flowers wither and fail, but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms once more, Saeng will also ""bloom"" and gather the strength to try the test again. Moving can be an extremely difficult hardship, especially when it is to a place that is very unfamiliar. People often find various ways to make themselves promises and to remind themselves of their old home."
1358	10225	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this spring she made a significant mistake, like buying the plants that were over @MONEY1 (dollars). Her mother, who had certain expectations, was deeply disappointed with her. So she figures that when the spring comes again, she could get another valuable opportunity to do her best and to get it right this time. Also, she is determined so that she will not be a disappointment to her mother again, and can regain her mother's trust and approval.
1359	10226	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because she said that the flower, with its beauty and familiarity, helps her cope with the difficulties of moving and constantly reminds her of her home town. And that when the geese come back, a sign of the changing seasons, and the flower starts to bloom, she'll know deep in her heart that she can pass that test. She is understandably sad for failing the test, but she realizes that it doesn't matter how many times you fail; sooner or later you will pass the test. She must feel more at ease and comfortable taking the test again when spring comes along, as it brings new hope and a fresh start.
1360	10227	4	3	I believe that the author concluded the story “Winter @CAPS1” with the paragraph that she did in order to clearly imply that Saeng will not give up easily. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was extremely sad about failing the test, but still has the resolve to take the test again, it strongly infers that Saeng is a determined and resilient person. It is my firm belief that the concluding paragraph was added to effectively convey the feeling that Saeng was determined to overcome hardships and achieve her goal despite the setbacks she faced.
1361	10228	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This is because the hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances. Saeng is attempting to adapt to the new changes in her life, yet nothing seems to be working out for her. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" @CAPS2, the Hibiscus makes her life a bit easier as it vividly reminds her of her homeland. @CAPS3, it gives her a glimmer of hope. ""Look how root - bound it is, poor thing,"" the root - bound state represents Saeng in her new country. She is unwilling to try anything new and gets easily scared. But as soon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by planting it, she is taking a step towards trying to love her new life in @LOCATION1. In spring, when the hibiscus and Saeng are both ready to blossom, she will start to whole - heartedly accept her new life."
1362	10229	4	3	Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows how far Saeng has come and her strong determination to persevere. The narrator says, “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance” (Ho @NUM1). This is the moment when Saeng is gradually recovering from crying. Even though she deeply misses her homeland, she has a firm desire to adapt and succeed in her current place. The narrator also said, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again” (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng extremely emotional and vulnerable, yet she is still trying to be strong and move forward.
1363	10230	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they believe that the plant will bring them good luck or some positive outcome. Saeng feels that the plant offers her a certain kind of comfort. This comfort might be in the form of a connection to something familiar in a new and unfamiliar environment. It gives her a sense of stability and hope in a situation where she might otherwise feel lost. The plant becomes a symbol of resilience and the possibility of a better future for her.
1364	10231	4	3	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says “through the quiet repetition of season upon season,” which implies that seasons will come and seasons will go. Time will pass steadily, but she'll always be there, steadfastly ready to “take the test.” This shows her unwavering determination and her understanding that life is a continuous cycle. No matter how many seasons pass, she remains committed to facing the challenges that come her way.
1365	10232	4	3	The author is probably trying to say that in the spring, when the seasons change, the snow melts, the geese return from their long migration, and the hibiscus starts budding, he will take the test again. The changing of the seasons represents a new beginning, a fresh start. The return of the geese symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and the hope of renewal. The budding hibiscus is a sign of growth and potential. All these elements combined give him the motivation and the right time to face the test once more, with a new sense of readiness and optimism.
1366	10233	4	3	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She realizes that as time progresses, circumstances change, and you can always get another opportunity. This is explained in the last paragraph where it's stated that once the hibiscus buds, a sign of new beginnings, she will take the test again, showing her resilience and positive outlook.
1367	10234	4	3	The author concludes the story with her saying that in the spring, a season of renewal when the snows gradually melt, the geese gracefully return, and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. This statement emphasizes that she will not just give up easily but will persevere and face the challenge once more.
1368	10235	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1. It conveys so many aspects about her in just one concise sentence. For example, when she says ""take that test again"", it clearly shows she is willing to go through the whole process all over again @CAPS1 because she loves it and has a strong desire to do it. Also, when she mentions ""in spring; when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"", it serves as a reminder that when you come back, you shouldn't forget about all the things she has just listed. That's precisely why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it encapsulates her determination and hope."
1369	10236	4	3	"This story is about believing in yourself and never giving up; it's a tale of perseverance. Saeng truly believed she could pass her driver's test. Although she was deeply disappointed with the result, she managed to find a way to cope with her setback. The hibiscus that flowers holds great significance for her as she can associate it with her homeland, and it is a sight of beauty, something she desperately needed during such a difficult and ""ugly"" time for her. It's always extremely challenging to adapt to a new country in a short period. I can empathize with what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can lose your composure, and it will seem much worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone, just like the hibiscus growing next to the busy highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver's test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring. I firmly believe the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person, representing her resilience and hope for new beginnings."
1370	10237	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. Saeng was deeply disappointed for failing her driving test. After the disappointment, she found solace in nature when she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus has not yet started to bud, it's not the right time to take the driver's test. She derives comfort from the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, which implies that nature has a soothing effect on her. The author ended it like this because it shows that Saeng is no longer disheartened about failing. She is confident that she will have another opportunity next year when the geese return and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comforting presence of nature, she feels assured that she can pass the test next time.
1371	10238	4	3	The author concludes the story with this well - chosen paragraph or quote to leave the readers with something substantial to ponder upon at the end of their reading experience. For example, it clearly indicates to the reader that the person will eagerly continue to grow plants once the cold winter season is finally over. This conclusion adds a touch of hope and continuity to the story.
1372	10239	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I firmly think the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because it vividly shows Saeng's unwavering determination. Saeng is facing significant problems with both adjusting and adapting to the numerous changes in her new life. A clear example of this can be seen when Saeng comes home with her flower. As the text states, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” We can clearly understand that Saeng bought the flower because it gave her a deep sense of security. It was a precious thing from her home that felt extremely familiar to her. I strongly believe that's why the author included this story with this paragraph, as next year she will have a comforting sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be repeated. This repetition of experience can potentially give her the confidence she needs.
1373	10240	4	3	The author concludes with this well - crafted paragraph to clearly show that Saeng is not going to give up easily. She also concludes with this paragraph to strongly tell people that they should never give up in the face of difficulties and that they should keep on trying with perseverance. Even if they have to take a short break to study more effectively or carefully rethink the plan, they should not lose hope. This message is an important lesson that the author wants to convey through the story.
1374	10241	4	3	When they came back, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the beautiful spring, when the thick snow melts away and the geese gracefully return, and this lovely hibiscus is starting to bud, then she will bravely take that test again. In the story, the author put this significant paragraph in the story to clearly show what the determined girl was planning to do to improve on her grades. This shows her long - term goal and her hope for a better outcome.
1375	10242	4	3	He ends the paragraph with this specific statement because he is clearly meaning to say that he would much rather take the test again when the outside world is beautiful and inviting. The pleasant environment might bring a positive mindset and better performance. In conclusion, this is the clear reason why I think the author ends it with this sentence, as it ties together the character's preference and the overall mood of the story.
1376	10243	4	3	At the end of the short story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the writer Minfong Ho includes a somewhat inspirational concluding sentence: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think this sentence was added in order to create a strong sense of hope for the future. This hope stands in stark contrast to the deeply depressing nature of the story, thus crafting a somewhat happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is extremely depressed as she had to leave her homeland so abruptly, losing her cherished childhood and beloved grandmother. “A blink, a changed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone,” as Saeng narrates in more poignant detail. Also contributing significantly to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how often Saeng cries while remembering her tragic past. Whether in the greenhouse, recalling tender events with her grandmother such as when she says, “Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s grey hair. Saeng would help knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it,” or in the garden when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by inserting a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully instilled a sense of hope for the future, leaving the reader with a glimmer of optimism.
1377	10244	4	3	She says that come the spring, she will take the test again because she knows that if she fails the test again, her mother will be deeply disappointed in her. Her mother might think that she isn't trying hard enough, or perhaps they will never be as close again. The mother believes that just because she keeps failing the test, it's due to her connection to her past experiences, her affection for her new country, and her ability to overcome obstacles. Finally, I think she finds comfort in the memories of her homeland, which give her the strength to face the test once more and strive for a better outcome.
1378	10245	4	3	The author concludes the story with that quote for one main and significant reason. That reason is that it clearly shows that the girl has a glimmer of hope. In a story, one of the most appealing qualities a character can possess is hope. This is because hope makes the reader genuinely interested in the character's journey and helps provide a positive and uplifting morale for the story. By ending with such a quote, the author not only engages the reader but also leaves them with a sense of optimism. That is precisely why the author concludes the story with that quote, to leave a lasting and positive impression on the readers.
1379	10246	4	3	The author of this story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a truly great and inspiring ending. The underlying message is the powerful concept of never giving up and trying again and again. The author said, “I will take the test again.” In the story, Saeng said, “I failed the test,” but now she has shown remarkable determination by not giving up. This last paragraph makes a great deal of sense and is absolutely needed to make this story complete. Just as others in @LOCATION1 persevere and don't give up, Saeng is doing the same. She is bravely retaking the test, embodying the spirit of resilience and determination, which adds a powerful and relatable element to the story.
1380	10247	4	3	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because he wants to vividly express to the readers that she is whole - heartedly determined for what she has to do to achieve what she previously failed. Since she failed the test the first time, she is eager to overcome her failure and succeed in it. The author wants her to appear resolute and unwavering in the end, leaving the readers with the impression that with determination, one can conquer their setbacks and move forward towards their goals.
1381	10248	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it effectively extends the story's length and imparts a satisfying ending. However, I'm completely at a loss as to what that paragraph actually means. Thus, it's the author's responsibility to explain its meaning, not mine.
1382	10249	4	3	The plant was extremely important to Saeng because it originated from her homeland. Saeng firmly stated that she would take her driver's test again when her plant bloomed. The plant served as a vivid reminder of her homeland and her roots. For Saeng, the plant was a source of confidence. Saeng endured difficult times, and the plant was very close to her heart because it came from her homeland, offering her a sense of connection and comfort.
1383	10250	4	3	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph specifically to create a strong sense of wonder. I think this because when you carefully put the word “test” into context, it could have multiple interpretations. For example, it could mean the test to overcome the deep - seated sadness of her difficult situation. Also, it could signify the test to smoothly adjust to her new home when the spring arrives. That is precisely why I think the author attempted to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.
1384	10251	4	3	The story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is fundamentally about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test” (NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been facing numerous difficulties at school. On her way home, she unexpectedly saw an array of flowers that were native to her homeland. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost” (NUM2). The sight of those flowers, especially the hibiscus, vividly reminded her of what she had lost and offered much - needed comfort in the face of those memories. The winter hibiscus could still thrive even though it was not in the land where it naturally belonged. Her mother states “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what” (NUM3). After hearing this, Saeng resolutely decides that she could be strong, too, and would make a sincere effort to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the resilient winter hibiscus.
1385	10252	4	3	She said that because she was far more interested in the beauty and intricacies of flowers than in the pressure and stress of a test. This preference clearly influenced her statement, highlighting her passion for the natural world over academic evaluations.
1386	10253	4	3	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it clearly shows the ending of one chapter and the beginning of a new one. After she experiences a wave of upset and spends time thinking about home, she gradually realizes that something new is on the horizon, and she needs to gracefully accept it. So, just as the flowers blossom vibrantly in the spring, she is going to embark on a fresh start.
1387	10254	4	3	The author ends the story with this particular paragraph because he aims to convey the key point that the character is cautious and doesn't want to rush headlong into things. She firmly believes in doing things the right way and is determined not to take the easy or quick way out. This approach emphasizes her values and the importance of making well - thought - out decisions.
1388	10255	4	3	It vividly shows the great importance of the Hibiscus to Saeng and her unwavering dedication to this beautiful flower. It is also explicitly stating that she is patiently going to wait for next spring to once again admire the delicate beauty of the flower, cherishing the moment and the connection she has with it.
1389	10256	4	3	The author ends this story with this paragraph because she is carefully explaining her innermost thoughts and the reasons behind her decision to take that test. She is looking forward and explaining that next year she will finally find out if this place truly feels like home to her, a sense of belonging that she has been seeking.
1390	10257	4	3	When the author concluded the narrative by stating “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”, it powerfully demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her deep connection to her past experiences. First, it demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles because obstacles are an inevitable part of everyone's lives, and one has no choice but to conquer them as they seem unlimited. So, the hibiscus flower symbolically represents the obstacles, and the weather represents time because the harsh weather conditions are temporarily stopping the flower from blooming and blossoming. Secondly, it also represents the finding of comfort in a time of disappointment because when one is going through an obstacle, disappointment often lingers nearby. However, she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back, and she has the awareness that the obstacles will also return. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which makes her feel like an outsider. She captures the sense of being out of place, as one can relate that the hibiscus flower would be like her because she is unique and different from the rest of the people in her environment. She is trying to adapt her way of living and survive in this new world, much like when she was in her own country. This shows her resilience and the hope she holds for a better future.
1391	10258	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represents Saeng's determination and the situation she is in now. She has just come to the new country and has not yet adjusted herself to this unfamiliar environment. She was disappointed, described as “a shaft of the war afternoon starlight.” The word “war” showed that Saeng was extremely upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her beloved homeland that she missed deeply. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself to the new situation, yet she was still too shaky to express her feelings at home. Finally, she burst into tears again as she missed her homeland very much. “Snows” symbolized the difficult situation she was facing now. But she believed she could overcome it and that life was full of hope. “Spring” symbolized the hope for the new life. Saeng thought things would get better in the spring and she would succeed. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at the conclusion as it symbolizes hope.
1392	10259	4	3	The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test, perhaps she should be given a second chance as she had tried so hard before. When Saeng says “Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it,” it made her mom upset because she had spent a large amount of money on one plant just to feel at home again, as she had one when she was in her old home. Eventually, her mom said, “It’s a beautiful plant” to make her feel better as she felt bad about how she had acted towards her daughter. After all the difficulties Saeng had to go through, this is the reason the author added the last passage into the story.
1393	10260	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, indicating that Saeng will not quit until she passes that test. She will try and try, persevering until the end. The author is referring back to the story's core theme of Saeng's tenacity. By using this paragraph as the conclusion, it emphasizes Saeng's unwavering determination to achieve success in the test.
1394	10261	4	3	The author's purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return, she will have to once again take care of the plant. This is clear because taking a test is a significant responsibility, and similarly, taking care of that plant is also a huge task, which is being compared to taking the test again. The conclusion implies that just as the cycle of the seasons brings new responsibilities for the plant, Saeng will face the test repeatedly. This is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.
1395	10262	4	3	Because planting flowers and spending time in the garden is @CAPS1's hobby. And without this hobby, she cannot think clearly or be creative. Therefore, waiting until they are back will make her happier, and she will also be able to focus on her work. Engaging in her gardening hobby provides her with a sense of calm and inspiration, which is essential for her to perform well in her tasks.
1396	10263	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several well - thought - out reasons. One is that she implies when everything gets back to the normal state of affairs, that's precisely when she is going to take the test once again. Second, if the situation is not back to the way she desired it to be, there would be nothing more meaningful to say. For instance, if you were in the process of building a house and a blizzard suddenly arrived, you would immediately stop. You'd firmly state that you would not continue construction until there was nice, favorable weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many valid reasons.
1397	10264	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, ended the story in this way to clearly show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to this powerful theme of starting over by saying, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough to make it through the winter. That’s what matters.” Her words serve as a perfect metaphor for the family starting their lives anew in @LOCATION1. It suggests that @LOCATION1 might not be as visually appealing as their previous home, but it has the resilience to survive, which is of utmost importance. Her words effectively soothe her daughter's worries about starting afresh. Also, the budding hibiscus can be aptly considered a symbol of rebirth, since it experiences the cycle of dying and growing with the changing seasons. The family is transitioning from a @CAPS1 family to being a @CAPS2 which was an @CAPS3 family. However, even though they “died” as a @CAPS1 family, that does not mean that they have lost their precious heritage. This is why the author ends the story talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 and @CAPS3, just like Saeng, tying together the themes of heritage and new beginnings.
1398	10265	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show that Saeng will persevere through the harsh winter and make a sincere attempt to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country and embracing a different culture is an extremely arduous task, and Saeng is having a tough time, but she doesn't give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,” is filled with determination and hope. Throughout the entire story, Saeng was struggling with adapting, and her memories of her homeland give her a sense of much - needed security. The sentence effectively wraps up her complex emotions and shows how strong she is. Many @CAPS1 people could easily give up on their driving test, but she won't. It is a happy ending for what is somewhat of a sad story. Moreover, the sentence further shows Saeng's connection to her plant. This hibiscus will survive, and so will Saeng. When the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard as she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of Vietnam as well as giving her a companion throughout the long winter. The author could not have chosen a better conclusion for this story. The conclusion offers a new hope to persevere and succeed. As a result, the reader is left with a sense of pleasure and a positive feeling towards the story. This conclusion shows how Saeng is adapting to changes with hope and is looking forward to enjoying her new life in @LOCATION1.
1399	10266	4	3	The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and completely breaking down about her “home” where she no longer lived. After she had an emotional breakdown, bought the plant, and finally learned to truly accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and that she had failed her driving test, she came to the realization that she just has to learn to like her new situation. She also understood that her time will come and she will one day be driving with confidence. The reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the natural conclusion of the story. This is the point where the character realizes the important things in her new life journey.
1400	10267	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement where Saeng silently vows to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again, specifically referring to the driver's test. The sight of the geese flying in a “V” formation and the presence of the hibiscus gave Saeng a deep - seated sense of remembrance of her beloved homeland. Saeng dearly misses her homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the @CAPS1 as if Saeng is gradually starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a powerful symbol to Saeng, telling her that it will be @CAPS2 okay. It assures her that it's perfectly fine for her to miss Vietnam, but also that it's okay to embrace a new life. So, Saeng, come the spring, will go take her driver's test again with a brand - new, positive attitude and is likely to pass the test, marking a new chapter in her life of adaptation and growth.
1401	10268	4	3	The author used that well - crafted paragraph in order to create vivid imagery. By carefully choosing words and descriptions, the author wants you to clearly get a detailed image of the story in your mind. She also used that paragraph to express her innermost emotions, allowing the readers to better understand her feelings. This way, the story becomes more engaging and relatable.
1402	10269	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to specifically tell you the time when Saeng was going to take the test again. Also, it is to show her intention to reunite with the plant again. This is a well - thought - out conclusion paragraph that gives valuable insight on what will happen in the future. That's also the exact reason why the author added this paragraph in the story.
1403	10270	4	3	The author ends the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to clearly show a comparison. Since the plant vividly reminds her of home, when it buds she will be much more confident to take the test. When she was tenderly looking at the petals of the flower, it said, “Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.” This powerfully shows that she really deeply missed her home, and she had almost nothing to give her the needed confidence. The flower is the precious piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even successfully pass her driver's test. Saeng felt completely out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her strong motivation. It gave her a great chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, “And that rich sweet scent - that was familiar too”. This clearly shows that this flower was of sentimental importance, which she truly needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.
1404	10271	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho ends the story the way she does to clearly show a sign of hope. Saeng is going to start over when the world starts over anew. Spring is the beautiful time when animals come out of their winter holes, when trees blossom with colorful flowers, and when the snow gradually melts. It is a time of renewal. Saeng “Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time. Saeng purchases the hibiscus not only in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by gracefully coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in the hope of a brand - new beginning. Saeng vows, “Then I will take that test again.” The word choice of “That test again” precisely depicts her new positive attitude. She wants to try again for her test with full determination.
1405	10272	4	3	To show how extremely absent she feels without them by her side, you can clearly see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says “when they come back”. Also, when she says “the geese return & this hibiscus is budding”, it shows how she feels during their absence and how she will feel when they return. It also shows how she will bravely carry on where they left off last time, as shown when she says “Then I will take that test again”. This indicates her resilience and hope for a better outcome.
1406	10273	4	3	I think *Winter Hibiscus* by Minfong Ho was a good enough read. Throughout the story, you feel somewhat happy and somewhat sad, but always calm. You feel happy when they are talking about all the beautiful plants and when her mother graciously accepts the plants she bought. At first, when you think the mom is going to yell at her for buying the plants after she failed her test, you feel bad for her. Yet, there's still a calm mood, showing that the girl doesn't want to give up but just needs to take her time. This gentle mix of emotions makes the story quite engaging and relatable.
1407	10274	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with the paragraph saying that she's going to take the test again, to clearly show us that this time she's going to pass the test and she won't feel the same way she felt when she didn't pass. It tells us in “spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” because that's precisely when she is going to take the test. This conclusion gives a sense of hope and a clear timeline for the character's next step.
1408	10275	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to bravely tell her mother what she had done, “she failed the test”. Probably her mom would get upset with her, but then she'd talk to her again. Saeng's mother asked her about the plant that she had with her. Saeng said that she bought the plant with some money. She was sad because she failed the test, and when she bought the plant, it probably made her feel a bit better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it brings some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said “then I will take that test again”, it might be the plant that makes her decide to take it again. This shows the plant's symbolic importance in her journey.
1409	10276	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants to clearly show the readers that Saeng will be determined to pass her driver license test. The reason is so that the readers can see how determined Saeng is after the winter. For example, in the story, Saeng failed her driver license test and was really sad about it. Another example is that when she found this flower, she knew she could do it again. This shows that the flower helped her feel better and gave her the motivation to try again. The first example shows that she was sad that she failed the test. At the conclusion, the author put this statement in the story to show readers that Saeng will pass the driver license test later on, highlighting her resilience.
1410	10277	4	3	In the story *Winter Hibiscus* by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying “when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive and hopeful ending. The rest of the story is rather sad because Saeng deeply misses her home in Vietnam. “It’s – it’s not a real one. I mean, it’s not like the kind we had at – at –” she found that she was still too shaky to say the words “at home”, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the ones we had before.” The end sends a powerful message that even though things are different than before, she won't give up trying to make a good life in the United States and won't let this change negatively affect her. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of optimism for Saeng's future.
1411	10278	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to know that she will regain her confidence when the ""hibiscus is budding"" and take another shot at the driving test. He doesn't want to simply leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the far - off distance. The girl felt extremely bad about failing the test, which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"". So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy, leaving a positive and hopeful impression."
1412	10279	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: the beautiful gardens filled with colorful flowers, her kind - hearted grandparents, and the familiar way of life. For example, when she walked into the flower shop, she smelled the flowers just like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that vividly reminded her of her grandmother's “long gray hair, freshly washed …”. But by saying that last sentence, she indicated that when the hibiscus budded next winter, she will take the test that she failed again, showing her unwavering resolve.
1413	10280	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" because the girl is willing to try again and to not give up no matter what. The girl is upset because she doesn't have the real flower her mom had. ""It’s - it's not a real one,"" Saeng mumbled, “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at.” She was so upset and afraid that her mother was going to be angry with her that she started to shake. “I know,” her mother said quietly. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake."" The author is just showing that the girl is going to try again next time, highlighting her tenacity."
1414	10281	4	3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph because he wants to get across to the reader that Saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and it has been quite hard for her to adjust to the numerous changes. Saeng really misses her homeland and the flowers that she saw in her old life. She explains how the winter hibiscus is not the same as the one in Vietnam, so she plants this local type of flower and decides to wait till the spring to take the driving test. This shows that Saeng wants to put aside her difficulties in @LOCATION2 and think of them again in the spring when the weather is pleasant and the atmosphere is inviting. She is not giving up but she does not want to deal with the difficulties till a later time. That is why the author concluded with this paragraph, emphasizing her resilience.
1415	10282	4	3	I think he uses it because she wants to get another one next year to see what it's like to like something so much and get to look after it for a while. Taking care of it would give her a sense of responsibility and connection. That is why I think the narrator uses that phrase as his last one, as it encapsulates the character's longing and future aspiration.
1416	10283	4	3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it vividly shows how Saeng is gradually adapting with the change she is going through in @LOCATION1. The winter hibiscus, a constant presence, helped her @CAPS1 during the difficult time of failing her driving test. So, Saeng firmly figures it will give her the much - needed luck when she takes the test again. Also, the hibiscus has the resilience to survive, and while she works steadily towards her goal, it will develop more. Once the flower finally blooms, it will clearly symbolize strength, effectively helping Saeng overcome this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive. She means @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 may not be as great as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong and persevere.
1417	10284	4	3	The purpose for the ending the Author @CAPS1 is to clearly show how the hibiscus gives Saeng a strong sense of comfort, in sharp contrast to how she was at the very beginning of the story. It was as if she had extremely little confidence. And now, she is reluctantly forced to call this strange place home, and that situation emptied her @CAPS2 drive to strive until she sees a very familiar face that instantly brings back her memories of when she was the happiest. Having something around that was truly special to her all the time can make @CAPS3 feel at home or like it used to be. She found her comfort in the hibiscus. So now that it gracefully rests in her garden to constantly grow through all the seasons, she will too, with that warm reminder of her old home and how good it felt, except now with new and precious memories.
1418	10285	4	3	@PERSON1 starts the journey and steadily go to the top of the hill. Once reaching the top, they then carefully make their way over the hill, finally completing the short but eventful passage.
1419	10286	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different and significant reasons. The author wants to show with deep meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be highly symbolic. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.” This shows meaning because it is currently a crucial point in time where Saeng has to bravely overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead, it clearly shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another important point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more profound meaning to the seasons. Ho states, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to successfully succeed and become somehow like a new and stronger person.
1420	10287	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she feels like the audience should truly know what Saeng is deeply feeling. This paragraph ending clearly shows that Saeng will keep persistently trying every spring to grow back her flowers. This consistent effort shows that Saeng has a great deal of potential to make her vow to herself to be successful a reality.
1421	10288	4	3	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people. Given this central theme, it is quite appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the entire reading, Saeng, in the face of various difficulties, sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as the delicate beauty of flowers and the unique taste of bitter melon. She was deeply hurting and disappointed, and those familiar things were the only sources that gave her a sense of peace. It was these things that saved the courage she needed to retake her driver’s test in the spring. So, it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also clearly shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...” At first, the sounds of geese were completely alien to her, but now she has calmly accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is gradually learning to accept her new country, which is indeed the perfect way to end the story as it reflects her growth and adaptation.
1422	10289	4	3	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time, she won't be able to see the hibiscus that she is so accustomed to. She has a deep - seated habit of going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful hibiscus plant, which brings her a lot of comfort and a sense of familiarity. In conclusion, the author concludes the story that way because in the winter time, the cold and snow will cover the garden, and she won't be able to see her beloved plant, so it becomes a significant factor in how the story is wrapped up.
1423	10290	4	3	In the story, Saeng is earnestly trying to be okay with her new home. The new environment is full of unfamiliar things, but she is making efforts to fit in. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. Despite the challenges, she is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng sincerely wants to adjust, but the memories and feelings associated with her old home are so strong that she misses it too much. The longing for her old home makes it difficult for her to fully embrace the new one at present. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again, as spring might bring new hope and a more favorable atmosphere for her to make a fresh start.
1424	10291	4	3	The author concludes the story with that line to leave the reader guessing. The “she” in the story means that she is determined to live up to her past experiences and get through the difficulties she has faced. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder if she got through it the following year. The author describes the snow melting and geese coming back as a symbol of change, which is exactly what she hopes to achieve. Just as the natural world changes with the seasons, she hopes to transform herself and overcome the challenges. The author was trying to show how she can change and grow just like her plant, which goes through different stages of growth and development. This open - ended conclusion makes the story more thought - provoking and allows the readers to imagine her future journey of growth and change.
1425	10292	4	3	The author used the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She writes that because when her flower starts budding, it represents a new beginning and a sign of hope. She is like a flower, needing the right time and conditions to bloom and show her strength. The author uses this conclusion because when the flower is going to bud and the geese come back, these natural phenomena will bring a sense of familiarity and comfort to her. She will think that she is back home in a way, as these are the scenes and feelings she associates with her past. That's why I think the author used the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, as it perfectly captures her emotions and her hope for a new start.
1426	10293	4	3	In winter hibiscus, the young teenage girl Saeng fails her driver’s test. Disheartened, she then runs into a winter hibiscus and through this encounter, comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with the idea of re - trying the test when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, a symbol that shows comfort and a sense of familiarity. When the speaker says “almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become”, this example clearly shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature, and it is this re - connection with nature that was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for the reader because it took her until winter to discover this. Winter is when it seems too late, as the geese have left and the flower has closed. But when spring comes, both the natural world and she will be open to new opportunities with the familiarity around her. This ending leaves the reader hopeful for Saeng's future test attempt.
1427	10294	4	3	I think she concluded with this statement because she is unsure if she will pass the driver's test, but she is determined and not giving up. She plans to try to pass it again when her flower, which has become a source of comfort, grows back. Right now, after failing the test, she feels bad, and the plant has helped to cheer her up. So, when she sees the plant in full bloom next year, she wants to take the test. The plant is like a sign of good luck for her. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves the reader with the powerful idea that one should not give up when times are hard and instead keep trying. This message is both inspiring and relatable, making the story's ending impactful.
1428	10295	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few well - thought - out reasons. One of the reasons is so the reader could vividly imagine what the rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example, when the author said “then I will take that test again”, it makes the reader picture Saeng preparing for and taking the test once more. Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. When the author said “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, it paints a beautiful and hopeful picture. These details create a positive and forward - looking atmosphere. Those were the reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism.
1429	10296	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because when the snow is slowly melting, the plant is starting to bud, and the geese are coming back, then she will take the test again. This is a very deliberate way for her to really think about when she is going to do this again. The natural cycle of the snow melting, the plant budding, and the geese returning gives a clear and symbolic timeline. When these natural events occur, so will she, ready to take the test over again. This conclusion ties the character's journey to the natural world, making the story more meaningful and the ending more impactful.
1430	10297	4	3	In the story, Saeng vowed silently to herself, “When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again.” For some reason, I think that is a fine idea Saeng vowed. The combination of these natural events represents a new beginning, a time of renewal. The melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus all symbolize hope and fresh starts. By tying her test attempt to these natural phenomena, Saeng is giving herself a clear and positive goal. It shows her determination and her connection to the natural world, making her vow both practical and inspiring. This vow gives the story a sense of purpose and a hopeful ending.
1431	10298	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” probably chose to end the story that way because then it’s ending with a palpable sense of hope. Also, it is vividly showing how Saeng is gradually adapting to her surroundings, much like the resilient winter hibiscus. In the second - last paragraph, Saeng hears the honks of the geese, and it is carefully noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of time. Saeng probably firmly vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because that time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a clear sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adapting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is precisely why the story ends there as it concludes the narrative on an optimistic note.
1432	10299	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, as we know, seasons change, and plants most likely don't grow during winter time. This natural phenomenon teaches us a valuable lesson. We should learn from the situation and accept it as it is, patiently waiting until the next time we can learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes. This approach allows us to make the most of the circumstances and grow from our experiences.
1433	10300	4	3	I think that in the story “Winter Hibiscus” was a good story, rich in moral and charm. Also, the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to encourage readers to work hard. That is why it mentions at the very end “I will take the test again”. This shows that you don't fall and stay down; instead, you work hard, get back up, and try again. The story thus imparts a powerful message of perseverance and resilience.
1434	10301	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can clearly tell the overall meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral to the story and provides you with pointers or some events in the story you didn't know about. By including this paragraph, the author ties up loose ends and gives the readers a deeper understanding of the story's central message, making the entire narrative more coherent and impactful.
1435	10302	4	3	The story is somewhat sad. The girl deeply misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author, I think, ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to clearly show that even though she is sad about her country and failing, she is not going to give up. Failing a test, especially a driving test, stinks. You're very excited to get it but then you don't. So the author is trying to show that despite the girl's sadness, she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also, the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note. You usually don't want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did, but the above are the more obvious ones, highlighting the story's theme of hope and perseverance.
1436	10303	4	3	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the story ends with that phrase to clearly show that Saeng has well - defined goals. First and foremost, she has a strong desire to adapt to this new land. This is evident as she mentions that when they come back in the spring. This statement implies that she won't give up easily and will earnestly try to adapt to her new life. It also showcases her precision. She is determined to continue trying to get her license as she firmly states, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Her declaration that she will try again is a testament to her resolve. Moreover, it reveals that she will gather the courage to keep on trying and not yield to failure. This determination of Saeng is a key aspect of the story, highlighting her strength of character."
1437	10304	4	3	Saeng was patiently waiting for spring so that she could take the test again. I think she was worried about it during spring because she went to watch the geese fly in a perfect U - shape. She also went to see the plant grow, but unfortunately, the snow didn't melt yet. She started talking to herself about it, expressing her eagerness to take the test during spring. She hopes that if she can pass it this time, she won't have to take the test over and over again. When everyone moves on to different things after the test is over, Saeng will finally feel a sense of relief and accomplishment.
1438	10305	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng, who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just returned home after failing her driver’s test. To Saeng, her failure in the driver’s test clearly shows that she is having difficulty adapting to her family's new lifestyle. As a result, she deeply feels that she has disappointed both her mother and herself. On her way home, she bought a flower that her family also had back in Vietnam, hoping to comfort her mother. As her mother begins to carefully plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, Saeng feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the driver's test. Then she realizes that she has gradually adapted to her surroundings, just as she believes her flower will. This realization motivates her to promise to take the driver's test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng’s promise, Minfong, the author, ensures that the last and most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn't give up. She made a firm promise to herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings, unlike some others around her. Her promise is a shining example of courage and perseverance, leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
1439	10306	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to emphasize that Saeng is not giving up. Saeng is determined and will take the test again. Just as the plant, the winter hibiscus, will grow again in the @DATE1, Saeng believes that she too will have a new start. This cycle of growth and renewal is a powerful symbol in the story. It shows that despite setbacks, there is always hope for a better outcome. Saeng's resilience is reflected in this connection between her and the plant, and the author uses this to leave a positive and inspiring message with the readers.
1440	10307	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is clearly saying that she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story, she mentions that she failed the test because she felt she didn't impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are accustomed to life in Vietnam, and they are now trying to adjust to a new environment. Saeng initially thought that the hibiscus she got was just like the one she had at home. At the end, she has a profound realization that if she just has faith, everything will be @CAPS1 and it will be just like home. She mentions the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully grown. She will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is as beautiful as the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng's journey of learning to adapt to her new country, the United States, is a central theme of the story. Her determination and new - found hope through the hibiscus symbolize the possibility of a better future in this foreign land.
1441	10308	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it effectively expresses and continues the overarching theme of perseverance and adapting to change. The conclusion deliberately mentions the “test” again. From a careful reading, one can reasonably conclude that this test the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without succumbing to the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test,” having broken down in tears after looking at all the familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which clearly states she will take the test again, it vividly shows that Saeng is going to continue to make efforts to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of constantly feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It powerfully shows the theme of perseverance because she is resolutely going to take the test again and try to overcome the deep - seated feeling of sorrow, thereby reaffirming her determination to move forward.
1442	10309	4	3	The girl is determined to win. She went and took a test related to a flower. Unfortunately, she did not pass the test. After that, she went back feeling sad and emotional. She told her grandmother that these flowers were not like the ones at... she couldn't bring herself to say “at home” because it brought too much pain. Her grandmother gently said that they were not like the real ones. This interaction with her grandmother shows that the girl is grappling with the difference between her new environment and her old home, but her determination to win implies that she won't be easily discouraged.
1443	10310	4	3	In this story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with, “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In the beginning of the story, she was less confident and this lack of confidence led to her failing the test. However, this one flower gave her a glimmer of hope. So, when she takes the test next time, she'll be better prepared mentally and emotionally. This shows her growth and the potential for a more positive outcome in the future.
1444	10311	4	3	The author would conclude the essay like he did because it sounded good and helped to bring all the scattered ideas together. For example, one person said, “She silently vowed to herself in the spring after the snow melts she would retake that test.” This conclusion ties in well with the overall flow of the essay, giving a sense of closure and a hint of future possibility. It allows the readers to see that there is a continuation of the character's journey and that there is hope for a better result in the end.
1445	10312	4	3	I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter, all or most plants die off. During the spring, they would have to start all over in growing this plant. This parallels the character's situation. Just as the plants face a cycle of death and rebirth, the character is going through a difficult phase but has the opportunity for a fresh start. Ending the story this way gives a sense of hope and the inevitability of change and renewal, leaving the readers with a positive outlook on the character's future.
1446	10313	4	3	The author ends the story this way because they're trying to show that Saeng will be whole - heartedly dedicated to hibiscus gardening. Once she painstakingly proves herself through her efforts in this gardening, she will have passed the unspoken test. It also clearly shows that she deeply wants her heritage to be a major, integral part of her life by carefully growing the flower of their nation. This ending effectively ties together Saeng's connection to her roots and her journey of self - discovery.
1447	10314	4	3	The author ends the story with this quote because it vividly shows how incredibly determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story “Winter Hibiscus”, after Saeng fails her driving test, she is visibly upset. To distract herself from the disappointment, she says something about forgetting about the setback and firmly states, “Let’s plant, right now”. She utters this because she is attempting to forget about her failure and instead focus on something positive. In conclusion, this is exactly why the author ends with this quote, as it serves as a great example of how determined and focused Saeng is to eventually passing her driving test.
1448	10315	4	3	The author concluded the story the way they did because it left a glimmer of hope. Saeng had been deeply hurt and extremely disappointed when she failed her driving test. The failure hit her hard, and she felt a sense of loss and discouragement. However, in the end, she showed remarkable resilience and hope. In the new country, despite this setback, it was evident that she was not going to quit. She was going to bravely move on and make the very best of what she had, which is a powerful message that the author conveyed through the story's ending.
1449	10316	4	3	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph because she is determined to complete and pass the test. The first reason is that she failed this year and has a strong desire to pass next year. She is not willing to let this failure define her and is looking forward to the next opportunity. Next, she is making an interesting comparison between the hibiscus and her passing and succeeding on the test. Just as the hibiscus grows and thrives, she hopes to grow and succeed in passing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, highlighting Saeng's determination and her unique way of looking at her goals.
1450	10317	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to make a sincere attempt to keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again is that she previously sold the plant to somebody. This sale might have been a source of regret for her. Saeng had seen the plant before as a child, and that early encounter made her so emotionally attached to it. This connection to the plant is what drives her to want to keep the next one. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng's new - found resolve to try and keep her next plant, which symbolizes her growth and commitment.
1451	10318	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph to clearly show that after a certain time period has passed, you can come back and make another attempt at something. Or perhaps when the weather undergoes a change, this situation can be quite different for Saeng. Maybe she is closely relating herself to the plant, thinking that when spring arrives, the flower will become stronger. And she firmly feels that she will pass the test the second time around when the geese return and the hibiscus starts budding. Moreover, it also vividly shows how she appreciates nature because if not, why would she patiently wait until spring and when the snow begins to melt. The conclusion of the story strongly indicates that she truly likes nature, as she frequently talks about the hibiscus, which serves as a symbol of hope and renewal for her.
1452	10319	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng is struggling to adjust to life in a new place, @LOCATION1, after coming from Vietnam. She is deeply sad and misses her home, especially after failing her driver's test. One day, as she walks by a store, she suddenly recognizes a plant from her home. She decides to buy it and carefully takes it home in a pot. She says that she is thinking of home and all the wonderful memories she shared with such a plant. Her mother then comes and joins her, sharing this precious moment with her. Saeng feels much better now. In the end sentence, the author includes “Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” (Ho, ??) The flower has given her the confidence to succeed, and she is determined to take the test again. This clearly shows the strong connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and move forward, not leaving her memories behind but leaving her pain behind.
1453	10320	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to clearly show the comfort the hibiscus provided, which allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a safe and warm place for her to pour out her feelings about her homesickness. “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home, she was once again faced with the harsh reality of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test, it brought out deep - seated feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust to her new home. But when the geese fly by, the author brought the story to a conclusion to vividly show how the experience has made Saeng grow. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” I think the author wanted to convey that through the events in the story, she was able to gradually overcome her feelings about a new home and find the courage to face new challenges.
1454	10321	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it's going to be a brand - new start for herself in the spring. She talks about how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snow has completely melted, and it's the beautiful season of spring that's when she'll retake the test. To me, it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life,” it's as if it's having a second chance, and she believes she deserves one too. When it's bright outside again and everything starts looking better, she'll feel much more confident and good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was really good. You just have to carefully read into it and try to fully understand what she is actually saying. So practically, she's stating once everything “comes back to life,” then she'll feel like she will surely pass it next time. Now she can take the time to be well - prepared and face the test with a positive attitude.
1455	10322	4	3	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. One reason is that she has a deep - seated fondness for the hibiscus flower. You can tell this by when she again says “When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently,” showing her gentle and affectionate connection with it. Another reason is that they are incredibly pretty. You can tell by when she says “It was like walking into another world,” which vividly describes the enchanting beauty of the hibiscus. The last reason is that she likes the presence of them. You can tell by when she says “Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps, ferns, and fronds and varieties of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.” As you can see, these are the clear reasons why the author ended with that paragraph, as the hibiscus plays a significant role in the story, representing beauty, comfort, and a connection to something meaningful.
1456	10323	4	3	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every flower in the garden blooms vibrantly. This girl just recently failed her driving test, and understandably, she does not want to take it right away. The blooming of the hibiscus, with its bright and colorful petals, symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it fully blossoms. This natural phenomenon will give her the confidence to pass her driving test and make her excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return”. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and feel comfortable. At home, you are at ease and can gather the strength to face challenges. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they ended it, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for Saeng's future."
1457	10324	4	3	The hibiscus, as the author has revealed to the audience, is a beautiful flower. In the story, it represents the memories of a young girl who has failed the test. Knowing she was extremely depressed for her failing the test, the flower helps as a symbol of encouragement to the sad girl in her most trying event. It shows how a little flower, with its sweet fragrance, gives comfort to the girl. The girl Saeng vowed to demonstrate that when she overcomes the sad memories, she'll be able to prove she will pass. After she feels okay about the situation she is experiencing with her disrupted life after having to come to a different country where one must have a certain level of adaptability, and it’s logical that the adaptation of the girl is not going to be immediate. In other words, the author's message is to motivate the people who have problems in their lives and that life is not about giving up. Instead, you should keep working hard until you achieve your goals. In conclusion, working hard and not giving up is a part of our life and it’s up to ourselves to overcome failure and move forward with determination.
1458	10325	4	3	"In the story, the author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think the author ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also, she is making a solemn promise, or a vow to herself and showing her resolve not to give up on her goal. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future attempts and the possibility of her achieving success after this set - back."
1459	10326	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because they both go together. The way they are both about things going and leaving, and the season changing. For example, the snow melts and the geese leave and then return. It's like they don't want to let go but they know they'll be back soon. The changing of the season represents the cycle of life and the ebb and flow of experiences. The author combines the story with the paragraph to show that just as nature has its cycles, life also has its ups and downs. This connection emphasizes the idea that setbacks are temporary and there is always the promise of a new beginning. That's why the author combined the story with the paragraph, creating a harmonious and meaningful ending that leaves the reader with a deeper understanding of the story's message.
1460	10327	4	3	The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph. Although just failing her driver's test and adjusting to a new atmosphere, Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. “It felt smooth and cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.” This description expresses that the remembrance of “an old friend” was able to lift her spirits after a previous disappointment. It was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. “She paused as she noticed the tear stains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.” Her daughter was not adjusting well to her new atmosphere, and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower, her mother understood her pain. With all the negative attitude throughout the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her “winter” hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes that with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failure comes success, and this realization gives her the strength to face the future with optimism and determination.
1461	10328	4	3	The author concluded the story in the paragraph. She doesn't want Saeng to vow the whole room to herself where it's quiet when she is taking the test, as it might not be a fair or proper way during the testing environment.
1462	10329	4	3	She is saying that right now, is not the right time to table the test. She is clearly stating that she is going to wait to come back until spring, when the flowers are blooming, to take the test. @CAPS1 She is so enthusiastic about the exotic flowers. She simply can't stand to do it now, when the time isn't right. So she is firmly saying that she is going to wait until the time is right to take the test.
1463	10330	4	3	Saeng will take the test in the spring when it's not so cold outside. She truly likes it when the hibiscus is budding as they smell so delightfully sweet. Their good smell reminds her deeply of her native country. Saeng really likes fried melon, as it leaves a golden, lingering aftertaste on your tongue. She would definitely prefer it over a Big Mac.
1464	10331	4	3	There are many reasons why the author ends the story with this particular paragraph, which plays an important role in wrapping up the narrative.
1465	10332	4	3	The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng “comfort in her time of discomfort.” She would possibly feel more at ease when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus vividly reminds her of that. She failed the test the first time because she was not fully comfortable with being in a new place. But when spring comes, she'll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding, which will give her the strength to face the test again.
1466	10333	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, Saeng was deeply frustrated as she talked about how she failed the important test, a test she had really hoped to ace and was eager to retake. So, Saeng firmly declared that next year, when the geese gracefully return and the hibiscus starts budding with vibrant promise, she shall take the test again, determined to achieve a better result.
1467	10334	4	3	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show Saeng that she will patiently be waiting for the hibiscus to grow back and she will bravely try again for her test. The hibiscus holds great emotional value for her, representing a connection to her roots and a source of strength. She will keep trying because she doesn't want to see the disappointment in her mother's eyes again. An example of where Saeng felt intense shame is when ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" Saeng is resolved to not let herself or her mother down. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"", making a solemn promise that she will pass the test and also respect nature as well as her elders."
1468	10335	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is budding with new life, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, Saeng is extremely upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the United States, so she is a little homesick. She spots a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it instantly cheers her up, vividly reminding her of the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng has not given up and that she is going to try and pass the driver's license test again. But what you don't know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhanger. That is why the author ended the story in this way.
1469	10336	4	3	Saeng has been the unfortunate victim of a tragic loss in her family and also a difficult move to a totally different world, where everything seems unfamiliar and challenging. The paragraph is symbolic of turning over a new leaf and starting anew. The “snows melting” and “hibiscus budding” are both powerfully symbolizing new life, a fresh start full of hope. Saeng is going to have a positive outlook on life and bravely accept her situation to make the best of it. Also, the author says “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now” as it does compare to Saeng's new - found outlook firmly planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was carefully planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom and embrace the future with optimism.
1470	10337	4	3	In the story, “winter hibiscus,” by [Organization], the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it vividly reminds her so much of her beloved home. The reason why the author concludes the story with that saying was because it gave her a clear goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she truly believes that the Hibiscus is a symbol of good luck, so she sets a specific goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, a flood of happy memories came rushing back to her, filling her heart with warmth. In conclusion, certain things can unexpectedly trigger your memories, but it's the good memories that make things in life something truly worth waiting and hoping for.
1471	10338	4	3	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First, it clearly shows that she is gradually starting to like this new life. Also, it is an ending that remains open. It demonstrates her liking for her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now.” This is the moment when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This part is about the geese and is referred back to when she firmly vows to take the test. Also, it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already of great importance to her. The second thing it does is evoke dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the determined way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did, to show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw their own conclusions.
1472	10339	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story where she fails the driving test, so they added that she was determined to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be a symbol of good luck to her. After the snow completely melts and the geese gracefully return, it would mark a fresh start. Also, it would be a heart - warming outcome after she discovered the plant, offering her hope for a better result in the next driving test.
1473	10340	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she has a strong desire to try again. The author is specifically saying that the hibiscus she planted @DATE1 did not thrive as expected, and she is now making another attempt this @DATE1 to grow a healthy hibiscus plant. She firmly believes that she will pass the test if she succeeds in growing the plant in the spring. That is why the author concludes with this paragraph, tying together the hope of plant growth with the hope of test success.
1474	10341	4	3	He concludes that when the gentle warmth of spring arrives, he will take the test again. This decision will give her another well - deserved chance to pass it. By taking the test once more, this will give her another opportunity to prove herself and do what is right, to achieve the goal she has set for herself.
1475	10342	4	3	She is going to take the test again @CAPS1 as she genuinely feels like she needs to. And she notices that when the snow finally melts and the geese return in a flurry of activity, it means she wants to take the test in the Spring. This indicates her eagerness to embrace the new season and the fresh start it brings, hoping for a successful outcome in the test.
1476	10343	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1 sentence is “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This poignant moment reveals Saeng's determination. I think the remembrance of home will help her take the test. She uses the geese and the plant to remind her of home, and having these familiar surroundings makes her feel comfortable and gives her the strength to face the test once more.
1477	10344	4	3	In the same way the hibiscus flower bravely prevails in the harsh winter, Saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test, which makes her feel deeply unsuccessful. She yearns to prevail and stick it out, but the rough times she's going through make it extremely difficult for her. When Saeng says “I – I failed the test”, this clearly shows that she feels disappointed as she didn't expect such an outcome because she is a true fighter. So, the author ends the passage with Saeng saying “When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This powerfully demonstrates how much of a fighter Saeng is, as she's determined to strive under difficult conditions and prove herself.
1478	10345	4	3	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that Saeng is looking for a new lease, almost a fresh start, on life. She now has something meaningful to take her through the year that lies ahead of her. She now waits patiently till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again, and she anticipates many more beautiful blooms to come. This hope and anticipation give her a sense of purpose and a reason to keep going.
1479	10346	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday. That “someday” is symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she misses her homeland deeply, and she sees plants that bring back vivid memories. So, she buys a winter hibiscus to ease and comfort her and to constantly remind her of home. This connection to home gives her the motivation to face future challenges and try again.
1480	10347	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she loves her garden deeply. She concludes it this way because the story is about them and their garden, and it eventually turns cold, leaving them with nothing to do until Spring. It suggests they have strong feelings for what they do, as it says “in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. Here, she wants to take the test to overcome the setbacks and prove that she can take good care of her garden. This determination and love for the garden are the driving forces behind her decision to face the test again.
1481	10348	4	3	At this moment, she firmly vowed to retake a test. She thought about how the flowers will always bloom and wither, coming and going in their natural cycle, but her grades for school work are a one - time deal. Instead, she would rather spend time gardening than doing her schoolwork. This shows her current priorities, though she knows she should focus on academics.
1482	10349	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus, with its delicate petals and unique presence, gave her a glimmer of hope. Also, because her mother was understanding and empathetic about her failing the test, offering words of comfort. That is precisely why the author concludes the story with the paragraph, as it ties together these elements of hope and support.
1483	10350	4	3	The author concludes the story with a palpable sense of optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows gently melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” By concluding the story in that way, it effectively helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her driver's test. The hibiscus gradually helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, were almost familiar to her now.” In the way the author ends the story, it offers inspiration for a new beginning and a new season, leaving the reader with a feeling of anticipation for Saeng's future.
1484	10351	4	3	In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, written by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng tries her best to adjust to a new country, but it seems nearly an insurmountable task. She is extremely stressed about failing the driver's test, and she realizes that everything in this new country is different. Except for one thing that she quickly recognized. A plant called the “Winter Hibiscus.” Its appearance and fragrance made her vividly think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her persevere through hard times, and she didn't want to give up on anything. This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the last paragraph by stating that Saeng will retry the driving test when the hibiscus is budding. The flower gives her a strong sense of home in Vietnam, making her determined to try again and again. Also, the author ends the story like this to convey a theme. This particular theme is, “No matter how hard something might be, you can get through it. You just have to find a way that benefits you most.” This theme resonates throughout the story and leaves the reader with valuable life lessons.
1485	10352	4	3	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is deeply sorry that she did not @CAPS1 the test. Now, filled with determination, Saeng wants to make up for it. She firmly vowed to herself that she will @CAPS1 that test. For example, just like when I tell myself I am going to get something done, I put in all the effort and do what it takes to achieve my goal, and I don't give up even when things get tough. @CAPS3. This last sentence truly captures the main idea of the story, which is to make up for the failed test and @CAPS1 it, and to have the resolve to get done what needs to be done, no matter the challenges.
1486	10353	4	3	The reason why this author includes this particular story within this paragraph is that it still revolves around Saeng. The description of Saeng is more in line with her character, and she has a mind that flits about like a butterfly that was once trapped and then burst out. This is similar to the relationship between Saeng and her mom, and as a teenage girl, I can kind of relate to the same feelings as Saeng. This connection makes the inclusion of the story fitting in this context.
1487	10354	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is deliberately there to clearly show that Saeng has not given up on her dreams. She firmly says, “When they come back…then I will take that test again.” Here, she is specifically talking about the hibiscus and the geese, which are the things that strongly remind her of her beloved home. When these reminders of home return and give her the much - needed strength, she will surely have the power and determination to take the test. This vividly shows that even though she has faced failure, she remains resolute and will not give up. Instead, she will bravely try again. I firmly believe that is precisely the purpose of the paragraph, to emphasize that Saeng hasn't given up.
1488	10355	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story in such a way is that he is clearly telling the reader that after the snow completely leaves, the author will enthusiastically begin to plant more plants. The test here is of great significance; it is to carefully make sure that his plants don't die during the next @DATE1. This kind of conclusion gives a sense of hope and a new beginning for the plant - related activities in the story.
1489	10356	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the author is clearly stating that Saeng feels truly happy when she is in the presence of the plant. She finds a deep sense of peace with the plant because it vividly brings back precious childhood memories. For example, she mentions “And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton.” She genuinely loved the way the plant made her feel. When one of the leaves gently fell off and she took a deep breath in, it immediately reminded her of her dear grandmother. @CAPS1 might have actually experienced something quite similar in their own life. @CAPS1 might have written this story because it could easily relate to other people who have moved from another country and have something special that brings back warm memories. Just like me, every time I touch or smell a sweater, it instantly brings back wonderful memories of my grandmother. I feel that @CAPS1 wrote this because of their personal experience, and it can surely resonate with others.
1490	10357	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to effectively show how some people silently vow because they don't want to openly express themselves. Also, maybe it's because they are not very trusting of other people, or even of themselves. One day, I was in a similar state. I didn't want to talk to anybody at all. All I wanted to do was quietly sit in my room and deeply think. I was thinking about my life and where I was going to go after I die. I would just sit in my room in the dark, constantly wondering if I would come back in another body or if my soul would roam the earth. But then I started to think that I'm just a kid, and I have a wonderful future ahead of me. I'll deal with those deep - thinking things when I reach the appropriate stage. So, I mustered up the courage and started talking to everybody again, realizing that there's more to life than just silent pondering.
1491	10358	4	3	The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author wants you to vividly feel like the character in the book is highly determined. The author is trying to put across a clear statement saying to get through difficulties and then try again. The character is firmly not giving up, and she will surely get through the test even though it's extremely hard, which showcases her indomitable spirit.
1492	10359	4	3	The author is talking about gardening and how she earnestly wants to get better at it in the spring. She probably thinks she's rather bad at gardening because her mom is truly excellent at it, and she deeply desires to be that good at gardening too, perhaps to share a similar passion with her mom.
1493	10360	4	3	The reason why is so you can fully get the feeling that Saeng has about gardening. She is eagerly praying for spring to come so she can do it all over again. She really likes to watch plants grow and transform into something that you can actually eat. That is why the Author concluded the story with this paragraph, to convey Saeng's love for gardening.
1494	10361	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the hibiscus symbolize Saeng's strong determination, because they always come back no matter what challenges they face. Saeng will be back to take the test, just like the geese will also return year after year. The hibiscus also symbolizes her because it has faced significant adversity as well. It has been taken to new places and had new homes, much like Saeng, and has a harsh winter coming in the near future. However, it always manages to find a way to come back and bloom beautifully in the spring, which is exactly what Saeng hopes to do by taking the driver's test. The author included the last paragraph to clearly show the symbolism between Saeng, the geese, and the hibiscus. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, to leave a powerful message of hope and perseverance.
1495	10362	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he is basically trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might be closely related to the changing seasons. She @MONTH1 thinks that she would have performed better on her test in the spring only for the simple fact that everything thrives and blooms in the spring, symbolizing new beginnings and better chances.
1496	10363	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it vividly shows that despite moving from her homeland, she has the resilience to go through these obstacles. Also, it clearly shows that she has gained more confidence. That's precisely why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.
1497	10364	4	3	“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it reveals what Saeng's mindset is regarding her life, that regardless of what has happened, she will take the test again. In the story, it mentions that one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. This indicates that they take great care of their garden and strive to keep it alive even in the winter. So, that's what I think about the last paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
1498	10365	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up concisely. “When the snow melts and the geese return” basically harks back to the beginning of the story when Saeng started planting her garden. This is the exact reason why the author gave the story such an ending conclusion.
1499	10366	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few significant reasons. First, the test is of great importance to Saeng as it allows her to prove to herself that she is fully capable of passing it. Ending with this paragraph also effectively gives the reader some palpable suspense as to whether Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph clearly shows Saeng's personality traits. It shows that she is persistent in her pursuits, determined to achieve her goal, and strong - willed in the face of setbacks.
1500	10367	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” at the end of the story, the author writes “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again.” The reason why the author said that is because she is trying to tell the readers in a clear way to get right back up and do it again. If you fall once, there is no harm in trying again. When it's spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promises to take the driver's test. After failing a driver test, Saeng buys a flower at a florist that reminded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and puts it in the garden. After telling her mother that she failed, Saeng's mother was very understanding and told her maybe next time. In conclusion, the author writes the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.
1501	10368	4	3	The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone in a state of wondering. I believe she ended it that way to let us know that she will be back, and when she comes back, she will be fully ready for everything, including that challenging test. She left us wondering because when she does come back, she is going to want us to read about what took place when she returned and what happened when she attempted the test. She only made that vow to herself and nobody else because if she did, she would have let them down if she failed. That is precisely why she concludes the story in such a manner.
1502	10369	4	3	The author ends the story with this particular ending because she is clearly indicating that she will be around next year to take the test once again. She is expressing how she eagerly wants to be present when the plants start to grow. Specifically, she mostly wants to see the beautiful hibiscus plants grow. Since she appreciates and likes nature so profoundly, she desires to be around again to witness their growth and the beauty they bring.
1503	10370	4	3	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to vividly show how sentimental and highly important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter has passed because it is simply too cold for nice hibiscus plants to survive in such harsh conditions. You need a winter - adapted hibiscus. “Not like the kind we had before” (@NUM1). This clearly shows how crucial it is that she finds a hibiscus similar to the ones she had at her home. She shows disappointment in herself until that last paragraph when she finally shows remarkable courage and a strong will, which wraps up the story's message about her growth.
1504	10371	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows gradually melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is starting to bud, then I will take that test again. The author concluded this story in such a way that it makes the reader ask numerous questions, much like in the “@CAPS1’s @ORGANIZATION1” when there was a modernist way to interpret by making the reader ask questions instead of there being a straightforward moral to the story. For example, in the “@CAPS1’s @ORGANIZATION1” the main character @PERSON1 ran away and all we could hear was a slamming door. Just like in this story, there is a twist in that what test is the main character talking about? Is she going to try to move with friends? Is this like a resolution she is making to herself? Also, this leaves the reader wanting more of the story so that they might even go back and read it again to find some answers.
1505	10372	4	3	The “Winter Hibiscus” is a relatively sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of well - crafted symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel truly satisfied. The two main reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph are to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. “Winter Hibiscus” ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something clear to look forward to as a goal. It also reveals how strong - willed of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph skillfully links these two symbols together, so the reader can easily relate them to the spring. The way the author concluded the story was brilliantly done. It represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring. It ends confidently, and leaves the reader completely satisfied, making the story a memorable one.
1506	10373	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to convey a message of perseverance and not giving up. For example, she wants to show us that we should never give up at anything, even if we fail. Therefore, that's why she ends the story like that, leaving a powerful reminder of the importance of resilience.
1507	10374	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to effectively get her point across to the readers. Also, she aimed to create a clear understanding of the complexities present in the passage. The author desired that the reader would feel her message as vividly as if they were right there to witness the events described. By concluding in this way, the author ensures that the essence of her story lingers with the readers.
1508	10375	4	3	The author concluded the story with the sentence because the author wanted to show that since Saeng found the flower, she has gained new hope and a strong reason for passing the driving test. The flower gave her inspiration as it made her look back on her home in Vietnam. “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at,” she said, but she found that she was still too shaky to fully express the words about home. When Saeng brought the plant to her new home and planted it in the garden, it was like bringing a little piece of Vietnam home, which made her feel better. The overall inspiration and the precious memories the flower held for Saeng made her feel more at ease in her new home and gave her a reason to start fresh with her driving test, marking a new beginning in her life.
1509	10376	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return from their winter migration and this hibiscus is budding after the long, cold winter, she will tend to them again with care and enthusiasm. This conclusion reflects the cycle of life and the hope that comes with the renewal of nature, leaving a sense of optimism for the future.
1510	10377	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes in her life. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, Saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding to turn it into a positive experience instead of dwelling on the negative. The author is showing that if you're having trouble, you should try again; through the main character, Saeng, the message of perseverance and resilience is effectively conveyed, leaving the readers with a sense of hope and inspiration.
1511	10378	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for a lot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is that she might be eager to try it again, perhaps having learned from previous attempts. A second reason is that she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud, driven by the love and respect she holds for her. A third reason is that she probably really felt that she had truly disappointed herself, and the determination to do better welled up within her. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again. Maybe you will do a lot better, as perseverance often leads to improvement.
1512	10379	4	3	Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to vividly show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become deeply sad because she vividly remembered her home in Vietnam. She strongly longed for her natural home and the comforting familiarity it offered. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now far away and in a completely different world. However, the author started to subtly reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find some precious childhood memories there too. “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and – yes – familiar to Saeng now.” Already, Saeng was gradually growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories vibrantly alive, as the geese would help her feel genuinely happy and well - accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and “@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue to build a successful life and eventually pass her test. That is precisely why Minfong Ho ended “Winter Hibiscus” with the particular paragraph.
1513	10380	4	3	The author concludes the story in “Winter Hibiscus” in a kind of funny/weird way. The concluding sentence is “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I know one thing: part of the title is in the concluding sentence, so it is basically concluding the whole story, neatly tying up all the loose ends, plus it also brings closure to the characters' arcs. This well - crafted ending effectively sums up the themes and the journey of the story.
1514	10381	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it clearly shows that the narrator is fully ready. The narrator tried the test once and unfortunately failed. She then bought herself a beautiful flower to cheer herself up, finding solace in its presence. Her mother had a heart - to - heart talk with her, and after that conversation, she felt much better. She felt a strong determination to pass the driving test, just like the flower was determined to bravely survive despite the odds. This shared determination between the narrator and the flower is what makes the conclusion so fitting, as it represents the narrator's new - found resolve.
1515	10382	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it powerfully symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always gracefully melts when the seasons change, a natural and inevitable process. The geese always faithfully come back when the seasons change, following their age - old migratory patterns. The hibiscus will delicately bud when the seasons change, a sign of new life and growth. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But she'll be a different person also. Having witnessed the cycle of nature and the resilience of the hibiscus, she realizes that while everything around her will change, the essence of who she is and her connection to @CAPS1 will remain the same. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has developed more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and vividly remembering her past. This new - found appreciation and self - awareness make her ready to face the future with a fresh perspective.
1516	10383	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph clearly shows that Saeng is determined to take the test again. It implies that she will be well - prepared and confident, and there is a high chance that she will pass the test. Moreover, the author ends the story with this paragraph because it gives a sense of closure. Knowing that Saeng will retake the test, it shows that she has the faith and courage to face the challenge again. By passing the test, she hopes to make her mother proud. This is precisely why the author concludes the story with this impactful paragraph.
1517	10384	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring, the weather is warmer and more pleasant, making it a more enjoyable time. Additionally, it provides a positive and energetic atmosphere. Also, during the winter, Saeng will have sufficient time to thoroughly study all the necessary materials for the test in the spring. As she says in the story, it aligns well with the conclusion at the end. She finally grasped the situation, and she connected it to the way the geese return in spring, symbolizing new beginnings and hope. This connection makes the ending both meaningful and fitting.
1518	10385	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it is what she solemnly promised herself. This self - vow is a significant commitment. By ending the story with this, it emphasizes the determination and resolve within her. It shows that she is bound by her own words and will follow through with what she has set out to do. This conclusion gives the story a sense of purpose and a clear direction for the character's future actions.
1519	10386	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng first enters the store, she is immediately overwhelmed by a flood of forgotten memories of living in Vietnam. The description “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world” highlights this powerful emotional connection. At this moment, Saeng starts to associate herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another familiar plant in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to sit in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs.” This thought perfectly symbolizes her situation. Away from her home in Vietnam, she feels out of place, caged, and restricted, while back home, she was much more free - spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as “strong enough to make it through the cold months.” Saeng closely identifies herself with this description. She decides that when the hibiscus has endured the difficult times and starts to bud and grow, she too will have overcome her challenges. Then, she will be fully ready to achieve her goal of retaking the test.
1520	10387	4	3	"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng firmly believes that if the hibiscus can survive through harsh and difficult times, adapt to the new environment, and thrive, she can do the same. Moving to the United States has brought many differences and challenges for Saeng, but she realizes that she is strong enough to endure. Failing her driver's test does not mean that she is incapable. Instead, she sees it as an opportunity to try again with a fresh start, just like the hibiscus that emerges anew after the cold winter. This ending shows her resilience and positive outlook on life, and it gives a hopeful message about her future."
1521	10388	4	3	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1. By doing so, the author wants to clearly show that Saeng hasn't given up. Early in the story, Saeng goes to the greenhouse and starts to cry. When she gets home, she says to her mother, “I - I failed the test.” Because of @CAPS1, Saeng was determined to go back and try again. That is precisely why the author ended with that paragraph, emphasizing Saeng's unwavering spirit.
1522	10389	4	3	The last paragraph was added in order to vividly represent the determinedness and the ability to adapt to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held a deep - seated bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower, she gradually accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will transform into a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with the situation is that she actively makes friends. And though the food she offered was rejected, she didn't give in. The moment of breakdown occurred as she got the flower. After she got home, it was all over, and once again, she gracefully accepts the change, showing her resilience.
1523	10390	4	3	The author includes the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up easily, and she will definitely try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them at her homeland, and it will provide her with a sense of comfort and help her cope. For example, Saeng started to cry because she deeply missed her homeland, and the flower was a link to her past. This shows that she is using the flower as a source of strength to face her challenges.
1524	10391	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he thinks when the flowers come back, they would be better. He believes that the flowers will bloom more vibrantly and beautifully. I think that he thinks that it would be a better test next time, with more favorable conditions and opportunities for success. This conclusion gives a sense of hope and anticipation for the future.
1525	10392	4	3	The author concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph because it effectively continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam, and it is quite a significant change for her. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different in this new environment. The mother in the story says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus.” The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more in - depth understanding to the story’s message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about adapting to life's changes.
1526	10393	4	3	The story is about him failing the important test. He looks quite dejected. She notices his state and gently says she will try next year when the geese come back, offering him a bit of comfort and hope.
1527	10394	4	3	I think he means that seasons change in a natural and inevitable way, and that winter will come again, bringing with it cold and challenges. I think that the cycle and impact of these seasonal changes is the test that life presents.
1528	10395	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a clear - cut goal, which is to survive the harsh winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm and find suitable food sources. This is similar to Saeng as both moved to a different environment where they must adapt to new circumstances. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs to be strong and resilient to overcome winter. From this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong - willed to overcome the test of life. If her hibiscus can overcome its test, winter, then she can survive and change her own situation for the better.
1529	10396	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” includes “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because it shows that she can adapt to change and still can think about her old country too. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life is “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.” This shows that she can still eat the traditional foods she ate back at her old home while also trying new things at her new home. In conclusion, the excerpt shows that the author can blend both cultures together and find happiness in this harmonious co - existence.
1530	10397	4	3	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have great importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, with its warmth and newness, she will have many more reasons and a better state of mind to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a brand - new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year gradually disappearing. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year full of vitality. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life afresh. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year, she can move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing a new beginning that she will have to go through the next year, full of potential and hope.
1531	10398	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the phrase “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. By using this phrase, the author is saying that Saeng will be ready for whatever challenges come her way the next time they return.
1532	10399	4	3	The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to effectively show the themes of this story. One prominent theme of the story is to never give up. The winter hibiscus has to endure the long and harsh winter, but it does manage to survive. This resilience of the hibiscus inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another significant theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers throughout the winter, but still manages to blossom. Saeng, seeing the flower's ability to overcome, wants to overcome her own obstacles and pass the test. Therefore, the ending of the story effectively displays these important themes.
1533	10400	4	3	The author concludes this part of the story because it made the story stand out a little. For example, when Saeng said that she meant when the plants came back, it added a layer of meaning. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on to, rather than simply continuing to talk about the plants or geese which could potentially get the reader off - topic. Last, she also meant when the geese came back, which further ties into the seasonal and symbolic elements of the story.
1534	10401	4	3	I think the author finishes the story with that part where the girl sees this plant as a symbol of strength and faith. So, she decides that she will take the test next year when the plant comes back. She truly has a fondness for the plant, and she hopes that it will bring her luck as she attempts the test again.
1535	10402	4	3	I think the author ended the story with that specific phrase to clearly show that the girl won't give up. No matter how difficult the situation is, she keeps trying. In the story, the girl says “I failed the test,” and then at the end of the story, she states “I will take that test again”. This shows that she is not willing to accept failure forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to pique the reader's curiosity and make you wonder if she will ever pass the test, leaving an open - ended and thought - provoking conclusion.
1536	10403	4	3	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take, she wasn't fully prepared for it before. Maybe she lacked the necessary knowledge or skills. But now, whenever the geese return and the hibiscus blossoms reappear, she will be ready to take the test. Perhaps in the past, she wasn't mentally in the right state. So, in conclusion, I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return, she will take the test. It's likely that she wasn't physically and mentally well - prepared for it earlier, but now she's looking forward to a better attempt.
1537	10404	4	3	Authors carefully choose their closing paragraphs. The author chose to end their story with this particular paragraph because all of the elements the actor mentions in the last paragraph hold something special in the characters' eyes. There are specific reasons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The author's choice of the ending paragraph is extremely important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus she mentions represents the ability to overcome obstacles. In the story, it details the girl overcoming a failed test and getting ready to retake it. That is precisely why the author concludes with that. The author also writes, “when the snow melts and the geese return”. This, to the character, represents new beginnings and chances. It gives the character the strong sense that next time around, she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph at the end to symbolize new beginnings, chances, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons, and this author did so to symbolize important concepts related to hope and perseverance.
1538	10405	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when it's cold and silent, she keeps to herself and is perhaps a bit withdrawn, but when the snow melts and spring arrives, she becomes more lively and does lots of fun things. Spring brings a change in her mood and behavior, and the author uses this contrast to end the story, showing how the change of seasons can also bring a change in a person's state of mind and actions.
1539	10406	4	3	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that fly down south in a beautiful V - shaped formation, fly down every season like clockwork. So she tells herself, firmly, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” As she looks up at the geese, she is almost vividly reminded of an experience she went through that was somewhat similar. This connection to the seasons and the geese gives her the motivation and the sense that it's a natural cycle for her to try again.
1540	10407	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to emphasize that you can overcome a defeat or failure by waiting until the “season” comes again for you to re - endure. Basically, the hibiscus (a plant) meant a great deal to the narrator and her mother. The hibiscus was dying, and they dug up a hole to help it grow. So when it grows again, it proves that it will be thriving better. When Saeng relates this to the test, it means she will have the opportunity to pass the test. The story with this paragraph symbolizes a new beginning about to take place. This actually means a situation that will come around again, which will help you get what you missed out on before. The story and the paragraph emphasize that life is about a budding cycle of hope, renewal, and the chance to overcome setbacks."
1541	10408	4	3	She canít wait till the colorful flowers start to come back when the thick snow melts and the outside temperature rises so it isnít very cold anymore, allowing them to grow. She is going to take the important test that she has unfortunately failed when the geese return and the flowers bloom.
1542	10409	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to clearly show that Saeng, much like the geese that migrate and the hibiscus that blossoms, will return again and hold onto hope. Saeng is a little deeply depressed in the story because she has recently moved to a new country and just failed her crucial driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back vivid and painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, it is very comforting. Later in the story, she carefully plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother slowly goes inside, Saeng watches the geese gracefully fly overhead. ìAlmost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.î Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in full bloom again too to provide her with much - needed hope. This is precisely what the final paragraph in the story ìwinter hibiscusî means.
1543	10410	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show Saengís everlasting determination. This idea of her unwavering determination to succeed can be closely connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she clearly knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is severely limiting its growth, just like Saengís new country seems extremely unordinary, and she feels completely out of place.
1544	10411	4	3	The author concludes the story with Saeng firmly telling herself sheíll take the test again because it effectively draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can gradually get used to a new environment by carefully finding beauty in it and obvious similarities to your old home. Saeng says that ìmany of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.î And when sheís in the greenhouse, the lush plants draw her back into warm memories of Vietnam and her dear grandmother. Saeng was having a really hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re - taking the test because it clearly demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and foreshadows her future success and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.
1545	10412	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a brand - new beginning. The author uses the senses in her story. The cold winter is the current season and the warm spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the harsh winter when most things die, she is eagerly looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. The spring season will come and new life will be provided to all, bringing a fresh start and renewed hope.
1546	10413	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is like a concise summary that conveys most of the story's essence in a small and shorter way, neatly wrapping up the key elements.
1547	10414	4	3	This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it directly relates to the test. The narrator, with determination, says she will try again in the spring, leaving a sense of hope and future possibility in the story's conclusion.
1548	10415	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it precisely captures what the story is all about. It simply explains what happened in the end, as if what occurred through the story was akin to the growth and living cycle of a flower, symbolizing the journey and development within the narrative.
1549	10416	4	3	The story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story in what seems like an incomplete paragraph. The girl Saeng vows to take her driver test over when the spring comes. When Saeng was holding the plant, she felt cold and helpless, much like how the plant appeared. “Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.” By Saeng's mother reassuring her that she was okay with her choice, it made Saeng grow as a person. “I'm glad you got it.” Saeng's mother also says, “look how root - bound it is, poor thing.” That in a way describes Saeng clinging to stay connected with her country. Saeng’s mother also tells her that now the plant will surely survive. When the spring comes, the plant will be just as strong, and so will Saeng. This is precisely why the author leaves off where she did, leaving a message of hope and growth.
1550	10417	4	3	The author concludes the story by showing the girl’s deep connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese. The “Winter hibiscus” serves as her strong connection to her homeland. She said she’ll retake her driving test when her plant buds and shows bravery, and so she will muster the same courage. The geese flying south symbolize her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, just as she returns from her own personal journey of self - discovery and growth.
1551	10418	4	3	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story, there was a depressing, nostalgic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put an emphasis on being strong even though you may not enjoy where you are at. Also, the author wanted to show the strength of the main character, Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world, she still wishes to continue pushing forward. This adds more dimension to the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to inspire you to keep going.
1552	10420	4	3	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home, much like the hibiscus needs time to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard, she sees the hibiscus and has vivid memories of her old home, which makes her cry but yet feel a sense of comfort at the same time. This connection between her and the hibiscus highlights the process of adaptation and the longing for familiarity.
1553	10421	4	3	I believe the author concludes that passage in the story to show patience. Saeng was told to wait for spring, maybe it will then feel more like her hometown again. She likes the spring better than the winter because of the vibrant life it brings. She enjoys how the birds, especially the geese, return in spring. They go away in winter, leaving the landscape feeling empty. That is why I believe the author concludes that passage, to convey the hope and renewal associated with the changing seasons.
1554	10422	4	3	“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamiliar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly unknown. By ending the story with this quote, it suggests that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, the people she loved deeply, and an endless list of precious memories. At times, she may have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now “out of the box,” and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and “failed her test.” The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting, which is a powerful message of resilience.
1555	10423	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This means that she will take the test and hopes she passes so she could make her mother happy and gain her support. She chose spring because spring is the rebirth of nature, and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind, unburdened by the weight of her previous failure. I think that the reason why the author chose to put this paragraph at the end of the story is to show the character's growth and determination, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for her future.
1556	10424	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story, Saeng constantly struggles with her past, which includes the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and tries hard to overcome it. The paragraph helps bring a clear sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus, she tearfully tells her mother she couldn't help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I - I failed the test.” When she says “the test,” she specifically means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph, Saeng shows determination as she says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces, leaving a sense of hope for her future.
1557	10425	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with a glimmer of hope. For example, since she has moved to the United States, she often feels deeply homesick. To make matters worse, she failed the driver’s test, which added to her disappointment. “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” This quote vividly helps add to the image of the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, bringing with it warmth and new beginnings, she’ll start out fresh and re - live her life in @LOCATION2, leaving behind the sadness and setbacks.
1558	10426	4	3	The author concluded this story with the paragraph because, Saeng is explaining to the readers that she will take the test again when the time is truly right. When things in her life seem to be gradually getting better, such as when she has more peace of mind and is more confident, she will retake the test. This shows her perseverance and hope. That is why the author used that paragraph to conclude her story, as it leaves the readers with a sense of Saeng's determination for a better future.
1559	10427	4	3	In the story Winter Hibiscus written by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator goes to a greenhouse filled with many colorful flowers, but one in particular catches her eye. A “winter” Hibiscus plant stands out. This plant powerfully reminds her of her homeland and all the happy events that used to take place there. This plant also vividly reminds her of her grandmother's long, silky gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the gentle sun and then help her knot it up into a bun with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she says “I - I failed the test.” And the end of this passage says “..., then I will take the test again,” showing a shift from defeat to hope.
1560	10428	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng fails the drivers test. “I - I failed the test,” said Saeng with a disappointed tone. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower strongly reminded her of some of the precious memories from home and the hibiscus she had at her house. At the end, she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has completely melted, and the hibiscus is budding. She does this, I think, because she needs time to calmly think things through, to just remember the good old days back home and to make a beautiful hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or faced a setback. Saeng failed the test, and the hibiscus was confined to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad situation and move towards a better future."
1561	10429	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in such a way to convey the determination and the newly - found motivation that Saeng discovered by purchasing the familiar plant. Despite failing her test, coming across a plant that brought back memories of her home and her grandmother filled her with the drive to retake the test. She was resolute to make her new life in this new country turn out for the better, regardless of the challenges. “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ‘u’ was etched against the evening sky ...” The author included details about the geese to symbolize moving on. Just like the geese that leave and return, Saeng too had a set - back when she failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and observing the birds inspired her to give it another shot. “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.” Among the things that had become familiar to her in her new home were the geese. Concluding the stay with a mention of the geese conveys to the reader that she is gradually learning to adapt to her unfamiliar new home. Finding the plant was a great help as it was already a part of her past. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ‘@CAPS1,’ Saeng said.” After failing her driver’s test, stepping into the florist’s shop and finding that plant offered her comfort. It made this new place feel more like home than it did initially. The geese had become a common sight over time, and finding the plant was simply a source of solace. Concluding the story in this manner shows the reader that she is adapting and learning to cope with a difficult situation in a comforting way, which ultimately gives hope for her future in the new country.
1562	10430	4	3	"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO, the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is clearly saying that when the year starts anew and begins afresh, she will also start over. She is making a connection between the natural cycle of the geese returning, the snow melting, and the hibiscus starting to bud. All these natural phenomena signify a new beginning. When the geese fly back, the snow melts away, and the Hibiscus starts to show buds, they all mark the start of a new phase. So, when she goes to take the test, it will be a brand - new year, a year filled with new opportunities and a chance for her to succeed where she previously failed. This conclusion emphasizes the idea of renewal and the hope for a better outcome."
1563	10431	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended her story with words related to the fact that @CAPS1 failed her driving test. When Saeng noticed her past through the flower, she couldn't hold back her tears. The act of buying dok malik seeds also shows the significance of the story's ending. As the seasons change, the seeds will grow, just as Saeng will grow from this experience. The end of the story is set up in this way to suggest that next season, Saeng will have a new chance. The flower and the seeds are symbols of hope and renewal, indicating that despite the setback of failing the driving test, there is a bright future ahead. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of optimism about Saeng's journey in the new environment.
1564	10432	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly show that saeng is extremely determined. She clearly states that she is going to take the test again, which is a strong indication of her unwavering resolve. Even though saeng failed her driver's test, she refuses to let this setback defeat her. She is not one to give up easily. This determination is a key trait that will likely help her succeed in the future. By ending the story with this message, the author wants the reader to understand that Saeng has the strength and the will to overcome obstacles and achieve her goals. It gives a positive outlook on her future attempts at the driving test and her life in general.
1565	10433	4	3	The author used that sentence because the snow is gradually melting, and the geese are starting to come back. The flowers are also budding up, which is a clear sign of the changing season. These natural phenomena are all interconnected and represent new beginnings. The melting snow symbolizes the end of a cold and difficult period, while the returning geese and budding flowers signify the arrival of warmth and growth. I think the author used that sentence to draw a parallel between these natural changes and the character's journey. Just as nature is renewing itself, the character is also getting a chance for a fresh start. This conclusion ties the story to the cycle of life and gives a sense of hope and optimism. Scribed by @ORGANIZATION1.
1566	10434	4	3	I believe that this was a truly good ending to the story. When Saeng says “When they come back,” she is clearly talking about the flowers. Specifically, she means when the flowers come back alive. “In the spring” explicitly shows the time when the flowers will come back. When she says “When the snows melt and the geese return,” she is indicating that after winter (when the snows melt) and when the geese return (which is in spring). “And this Hibiscus is budding” – she is stating when the flowers bloom again in the spring. “Then I will take the test again,” she is saying that after all these natural events happen, she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be intently watching all these things happening and counting down until spring arrives again, so she can retake the test. She is eagerly ready for spring to be here, so that she can study hard, pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her clear - cut goal for the winter, until spring finally comes!
1567	10435	4	3	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring, when everything in nature blossoms beautifully. During winter, when there is snow covering the ground, she wouldn't be able to focus properly. So, when the hibiscus is budding, which is a sign of the vibrant spring, that's precisely when she will be able to take her test again. I think the author wrote that ending because the arrival of spring and the blooming of flowers mean something significant to her. It represents a fresh start and a time of new opportunities for her to succeed in the test.
1568	10436	4	3	This conclusion of the story provides a strong sense of hope for the future. The girl is understandably upset that she failed the test, but she still holds firm hope for what will happen next. In the story, the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This simple yet powerful quote is clearly showing that she is not going to quit and give up easily. Instead, she will keep trying until she finally succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to eagerly wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because they are both embarking on a hard - fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding,” she is saying that when everything in nature comes to life and is at its highest peak, she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is definite hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test, she will certainly be well - prepared and ready to pass it in the spring.
1569	10437	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of well - thought - out reasons. These reasons are likely related to the overall theme and message the author wants to convey to the readers. By ending the story with this specific paragraph, the author might be trying to leave a lasting impression, evoke certain emotions, or tie up loose ends in a meaningful way. It could also be a way to provide closure to the characters' arcs and the events of the story.
1570	10438	4	3	Saeng is @CAPS1 that it will be a long time before she will worry about school work again. This is because perhaps the current situation is too overwhelming or the time isn't right for her to focus on studies. That's why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. By doing so, the author is highlighting Saeng's current state of mind and how it relates to the overall flow and message of the story. It gives the readers an insight into Saeng's perspective and the reasons behind her thoughts about school work.
1571	10439	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because he wants to emphasize that the girl is not completely dissatisfied with leaving her home. She may have some mixed feelings, but there's a glimmer of acceptance in her. He ended with that because he wanted to show that there is hope for her to learn to love her new home as time goes by.
1572	10440	4	3	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng, who has been under a lot of pressure from the test, needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing two seemingly indifferent things: flowers and taking a test. This comparison is significant as it reveals her unique perspective. That's why the author ends the story with this sentence to let readers understand Saeng's state of mind.
1573	10441	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. Just as the hibiscus goes through a cycle and blooms beautifully, the next time it blooms, the girl will be ready for the test. She will take it again with full - fledged preparation and will pass. The author wants to show that the girl will not give up easily and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the hibiscus will bloom at the same time, and when that happens, she will pass the test successfully.
1574	10442	4	3	Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring. The fresh air and the vibrant colors of spring make her feel at ease. She can concentrate better with her favorite flower around, as she thinks the flower relates to her life in many ways. It could symbolize her growth and resilience, which helps her focus on her goals.
1575	10443	4	3	The author ends the story like that to show the theme of working hard. The story has various elements that represent this theme. Some other examples of working hard are the “winter hibiscus”. Despite the harsh winter conditions, it perseveres and tries to bloom. Another example is her vow to pass the test. She is determined to put in the effort. So, that is why the author ends the story that way to drive home the importance of hard work.
1576	10444	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with. To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her driver's test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she has an immediate urge to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a tough time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her driver's test again, once the flowers start budding and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her and help her overcome obstacles, showing the power of nostalgia and familiarity in difficult times.
1577	10445	4	3	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these techniques, a story might seem bland, average, or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho conveys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a solemn promise on the geese that she will. The author ended the story like this to show how strongly she felt about the test, emphasizing her determination and the significance of this goal in her life.
1578	10446	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of Saeng. Just as Saeng can't give up and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, harsh winter and come back strong. The hibiscus are a symbol of hope, and Saeng thinks of them as her beacon of hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to Saeng because they vividly remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things. For Saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those tough conditions, reassures her that she'll be okay there as well, highlighting the universal nature of finding strength in symbols.
1579	10447	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are coming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming vibrantly, and she will re - take the test. At the beginning, Saeng was deeply depressed about having to leave her old country and beloved grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way forward, and now she is going to retake her driver's test, ready to embrace this new chapter with newfound determination.
1580	10448	4	3	I think the author concludes this story with this ending paragraph because the story is all about how she feels comforted in the plants. She wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way she will be more at ease with her surroundings and can clear her mind. By waiting for these natural signs, she can create a more positive and familiar environment, allowing her to do her best on the test, as she believes in the power of these natural elements to boost her confidence and performance.
1581	10449	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it vividly shows that Saeng deeply desires to take the test again. However, she wishes to retake the test precisely when all the good and happy elements return, just like the revival of the plant and the return of the geese. This is clearly true as Saeng explicitly says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This statement not only showcases her maturity but also her profound sense of happiness. She is willing to undertake something difficult and perhaps not very enjoyable when everything around her has returned to a state of happiness. Just as she arrived in a state of sadness, when the geese return and the plant thrives, she wants to assist them through this and bring happiness to them as well. In this way, they can all experience happiness simultaneously, creating a harmonious and fulfilling atmosphere."
1582	10450	4	3	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with the main character Saeng, firmly promising herself that in the spring, when the geese gracefully return and the winter hibiscus begins to delicately bud, she would re - take her failed driver's test. Minfong Ho skillfully writes this story, incorporating heavy imagery and symbolism. The hibiscus found in the floral shop represents a deep - seated connection for Saeng to her homeland. The bittermelon, which is loved by Saeng but unbearable to the people in @LOCATION1, represents Saeng's arduous time in connecting with the people there. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus and the returning geese are powerful symbols of a new opportunity to pass her driver's test and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1. This ending not only provides hope but also shows the potential for growth and integration in a new environment.
1583	10451	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to clearly show that Saeng doesn't give up easily and that nature bestows significant strength upon @CAPS1. The conclusion effectively demonstrates that Saeng doesn't give up by stating that she is determined to take the test again, even though she unfortunately failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by emphasizing that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return in their graceful flight, when the hibiscus buds with its beautiful blossoms, and when the snow melts in the gentle spring. Nature gives her strength because it vividly reminds her of where they used to live and her beloved grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to firmly establish that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature provides her with the strength and confidence needed to face challenges and move forward in life.
1584	10452	4	3	The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had unfortunately failed her driver's test and still deeply missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her significant changes. She used to feel awkward and out of place. Many things were new and unfamiliar to her. But as the story progresses, Saeng realizes that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the “winter hibiscus” represented her change as well. It showed how she will start anew and continue her life happily. Saeng will “plant a new seed,” symbolizing a fresh start and a positive outlook. The ending was well - chosen for the story because it effectively foreshadows Saeng's future, filled with the promise of growth and adaptation. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to this inspiring effect, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future.
1585	10453	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly show how Saeng closely relates the hibiscus' overcoming of problems to her own journey of overcoming problems. Saeng is making a direct comparison of the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can successfully adapt to its surroundings, then she firmly believes that she can do the same. And if the hibiscus can make it through the harsh winter, then she too is confident that she can make it through her difficulties; and she will re - take the test that she failed before. Also, before this realization, she mentions that things that were once strange to her now seem familiar, like the geese. She then sees them overhead flying in a perfect V - formation. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng realizes that just like the geese, she too can adapt to her new environment and overcome the challenges she faces. This connection between nature and her own situation gives her the motivation and courage to move forward.
1586	10454	4	3	The author concludes the story with that sentence, because she is extremely excited for spring to come back. She eagerly anticipates the opportunity to plant more things and delightfully watch them bloom and come alive.
1587	10455	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it clearly shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng unfortunately failed her driver's test and as she was slowly walking home, she unexpectedly found a hibiscus. It vividly reminded her of her old home. Saeng then went to the greenhouse or flower shop and carefully bought one. When she returned, she gently planted the hibiscus. The hibiscus is steadfastly keeping her from giving up. When it starts budding, @PERSON1 will bravely take the test again.
1588	10456	4	3	"The author chose that paragraph to put at the end because that is precisely when everything will be perfect for her to redo her mistake. Saeng said, crying, ""I - I failed the test!"" @CAPS1 clearly means she failed at what she thought she was good at. ""Here, let me help mother,"" she said, getting up and firmly taking the shovel away from her mother. Saeng is diligently trying to get better at gardening so when she does redo her mistake, she will surely do better. As the reader can clearly see, Saeng wants to pass the test so she can whole - heartedly believe she is a great gardener like her mother."
1589	10457	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it effectively makes people want to read the next story to see how she performs on the test. In the story, she failed the test. Now that she has changed, she is determined to retake the test because she knows she can do better now than before.
1590	10458	4	3	Cause everything that is in this paragraph is present in the story somewhere. So it really neatly intertwines together. She gradually learns to adapt to her new homeland, just as the plant slowly adapts to its new environment. This parallel shows the resilience and growth in both her and the plant.
1591	10459	4	3	I would say that the author concluded this story with that paragraph because they wanted to be very consistent. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and a clear understanding of the text. In brief words, it was a well - thought - out way to end the story for the sake of the reader's comprehension.
1592	10460	4	3	The reason why they include the story within the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together as a team. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together, which further emphasizes their close - knit bond.
1593	10461	4	3	The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring, it is clearly showing she is confident and is looking forward to a new beginning to come then. Also, he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didn't have much self - confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew her mother was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and persevere until she passed the test, which shows her growing determination.
1594	10462	4	3	I think when she takes the test over, it is going to be in the spring and she is going to try her best and pass it. But she did not want to cry in front of her mother as she wanted to show her strength. I think she is going to make it up to her mother and pass the test, proving her resilience.
1595	10463	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show the readers she was knocked down but she is going to get back up again and take the test again. This is also a very good way to end the story because it shows she is very determined to pass that test and won't give up easily and will do anything within her power to pass it, leaving a strong and inspiring impression on the readers.
1596	10464	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is clearly showing that she is a tenacious individual who will not give up easily. She firmly believes that she will do it when she is truly ready to. The reason I say this is quite evident as she is choosing to do the test when she wants to, precisely when she feels completely comfortable. These are the solid reasons I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph, as it effectively portrays her unwavering spirit.
1597	10465	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story like this to vividly show an exemplary instance of perseverance. Saeng states, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This poignant statement represents her process of adjusting to change. Gradually, she will adjust fully to her new home; it just requires time. If she keeps persevering steadfastly, she will surely make it. In the last paragraph, Saeng says, “when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Just as the seasons bring things back in a cyclical manner, she will come back with renewed determination. I believe this last paragraph was put in to powerfully show that everyone should persevere because things just take time to fall into place.
1598	10466	4	3	This statement clearly shows what the author concludes about the story. It truly reveals the theme of the story. The message is that if you fail, then you should try again. This is precisely what the statement is saying. She failed her tasks, so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again vibrantly, she will bravely attempt to complete her task. The statement also strongly concludes how you should never give up. Saeng had failed the test. She said, “I - I failed the test.” This clearly shows how sad and depressed she was because the tone in which the statement was said was a notably sadder and more depressed tone. Even though she was sad and depressed, Saeng knows that next year she will resolutely attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence effectively shows what the author concludes and thinks about the story “Winter Hibiscus”.
1599	10467	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” for several well - thought - out reasons. First, Saeng decides that she is deeply determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saeng’s mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through,” and Saeng firmly decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test with flying colors. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to subtly tie in the fact that she is getting used to her new surroundings because the geese “sound familiar.” As much as she misses her old home, she is gradually adapting to her new environment. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she’s starting to get used to her new country and she clearly recognizes that she is part of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her future will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again with a new sense of purpose.
1600	10468	4	3	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is trying to tell the reader a profound message. The author is trying to say that if a plant can make it through the harsh cold winter and still thrive, then she can surely pass her driver’s test. The plant endures the cold, just as she endures the disappointment of failure. That is why I think the author included that paragraph, to inspire the reader with this powerful comparison and the message of resilience.
1601	10469	4	3	I think the author ended the story like that because she truly enjoys watching the graceful geese flying in the sky and she deeply loves the vibrant beauty of the spring. Moreover, she has a strong desire to take the test and successfully pass it. She is diligently studying for it in the meantime to achieve her goal.
1602	10470	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author firmly feels that Saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus by her side. She thinks that way because the hibiscus has a certain unique charm about it. Additionally, it also gives her vivid memories of the place where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place as she was at a loss and did not know what to do.
1603	10471	4	3	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is steadily building and that she will take the test again. She firmly believes that she will perform better when the cold and gloomy snow is finally gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was extremely upset after failing a test, but with the comforting presence of the hibiscus, she'll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng regarding the test, providing a sense of closure.
1604	10472	4	3	He concludes the story like that because the test was the main focal point that he was consistently talking about throughout the narrative. It was the central event around which the story revolved, so ending the story in relation to the test helps to tie up the loose ends and give a sense of finality.
1605	10473	4	3	"In the end of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator describes her strong - felt desire to take and this time pass the driver's test she failed earlier in the day. She ""vowed silently to herself"" with determination that she would succeed at something she had failed at in the past. This is an important concluding message, because it clearly shows that the author will overcome obstacles in her future. Most of the story is about the profound sadness that the narrator experiences because of her intense longing for her homeland. Saeng misses her kind - hearted grandmother and the beautiful, familiar plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to constantly remind her of her beloved homeland. She is also not enjoying @LOCATION2, because she has already faced the disappointment of failure at her new home. However, the end of the story provides a stark contrast to this, for Saeng vows to succeed in the future, offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise somber tale."
1606	10474	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it vividly shows how much the main character, Saeng, has grown. As she observes the delicate hibiscus, she realizes that if this flower can endure rough times, she too has the strength to persevere. The fight for survival in nature closely mirrors Saeng's struggle in a new place. Over time, she discovers that one will gradually adapt to their surroundings. Eventually, after this period of adjustment, it will feel just like home. The principle of adaptation is evident throughout the story, whether demonstrated by nature or a child's life. Therefore, the author would whole - heartedly agree that the conclusion of the story effectively illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng, highlighting her transformation and newfound resilience.
1607	10475	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng, a newcomer to @LOCATION1, is deeply missing her home. One day, while passing by a flower shop, she catches sight of a hibiscus. Immediately, a sense of nostalgia washes over her. After purchasing the flower, she takes it home and plants it in her backyard. With determination in her eyes, she decides that the next time she'll take the driver's test is when the hibiscus starts budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it beautifully relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus serves as a precious connection to her old home in Vietnam. The ending symbolizes that if the flower can survive the cold winter, she can overcome the challenges in this new place too. Taking the driver's test will be a powerful sign of her survival and ability to overcome obstacles. The overall theme of this story is that everything will get better with time. Saeng will gradually adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom vibrantly, and Saeng will successfully pass her driver's test, marking her new beginning in this unfamiliar land.
1608	10476	4	3	They ended the story this way because the girl is incredibly determined and not going to give up easily. She is going to keep putting in the effort at this test and won't stop at just one attempt. With each try, she will become a little brighter, more confident, and more knowledgeable. Eventually, she will pass this test. Passing the test is not just about her own achievement; it also means she won't disappoint her mother, who has been supporting her. Once she passes, she will be able to take this burden off her shoulders and move forward with a sense of relief and accomplishment, starting a new chapter in her life.
1609	10477	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph in order to help the reader vividly visualize a brand - new beginning for the girl. It presents a time when she can re - take the test, with the fresh new flowers blooming around her, adding a touch of hope and beauty to the situation. As the geese return, it becomes a powerful symbol for her and the journey she has embarked on towards her new home. The combination of the melting snow, which represents the end of a difficult period, and the budding flowers, which signify new growth, clearly lets the reader know of the bright, fresh, and unclaimed future that awaits the girl. The author uses this paragraph at the end to not only explain more about what is to come but also to enhance the illustrations and capture the attention of the audience. It shows a resilient spirit in the girl. Just like the flower that has trouble rooting in new soil, she is having difficulty grasping onto the new lifestyle. However, there is always going to be a fresh and new time for her to continue on her journey, with optimism and the promise of a better future.
1610	10478	4	3	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story perhaps because it holds the significance of a good - luck charm or is part of a long - standing tradition. In many cultures, certain symbols or events are associated with good fortune, and this might be the case here. It is very important that it is included in the story as it adds depth and cultural context. Also, it could be trying to convey a hidden message to us. Maybe it implies that she only takes tests in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding, suggesting a connection between the natural cycle of the flower and her own personal growth and readiness to face challenges. This connection gives the story an extra layer of meaning, making it more engaging and thought - provoking.
1611	10479	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that special paragraph in order to conclude Saeng’s game of wanting to be home but also to show that she is learning to overcome obstacles. Saeng wishes that she were in her homeland and keeps referring to it because she wants it back. “I mean, it’s not like the one we had at - at -,” Saeng continues to stumble because she doesn’t wish to mention home as it brings her to tears. In addition, when she mentions the “test,” it makes her buy a fake test. “It’s - it’s not a real one.” She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is. The test refers to both the plant and the driver’s test. Saeng also ends with this vow because the flower represents hope to her, “... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test.” The emotional test of both of the situations she is in will allow her to be stronger. This vow at the end of the story shows her willingness to be strong and come through in the end, indicating her growth and resilience in the face of difficulties.
1612	10480	4	3	In the story, the author concludes that after she's done her test and there's nothing left to see, she'll grow more as she reflects on the experience and uses it as an opportunity for self - improvement. This growth might manifest in various aspects of her life, such as in her emotional maturity or her ability to handle future challenges. It shows that even in the face of what might seem like a lack of immediate results, there is still potential for personal development.
1613	10481	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of those details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. Nature provides a source of comfort and inspiration for the girl after her setback. In the story, the connection between the girl and nature is a key element, highlighting how nature can offer solace and a different perspective. That is what it is mainly about in the story, emphasizing the therapeutic and meaningful role of nature in the girl's life.
1614	10482	4	3	I am guessing the author adds this paragraph to tell the reader that when all of the beauty returns, like the blooming of flowers or the return of a pleasant season, she will try to get used to new things again. This implies that the period of lacking beauty was a time of struggle or adjustment. Once the beauty is back, it gives her the courage and motivation to embrace the new and unfamiliar, suggesting that beauty and positivity can be catalysts for personal change and adaptation.
1615	10483	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a powerful reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong. She compares herself to the geese, saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter, the hibiscus doesn't bloom and Saeng fails her driver’s test, depicting a time of hardship and disappointment. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the hibiscus thrives and the geese return, it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well. This new start offers hope for Saeng to overcome her past failures and fully adapt to her new life, marking a turning point in her journey.
1616	10484	4	3	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to vividly show Saeng’s strong determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test, her mother could clearly sense that it was extremely hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent and somewhat tense moment, her mother quickly realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea at all. Saeng is kind of subtly comparing herself to the plant. She might have thought, if this plant can make it through the harsh winter and still keep growing vigorously, then she can surely make it through the difficult test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did, to emphasize Saeng's indomitable spirit.
1617	10485	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has newly found hope and a firm determination. The author deeply loves and greatly admires the hibiscus; for example, when her mother says, “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”. Saeng earnestly wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the resilient hibiscus can. She is completely filled with new resolution when she firmly says to herself, “Then I will take the test again.” This ending shows how the hibiscus has inspired her to face challenges bravely.
1618	10486	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was steadily leading to it. All the events and details in the story were building up to this point. And the story would have been utterly pointless if it wasn't for this meaningful conclusion. This conclusion ties together all the loose ends and gives the story a proper sense of closure.
1619	10487	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to clearly show that Saeng is going to gradually adapt to the conditions of her new life. The hibiscus is a delicate plant that typically thrives in warm, tropical climates. However, it usually does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which has the remarkable ability to survive in both climates (warm and cold), can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She once lived in Vietnam and loved it whole - heartedly with all the pretty flowers and the precious time being with her grandmother. However, now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it quite hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can draw inspiration from it and adjust to her new life in the United States. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summer, she will take the driving test because they are giving her area another chance of being their home for the season. This is why the author ends the story with this paragraph, highlighting Saeng's potential for adaptation.
1620	10488	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the thick snow gradually melts and the lush greenery slowly returns, like a beautiful and profound rebirth. This vividly similizes his renewed motivation to take the test again. This really shows how closely he is connected to nature and the significant effect that his long - term exposure to it has had on him over the years. The natural cycle of renewal has rekindled his inner drive, making this conclusion a fitting end to the story.
1621	10489	4	3	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful, vivid picture in your head with nearly every sentence. So why not end it with a paragraph like, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now, tell me that wasn't a truly beautiful way to end the story.
1622	10490	4	3	The author put the last sentence the way it did. It meant that by next spring, they want to see how they will react differently to the same situation. They already know what it is like, but they also know how to better react to the season, which shows a growth in their understanding and adaptation.
1623	10491	4	3	He uses this line at the end of the story because it shows she has another chance to pass the test. They use the plant because a plant will always come back and bud again, symbolizing hope and renewal. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows that in the present, plants in @MONTH1 can be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something positive. And maybe this is how she communicates with her mother through the plants, finding comfort and guidance in their presence.
1624	10492	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” they end the story with that paragraph because it represents that she is getting used to the new country. She is also telling you that you need to adapt to new circumstances, just like facing new winds. That’s why I think they ended with that paragraph, as it encapsulates the theme of adaptation and resilience.
1625	10493	4	3	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story, she explains that they vividly remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of the plant and spring represent new life, a fresh start. Saeng thinks that spring could also bring a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will perform better and pass the test. But, if she fails again, the flowers will have bloomed to offer her comfort and solace, just as they have always done.
1626	10494	4	3	The author concludes with that because she kind of closely relates herself to the flowers. She has gradually grown accustomed to her environment, much like a flower adapting to its surroundings. Also, she had unfortunately failed her test. So, just like when a flower withers and then comes back to life, she is going to come back with determination and try the test again to achieve success.
1627	10495	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test. So, over the winter, they don't get hibiscus as it's not in season. But over the spring when they get hibiscus again, she will try to take the test again so that she can pass it and move forward.
1628	10496	4	3	The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of two main reasons. One of them is that the flower is almost like her in essence; the flower wasn't bloomed initially. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms, she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out by passing the test. Another reason is that it reminds her of back home, and her mother understands why she paid so much for it. So, they want to take good care of it as it holds special meaning.
1629	10497	4	3	Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus”, concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her driver's test in the spring when the geese fly back and plants rebud. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to clearly signify Saeng’s strong willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a greenhouse and deeply misses her old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and carefully plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the winter. The plant signifies her precious memories. When she first sees it, it’s blossomed beautifully. In the spring, it will rebud and form another lovely blossom while growing bigger. This parallels Saeng getting over her sadness and homesickness and rebuilding better memories while growing stronger. When she gets the chance. The birds flying overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold. In spring, they will return to start over, raise goslings, rebuild their home, and start anew from last spring. Saeng is planning to start over and pass the test so she can drive and feel more fully accepted in @LOCATION2. Minfong Ho chose to end the story with this paragraph to effectively signify the character’s starting over and rebuilding good memories.
1630	10498	4	3	The last paragraph in, “Winter Hibiscus,” was added because the author wants to show that she feels really bad because she did not pass the test. She feels extremely disappointed because her mom is disappointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares intently at the Hibiscus and then at the geese flying in the air, she realizes that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year, and she firmly believes she is going to pass it and prove herself.
1631	10499	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He does so because that's how the girl feels. She believes that in the spring, she can perform better than what she did before. This conclusion effectively captures the girl's hopeful outlook.
1632	10500	4	3	It means that she wants to start afresh and do it all over again. It's the girl's comfort zone - so whenever she gets upset, that's what she does. That is precisely what the story and the phase signify.
1633	10501	4	3	"The author concluded ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to convey to the reader the message of never giving up and to keep persevering. It also conveys that family is always there, as one can't achieve things alone. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng - noi"", she finally said, highlighting the significance of nature in this moment of determination."
1634	10502	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is trying to show the reader that she realized she cares deeply about nature and loves it. Since she is waiting for the spring, and as soon as the spring arrives, she will take the test again. So, in my opinion, the author wants to show the readers that the character in the story has a great appreciation for the beauty of nature, which gives her the motivation to face challenges.
1635	10503	4	3	The author concludes the story with the sentence saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because the hibiscus serves as a good - luck charm. When it's not there, things don't seem right, but when it comes back, things take a turn for the better. Also, the author concludes this way because the good - luck charm of the hibiscus gives her more confidence. When one speaks with real confidence, they are more likely to succeed. This ending of the story lets the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope, and this will ultimately help her do well.
1636	10504	4	3	The author concludes the story that way because one key theme is the ability to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus, a vibrant and resilient flower, represents Saeng's unwavering perseverance. The last paragraph effectively offers closure to the conflict that was initially introduced. The statement “the hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months here… that is what matters” clearly makes a connection between the plant and the author's perseverance due to the powerful symbolism. The last paragraph further adds this symbolism along with closure as she firmly says she'll wait until spring to take the test again, showing her determination to face the challenge anew.
1637	10505	4	3	Saeng is trying to convey that when the appropriate time comes again, she will bravely take the test. The author concludes the story with this element because it leaves the reader naturally wondering about what will unfold the next time she takes the test. The author also does this to vividly show that one should never quit. Just as the flower can survive the harsh winter, Saeng will be able to overcome the difficulties of that test. Additionally, the author is suggesting that when the seasons change, circumstances change. She was on the verge of giving up because she failed the test, but then she saw that plant enduring through the harsh weathers, and that sight gave her a significant boost of confidence. Moreover, she deeply cherished the plant because she eagerly wants to see it budding as she and her mother spent precious quality time caring for this plant, creating a special bond. In conclusion, this connection between Saeng, the plant, and the test showcases her new - found resolve.
1638	10506	4	3	Saeng is actively talking about her school work and the garden. She consistently connects the two of them in a similar way. She clearly knows that she has to diligently study while the garden gradually grows. She has a strong desire to water the delicate flowers. She is also saying that when the beautiful spring arrives, she won't be physically present for the garden as she will have to take the important test. In summary, Saeng sees a parallel between the growth of the garden and her academic progress.
1639	10507	4	3	The author ended the story that way to vividly show that Saeng won't give up and is highly determined to complete her task. The author sincerely wants the reader to understand that Saeng is very sad and is longing to overcome being homesick. Saeng is strikingly like the hibiscus plant; she's both frail in her vulnerability and beautiful in her spirit. Saeng says with determination that she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost as if she's growing and maturing along with the plant. This connection between Saeng and the hibiscus emphasizes her journey of resilience and hope.
1640	10508	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it clearly shows that everything and everyone has the potential to make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final, heart - warming positive message to readers. The text states, “when they come back... I will take that test again”. This powerful quote shows that Saeng can envision herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She clearly knows that her “winter” is her test and that when she is fully ready, she'll be able to take the test again and achieve success. The budding of the hibiscus precisely represents the time when she'll be well - prepared to take the test. Though she is currently having a tough time, she'll be able to persevere and make another earnest attempt. This paragraph is strategically placed at the end because it effectively brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without including this, the readers would have never grasped this profound message. Instead, they would wrongly believe that the role of the hibiscus was merely to serve as a connection to Saeng's past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to convincingly show readers that everyone can bounce back from a bad situation and emerge stronger.
1641	10509	4	3	One possibility it could mean is that she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that particular period were so relaxing to her. When she was disappointed and frustrated @CAPS1 about her failing grade in the driving test.. she found solace in the thought of waiting for the spring to retake it.
1642	10510	4	3	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 because she truly cared deeply about the hibiscus. She said this because she was making a direct comparison between her test and the hibiscus. When the hibiscus starts budding, she firmly believes she will take the test again. The hibiscus is everything to her; it is her symbol of good luck. And with the hibiscus budding, she can embark on a new life. Without the hibiscus plant, she was constantly repeating “I failed the test” and “I bought it,” Saeng answered while reading her mother’s next question. She was so deeply depressed about failing the test that's why she bought the hibiscus to positively influence her life. She decided that when spring arrives with the hibiscus budding, she will start her new life by giving the test again and proving to herself how important the hibiscus is to her journey.
1643	10511	4	3	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus, and her mother was getting extremely mad at her. Saeng’s mother was mad because she spent a significant amount of money on the whole pre - grown plant instead of planting it from seeds, which would have been a lot cheaper. When her mother was in a state of anger and disbelief, Saeng started crying uncontrollably, and seeing her daughter's distress, the mother forgave her for her actions. This simple yet impactful incident shows that in the story, as in life, anything can happen, defying our initial expectations.
1644	10512	4	3	The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to clearly show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can’t be stubborn and give up. So, Saeng failed her driver's test, but she didn't let that setback define her. In the spring, when the hibiscus plant starts to bud, she will go back with renewed determination and take the test again. By the plant budding, she whole - heartedly thinks of that as a positive sign that she will pass the test and move forward in her life.
1645	10513	4	3	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to vividly show the reader that she will grow just like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time with unwavering determination to pass it. The plant gives Saeng a glimmer of hope because it serves as a powerful reminder of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and blooming with beautiful flowers, Saeng will “bud” too, metaphorically speaking, and gain her long - awaited driver's license, marking a new chapter in her life.
1646	10514	4	3	I think that the passage is trying to convey the significance of the sum because, within the passage, it clearly states “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun can cause that, and the geese return during hunting season and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. Evidently, the events start in the spring. So, it has to be the influence of the sun in the spring time that sets the stage for these occurrences. This indicates that the passage is emphasizing the importance of the spring season and the sun's role in bringing about a new phase.
1647	10515	4	3	The author used the paragraph telling about how Saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because the carefully - chosen words and the way the paragraph is written can effectively tell the reader that Saeng has reached a state of peace and fully accepts the fact that she lives in the U.S. When Saeng says, “and this hibiscus plant is budding,” she is deeply thinking about how the plant serves as a poignant reminder of her native country. Also, when she says, “Then I will take this test again,” she is firmly promising herself that she will take the test when she truly feels at home in her new country. Saeng is, in a meaningful way, telling herself that she should accept the reality that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country through the new hibiscus plant and many other things. This acceptance and determination mark a positive shift in her mindset.
1648	10517	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author has the option to write a sequel to this one. She might want the readers to keep coming back for more engaging stories, or perhaps she wants people to know that when the natural cycle restarts, just like the plant and the geese, Saeng will also restart her journey. Ending the story with that paragraph is indeed a very wise thing to do. The author wants the readers to understand that when the plant and geese begin their new lives, Saeng will follow suit. She will not give up but instead bravely re - take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves the readers in deep thought, and then the sequel will likely be about the start of Saeng’s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring, so will Saeng. The author truly loves having people wonder about what’s coming next. The readers will go home and keep wondering what the author will do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting eagerly for an answer, which adds an element of mystery to the story.
1649	10518	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to strongly emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the numerous obstacles and adapt well to her new life. The hibiscus vividly discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng’s new - found hope and strong determination to succeed in the United States. For example, in the text it states, “… its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to connect her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was completely overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents new hope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has fully blossomed, her world will be wide open and a new life will be eagerly waiting to begin. With this thought clearly realized at the end of the story, the reader can easily understand that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually achieve success. In addition, in the text it says, “it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.” Saeng’s past memories could be vividly reached when this hibiscus was present, and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng’s new recollection and hope to firmly prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world, which gives the story a positive and hopeful ending.
1650	10519	4	3	The author concluded the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to vividly portray to her reader that even though Saeng was going through the hardship of leaving her old home behind, she could still build a good life with a new beginning here. In the final paragraph, the winter clearly shows the hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future and a brand - new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the loss of her past, she could still find happiness in her new surroundings. In the story, she once knew hibiscus from her old home. She finds hibiscus where she is now, and it is a beautiful semblance and a powerful reminder of her old home. Also, the story says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote smoothly leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can happily live in this new home. The final paragraph says, “… when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” When things familiar to her and things that remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the inner strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again, which showcases her resilience and positive outlook.
1651	10520	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it clearly shows that you can always start afresh. You should never give up when you really want something. The driver really wanted to pass the test, so she worked hard day and night. But unfortunately, she failed it. She knows, just like the plant, spring will offer a new beginning in life. And you can always change something you don't like about yourself. I strongly agree with this statement because if you didn't have a second chance, most people would all be losers. Everyone makes mistakes in their life, and everyone has the opportunity to fix them. This is why I believe the author concludes with this statement at the end of the story, as it imparts an important life lesson.
1652	10521	4	3	The story ends with that paragraph because Saeng firmly believes that next spring, when her new hibiscus is born, she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is indeed a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the driver's test. Now she believes that on her next driving test, she will have the connection to her past experiences, the ability to overcome obstacles with more determination, and the comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can surely help her pass the test, making the ending both meaningful and hopeful.
1653	10522	4	3	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason might be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story, the author sounds extremely discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph, it clearly shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. “Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too, yet they come back every year. Along with the flower, Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring, and that is what she must do. She won't give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is gradually adapting and changing to work with her new surroundings, which is a key take - away from the story.
1654	10523	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to clearly demonstrate Saeng's determination to not only pass her driving test but also to accommodate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express a strong positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is steadily adapting to her new lifestyle. Yet, he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time to fully settle in and be at ease in her new environment.
1655	10524	4	3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng made a solemn promise to herself that she would never fail the test again. Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland, which is precisely why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story, she vows, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She says this because she wants to move on now and make a sincere effort to get used to her new home, leaving behind the disappointment of the past test failure.
1656	10525	4	3	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas presented throughout the narrative are effectively brought together, creating a cohesive whole. This ending also serves to show that Saeng is ready for what's ahead. When they place the flower, they are not only concluding the flower's importance within the story but also highlighting how it relates to the girl's emotional state, whether she is happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and that she'd take the test again, she is clearly stating that she is ready for what lies ahead. Moreover, she will be open - minded to new experiences so that she can reflect on how far she has come. Therefore, the author ends with that paragraph to leave a sense of mystery about what happened next and to conclude the overall themes of the story.
1657	10526	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is winter now, and the once - vibrant flowers are gone. However, during the time when she was planting those flowers, she grew more mature. As it clearly says in the text, things she used to think were strange are now becoming familiar, and she's gradually getting the hang of things. This is because she is learning more about her new environment and the challenges it presents. Consequently, she will be ready for the test that awaits her next spring, as her growth and newfound understanding will serve her well.
1658	10527	4	3	The author uses this as an ending paragraph in the story because the next year at the very same time, she will take the test of life over again. This implies that she has learned from her past experiences and is willing to face the challenges anew. It shows her resilience and determination, suggesting that despite any setbacks, she is ready to embrace the opportunities that the new year may bring.
1659	10528	4	3	"The ending of a story plays a crucial role in determining the meaning of the entire narrative. It serves as the final closure, and more often than not, it is the part that will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with a paragraph filled with encouragement. The conclusion strongly encourages the reader to keep trying, as it states that next year when the flower blooms, Saeng will re - take the test. This clearly shows encouragement because Saeng has the strong drive to try again and to finally pass. The author ends with this feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is not only strong but also seems to recap the story's core meaning. All along, Saeng keeps getting disappointed about the flower, her mother, and her homeland, yet they encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was truly meaningful and effectively showed what the author was truly trying to convey."
1660	10529	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character is deeply troubled because they have moved away from their home. The culture, customs, and even the food in the new place are vastly different. Therefore, the main character faces significant difficulty in adapting to her new environment. The author concludes the ending statement to clearly show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again to see if, over time, things in the new place have changed. The story is highly emotional, expressing a great deal of sorrow that the main character experiences due to the separation from her homeland. However, this sorrow is ultimately overcome in the end, leaving a message of hope and perseverance.
1661	10530	4	3	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to clearly show that Saeng is going to earnestly try to overcome her obstacles. She was extremely disappointed in failing the test, so she sought comfort in vivid memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she often saw in her homeland, and that flower brought her comfort and affection. But it also symbolized her ability to surmount obstacles. While she was carefully planting her hibiscus and saw the geese gracefully flying above, she firmly knew she had to try again and face her challenges head - on.
1662	10531	4	3	The author says this because she is determined to start her own garden anew. Her previous garden didn't turn out very well. In the book, it specifically mentions that she needed her mom's help to even attempt it. Despite the setback, she is still eager to give it another try and make her garden a success.
1663	10532	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng finally realizes that she can deeply miss her old home, but she needs to actively adapt to the new place that she is in. Saeng misses the precious old memories of her homeland, as described by the line “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” But, she gradually begins to notice that not everything has changed; some things are still familiar. “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, the faint honks clear and – yes – familiar to Saeng now.” When Saeng realizes that not everything has changed, she gains the inner strength to continue her new life in her new country with more confidence.
1664	10533	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a very fitting way to end the story. At the end of this part, they were talking about how Saeng would come back when the snow melts and then she will bravely take the test again. This ending gives a sense of hope and determination, showing that Saeng is not defeated by her previous failure.
1665	10534	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the beautiful spring, when the snows completely melt and the geese gracefully return and this hibiscus is starting to bud; then I will surely take that test again. The author concludes this story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because in the story it's mainly about Saeng, who fails her driver's test and then notices a familiar plant which leads her to a florist shop. As Saeng learns more about this familiar plant, it strongly encourages her to retake that driver's test, as if the snow is gone and the warm sun is shining. The author concludes the story this way to clearly show that Saeng still has firm hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a great deal of homesickness, missing her beloved grandmother and precious keepsakes from her childhood. The peak of her homesickness is clearly seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” Saeng is initially uncomfortable living in the new place and wishes to go back to Vietnam. But by the end, Saeng’s attitude changes from deep despair to bright hope. Even though she has failed her driver’s test, Saeng is determined and hopeful to achieve at least something in this new country by saying “...then I will take the test again.” Saeng has changed a great deal within this story and that significant change in attitude is clearly seen with the excerpt on geese in the last paragraph.
1666	10537	4	3	I think he put this in here because, in my view, he's trying to convey that when the snow melts, one should simply forget about the first time. And when the geese return, it's your @NUM1 chance. Then, when the hibiscus starts budding, it means you've managed to get past what you were trying to do, moving forward with a fresh perspective.
1667	10538	4	3	This author concludes the story with this paragraph because both characters were talking about the cold or the weather and the @CAPS1. So, it stated that when the snows melt, as it relates to the ongoing conversation about the weather or the @CAPS1, it ties into the overall theme presented in the story.
1668	10539	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because it clearly shows how the main character has been affected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story, we learn that the main character has failed her driver’s test, which was a significant set - back for her. Also, in the story, she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, and her mother was extremely shocked about this expense. At that point, the reader would naturally expect her to be very sad and depressed. However, because of her grandmother and her homeland's influence, she instead surprises the reader by looking on the bright side of things. She says that when the flower blooms again, she will take the test again. This shows a strong connection between the main character and the plant, almost giving the plant a human - like existence, symbolizing hope and new beginnings.
1669	10540	4	3	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to clearly illustrate the overall message of the story. That paragraph effectively sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, where she struggles to make things grow, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings, dealing with cultural differences and new daily routines, and she never gave up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she truly shows her unwavering determination and how she's not afraid to face and overcome the obstacles that will come her way, inspiring the reader with her positive attitude."
1670	10541	4	3	The author of this story concludes the story this way because instead of absorbing all the pain, the main character can look into the future. Also, by looking into the future, she can forget about the past failures and disappointments and try better in the future. This approach allows her to move forward with a renewed sense of purpose and hope, making the story end on an optimistic note.
1671	10542	4	3	The author concludes the story with this piece because she described, “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear in the crisp air.” I think she means that even though the geese flew over with their heads held up high, even though Saeng’s was not. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She means she will not keep her head down and will be grateful for her new home, and with time, she will adjust. When she looks at her hibiscus, she will recall fond memories but not feel sad. In the end, this symbolizes her hope for a better future.
1672	10543	4	3	There are two reasons why he had concluded the story with this paragraph. The one reason why the author had concluded the story with the paragraph is that Saeng had silently picked up a Winter Hibiscus so that she could have the motivation to pass that driving test. Finally, the last reason why the author had concluded the story with this paragraph is that she wants to try her driving test again so that she can pass it and also be able to drive once she successfully passes it. These two reasons were quite confusing to figure out what the author intended to conclude in the story with that sentence, but they do offer some insight into Saeng's journey.
1673	10544	4	3	I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story is because he wanted to show the longing Saeng had for the geese. The geese, flying freely and with purpose, represented something that Saeng desired. Their presence in the story added a layer of symbolism, highlighting Saeng's own feelings of displacement and hope. By including this detail, the author effectively conveyed Saeng's emotional state and her yearning for a sense of belonging.
1674	10545	4	3	There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line, emphasizing the resilience of the hibiscus and by extension, Saeng herself. When Saeng makes that vow, she's essentially telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story, the author states, “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, but she will eventually adjust to her new home and prevail. When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, it's obvious that subconsciously, she's saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time, and with that time, she will find her place in this new environment.
1675	10546	4	3	In the story Winter Hibiscus when Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. Also in the story, it mentions that in her past childhood, she had seen the same flower in her country. The flower holds a special significance for her, a connection to her homeland. But the next time she takes the driving test, she would like to pass. It shows that she was disappointed because in the story it says that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astonished and yelled at her for a second. Saeng began crying, and her mother then calmed down to show sympathy for her. Now she has the determination to take the test again, driven by her desire to succeed and the memories associated with the flower. With this new - found resolve, she is ready to face the challenge once more.
1676	10547	4	3	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", ended her story with Saeng thinking about the spring because she wanted to make Saeng's future more hopeful. The character Saeng seemed deeply depressed and was always reminiscent of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers, she ""broke down and wept"", and she vividly remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make matters even worse for Saeng, she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a huge disappointment. By this point in the story, I truly felt sorry for Saeng and I wondered if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved, with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her home in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, Saeng suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and says, ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” This shift shows that there's a glimmer of hope even in difficult times."
1677	10548	4	3	The concluding paragraph to the story “Winter Hibiscus” gives a strong sense of hope for the future. The girl, Saeng, has just failed her driving test and is feeling extremely depressed. Through a series of events, such as seeing the flowers and reflecting on her situation, her depression gradually leaves her and she starts to feel hope. “Then I will take that test again.” This final sentence clearly shows Saeng's determination. She was deeply upset about leaving her home and she was also very disappointed about failing her test, but thanks to a simple flower, she managed to get her confidence back. Whenever someone is upset, it is very easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is quite depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a bright light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem almost impossible, something small can be the key to lifting your spirits. There is always a positive aspect in a negative situation, you just have to look carefully for it.
1678	10549	4	3	In guessing that it means that when it's winter or spring, it becomes much harder to grow that garden. Also, maybe it's a significant challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that specific time of year. For instance, the cold temperatures in winter or the unpredictable weather in spring could pose difficulties. So I would assume that's what it's talking about with it, indicating that growing a garden during these seasons requires extra effort and patience.
1679	10550	4	3	The author includes that sentence at the end of the story because throughout the story, it was consistently showing courage. The character's journey was filled with moments that highlighted her strength. And that explains her getting better and showing the unwavering courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time. This ending sentence emphasizes the importance of perseverance and the ability to overcome setbacks with courage.
1680	10551	4	3	To me, I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be due to different reasons. To explain, it could mean a new beginning or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and come back, that clearly means that the seasons are changing. So with that being said, the seasons changing or starting over could represent his chance to take the test can start anew, and he will get another opportunity. This conclusion suggests that just as nature renews itself, people can also have fresh starts and second chances in life.
1681	10552	4	3	I think they firmly believe that it will bring them tangible and lasting luck.
1682	10553	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it clearly shows you can overcome something if you have the strong will power. Saeng unfortunately failed the first test. After that, she bought a plant that vividly reminds her of home. She bravely planted the plant despite the cold, hard ground. Eventually, she realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life. Then, she decided to retake the test. Saeng deeply realized that even though you @MONTH1 fail once, you have to keep trying if it is what you truly believe in. She also understood that she will never forget her home but she still can move forward. Finally, Saeng grasped that good things can overcome bad. After she failed the test, she bought the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it summarizes the story perfectly.
1683	10554	4	3	The author includes the excerpt at the end for a meaningful reason related to Saeng. The hibiscus symbolizes everything dear to her, like her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng genuinely feels that if the flower can bloom beautifully, so can she. This belief will enable her to gradually get used to her new home and retake the test. It also strongly resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the harsh winter and bloom in the lovely spring, so can she. The author used this to closely connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower's bloomability.
1684	10555	4	3	The author concludes that statement because the geese typically move south in the cold winter and come back in the warm spring. Similarly, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it when the season of spring arrives. As Saeng fails her driving test and she spots the familiar plant, it means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will surely come back when the right season is approaching. So both the geese and Saeng have a valid reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng's.
1685	10556	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to clearly show how Saeng was not going to give up easily. Throughout the story, she had been feeling quite down. From the moment when she failed the test and she deeply misses Vietnam, so many things in the place where she and her mother live vividly remind her of Vietnam. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair....” This made her very emotional, as she saw how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the overall experience of all this significantly affected her.
1686	10557	4	3	The author chooses to end the story like this to inspire a strong sense of determination within the readers. Saeng obtained the plant as a way to vividly remind her of her beloved homeland and to lift her spirits during difficult times. Once the plant blooms, she feels as if she too will blossom and be fully prepared for the test, ready to face it with newfound courage and resolve.
1687	10558	4	3	The author concluded the passage with a very impactful and powerful statement. “When the geese come back … in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This particular statement clearly shows both renewal and persistence. I think she added this because after observing that the plant can come back time and time again, even after enduring the harsh winter weather, she firmly knew she could do the same. She made a solemn vow to herself that when the day arrives again, she will be ready to renew herself mentally and emotionally and get back on track towards her goal. It also conveys persistence. The plant does not die each season; it is hardy and always comes back. If the girl can be persistent and come back next year to retake the test, she will rightfully be considered persistent. I think the girl wants to be just like the flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing, and truly beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those admirable traits, serving as a constant source of inspiration for her.
1688	10559	4	3	The reason for the author concluding the passage in the following way is because she wants it to be clearly known to the readers that Saeng is not going to simply give up just because she fails the test the first time. She is determined to achieve success so that her mother can be genuinely proud of her and to show herself that she is making a sincere effort. It states that Saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has completely melted and the geese have returned, and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important symbol in the story, it was a very significant part of her life. It helped her move forward and understand how things change over time. It will change, develop, and adapt to the changes around it. Yes, it was a disappointment to her mother, but she sort of understood why Saeng brought the plant home. It might have comforted her in a way. There were probably many different challenges going on where she was; she missed the test and it was not at home. She has to adjust and adapt to the difficult situation that she is in, and the hibiscus serves as a reminder of her resilience.
1689	10560	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test, and next time that time of year comes back around, she will have another valuable chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it specifically states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it, and all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn’t even cost that much. This shows the significance she places on this opportunity. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph, to emphasize Saeng's second chance at success.
1690	10561	4	3	Next year around the winter time when she has to plant things again, she is going to be well - prepared and this time she is going to do it much better. She will use the experience from the previous time to learn from her mistakes and make more informed decisions. With a better understanding of the process, she is confident that she can achieve a more satisfactory outcome, bringing more success and fulfillment to her gardening endeavors.
1691	10562	4	3	The author included this description because she was vividly showing that it was winter. During this cold season, the flower was about to bloom, and the geese were flying here seeking warmer conditions as it is cold in their original habitats. Also, the author said this because the story title is called the “Winter Hibiscus”, which clearly indicates a flower that blooms in the winter. So, that is precisely why I think the author said what she did.
1692	10563	4	3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a specific sentence stating that when Saeng’s Hibiscus’ first bud appears in the spring, she will be back to take the driver's test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because one could wonder what would happen if the plant died. Would she still go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think deeply about this situation. In conclusion, the author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” might have concluded his story in this way to make it somewhat suspenseful, leaving the readers with lingering questions.
1693	10564	4	3	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will surely not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow, she will be growing also as a well - rounded person and thus will be fully ready for the test. The story says, “Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world” (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she received love and support. By seeing all of those plants again, especially the hibiscus, she can draw significant strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her” (Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus, other things will make her ready for the test as well. The story says, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center – just as she had known it would feel” (Ho). The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 reminds Saeng of distant memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test, there is no chance of her failing.
1694	10565	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring, when the snow has completely melted away and the environment becomes more favorable, she will take the test again. This reflects a sense of renewal and a new beginning, where she is ready to face the test with a fresh mindset after the cold and dormant winter.
1695	10566	4	3	In the quote above, it is clearly telling that Saeng is genuinely glad to be back. She has a sense of relief and contentment upon her return. Saeng also states firmly that she would be ready to do it all again if she had to. This shows her determination and resilience, indicating that she is not afraid of challenges and is willing to face them head - on.
1696	10567	4	3	I think the reason the author concluded the story like that is because it was extremely cold outside. The cold weather might have influenced the overall mood and the decisions within the story. I also think that what the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter, the biting cold was present, and she wouldn't take the test until it was warm again due to the harsh cold conditions. “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.” This clearly shows the connection between the weather and her decision.
1697	10568	4	3	There are many reasons the author says “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows completely melt and the geese return in flocks and this hibiscus is budding beautifully, then I will take that test again.” Evidently, the author said this because the girl left everything, her familiar surroundings and all her memories, just to come to this foreign country and she simply cannot afford to fail. The girl said “That at last, she could hold on to. But where was the fine - toothed comb? the hibiscus hedge?” She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother. When the “hibiscus is budding,” it means it is starting a new life and is gradually starting to grow leaves, and similarly, the girl is starting to grow and move on with her life in this new land.
1698	10569	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author tries it again, it might work out a lot better as now they have a clear understanding of what they are doing. They have learned from their previous attempts and can avoid the mistakes. Also, if they try it again, and if it yields enough results, they can sell the product and make a decent amount of money. This way, they will be motivated to keep doing it for years to come, establishing a sustainable and profitable venture.
1699	10570	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to vividly show how Saeng will not give up easily and how she is highly determined. The reference to the spring blossoms in the story shows how Saeng will fight tenaciously to survive through the hardships, which are symbolically represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home environment, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country. The final paragraph provides a clear resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that with her determination, Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus” effectively provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and clearly shows the reader Saeng’s unwavering determination.
1700	10571	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows exactly what Saeng will be doing and whether she will go to school. Saeng didn't want to go to school because she would patiently wait for the snow to completely melt and the geese to return in large numbers and for this hibiscus to be budding vibrantly. She prefers gardening to school as the garden reminds her so much about her homeland. For instance, Saeng dug out a deep hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it with great care. The thing that made her think about her homeland was the rhythmic beating of eggs against a bowl, the sharp sizzle of hot oil in the pan, and the pungent smell of bitter melon that wafted out. Another example is when she went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground with such focus, which shows she deeply cares about the garden and the connection it has to her past.
1701	10572	4	3	The author concludes her story with the quote, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is because the author is showing that nature and the plant are highly valuable to her. Saeng, the one who says the quote, firmly believes that the hibiscus will assist her in passing the test. Earlier on in the story, it vividly shows that when she gets in trouble, she gently rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and effectively portraying the thought that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles, which further emphasizes the connection between Saeng and nature in her journey.
1702	10573	4	3	In the end of the story, the young girl Saeng silently vows to herself that she will take the driver's test next year. One reason she might have vowed to herself to do that is to prove to herself and others that she can successfully pass the test. Also, after she bought the flower and carefully planted it, and as she remembered all the wonderful and precious times she had in Vietnam, it bestowed upon her the confidence to go out and strive for what she truly wanted. This new - found confidence is what propels her to look forward to taking the test next year.
1703	10574	4	3	The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic, aiming for you to know that it is almost an impossible feat for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very clearly sarcastic, which strongly implies that she isn't going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me to take a test and I said, “whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I'll take the test,” that would be a very obvious form of sarcasm. It means that it won't happen and I'm not taking the test, instead of just straightforwardly saying “No.” The author included that just to let you clearly understand that the chances of her taking the test are extremely low. This use of sarcasm effectively conveys the unlikelihood of the event.
1704	10575	4	3	The author includes this paragraph in order to show a proper end to the story and to clearly show that Saeng has not given up. He wanted to vividly illustrate how the plant and the geese represented the continuation of Saeng's life in the United States. The geese will gracefully come back, and the Hibiscus will beautifully bud and flower. Similarly, Saeng will retake and hopefully successfully pass her driving test. This paragraph is not just a simple closing but a new and promising beginning of life for the geese, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng, symbolizing fresh starts and hope.
1705	10576	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show @CAPS1's remarkable strength and the much - needed encouragement. When she is both willing and fully able, she will take the test again with significantly more confidence. Saeng says this to herself as a source of motivation to help her persevere until she can drive. She's looking forward and saying that by next spring, she'll take her test. By next spring, she'll be able to drive independently. By next spring, she'll have fully adjusted to her new home. This paragraph conveys the important message that it takes time to achieve things; you don't always succeed right away, so it's essential to keep trying and stay persistent.
1706	10577	4	3	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was deeply feeling down about not passing her driving test. However, when she saw those beautiful flowers, she realized that ever since she came to @CAPS1, she had gradually forgotten all about her hometown. So, she decided to get back in touch with her nature side and hold off taking her test until the spring instead of rushing things. This way, she could approach the test with a more relaxed and prepared mindset.
1707	10578	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to indicate that she still has hope of finding a sense of home and being truly happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a powerful symbol of home and the happy memories she shared with her grandmother. So, when the plant buds, she will feel as if she is at home again and is filled with happiness. That is precisely when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph clearly shows that she is slowly getting accustomed to the new home and lifestyle. “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Through these vivid examples, I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there to show Saeng's assimilation into her new lifestyle and her acceptance of her situation. This acceptance is a crucial step in her journey towards finding contentment in her new life.
1708	10579	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly show that Saeng did not give up on the test. For example, she firmly says, “I will take the test again.” It shows that she has a strong desire to take the test and successfully pass it. Saeng is patiently going to wait until spring comes and when the snow completely melts to take the test. In the beginning in the box above, it talks about her initial attempt at taking the test. Then it ends with her resolutely going to take the test again, demonstrating her perseverance and determination.
1709	10580	4	3	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author ends the story in such a thoughtful way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her driver's test, Saeng returns home with a heavy heart full of disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck is bound to change. The reader is left with a strong hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass it with flying colors. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is facing in @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United States instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is clearly shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar."" Truly Saeng is a determined character who will surely achieve her goals."
1710	10581	4	3	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph is significant. The story is all about the girl deeply missing her home country. This paragraph subtly implies that the girl will adapt to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph vividly show the girl's remarkable strength to overcome the challenges of leaving her homeland and adjusting to a new environment. This is precisely why the author ended the story with this paragraph, to highlight the girl's resilience and the hope for a brighter future in her new home.
1711	10582	4	3	The author is letting us, the readers, know that the girl plans to do the same thing again next year when the show is all over, when the geese return, and when the weather is warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud and bloom again! In the month of @MONTH1, the author is also concluding the sentence to show that this is the life the little girl chose, and she will continue with her gardening until the next spring.
1712	10584	4	3	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and she feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she will use the plants to overcome her problems. In the month of @MONTH1, she actually passed the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and now believes that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood, which gives her the strength to face challenges.
1713	10585	4	3	She shows that she loves her grandmother and she loves the activities they do together, like gardening and other similar things. Her mother cares about her, but she is really strict with her. This difference in relationships adds complexity to her life, yet she still finds comfort in her bond with her grandmother.
1714	10586	4	3	The author concluded the story in such a way that the reader's eyes are opened. It shows the reader that despite what might happen in the month of @MONTH1, no matter how bad things seem and how hopeless you feel, there is always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. Like the waves on the shore that always try to wash away the sand by coming back again, Saeng is willing to try again, and so should we all, as we can learn from her perseverance.
1715	10587	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that season is over and a new season is starting. This conclusion marks the transition from one phase to another, suggesting that there are new beginnings and opportunities ahead, bringing a sense of hope and renewal to the story.
1716	10588	4	3	"The author concludes the story with  ""when they comes back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". This poignant quote implies that once the flower buds, she will take the test over again. Saeng will have mustered the courage and the will to do it, firmly believing she will pass. The flower represents something deeply personal to her, a source that gives her the motivation and determination to persevere. Everyone has something that motivates them in life to keep going, and for Saeng, it's her plant. The author subtly gives you a direction and an idea of where the story is going, especially when the flower buds, hinting at a positive turn for Saeng."
1717	10589	4	3	"Saeng is not only just disappointed from failing her driver's test; she is also deeply upset and longing for her home of Vietnam. As she is walking home, she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the United States. Intrigued, she buys the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to serve as a tangible reminder of her past. The end of this story masterfully combines the two different countries, cultures, and almost worlds that her life straddles. When she says, ""when they come back"", she is clearly referring to the geese. To her, the geese symbolize her life in the new place and how she has gradually become accustomed to it. The hibiscus is also a powerful symbol of her life. It represents her life and past in Vietnam, and buying that plant was like getting a precious little piece of home. When the ""hibiscus is budding"", it signals that she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home flourishes and gets bigger, it means she will be more settled in the new culture while still having a firm grasp of her own. Then, she will be truly ready to face the challenge once more."
1718	10590	4	3	I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph because I think it is vividly showing that Saeng isn't a quitter. Saeng is eagerly waiting, can't hold back her anticipation until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus finally makes its return, she'll retake the test with newfound determination. She is set on showing her mother that she can do it, proving her capabilities and resilience. This ending indicates that Saeng is ready to overcome the setback and move forward with confidence.
1719	10591	4	3	The reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is that when Saeng saw the geese, she had a clear realization. She knew that when spring comes back around, she would be ready to seek out different flowers. Also, she fondly thinks back to when she was in her homeland, where she could vividly see the flowers growing up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city, she optimistically thinks the flowers will blossom just like the ones back home, which she misses a great deal. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends, a connection that runs deep. She also remembers the “Madagascar periwinkle” growing wild, emerging from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically, the author conveys that she is eager and ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland, rekindling a sense of connection to her roots.
1720	10592	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to vividly depict a significant development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is visibly dejected about failing her driver's test, feeling down and disheartened. However, this ending paragraph portrays the remarkable change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng initially proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2, struggling to fit in. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus, which becomes a symbol of her past and comfort. By ending with the mention of the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“...and this hibiscus is budding...”), the author effectively depicts Saeng's change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver's test with renewed confidence. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng's new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination of the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no prior exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng's mentioning of the creatures displays her growing adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“...when the snow melts and the geese return...”). This shows Saeng's development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and fully embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through, highlighting her growth and resilience. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the significant development in character that Saeng undergoes, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for her future.
1721	10593	4	3	They conclude the story with that because the harsh winter is finally over and the vibrant spring has arrived, and the world will be beautiful again with blooming flowers and chirping birds.
1722	10594	4	3	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” As time passes, she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” That tells me that she feels that over some time, she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she will surely pass it.
1723	10595	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to a foreign location and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her beloved grandmother to the familiar old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the cold winter and bloom in the colorful spring, and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom beautifully, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought in the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows Saeng's new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it.
1724	10596	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng really wants to pass the test. You know this when it says “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” This passage shows that she didn't want to fail. When Saeng got home, she had the white bud in the pot, and her mother saw that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then Saeng took the shovel and did it herself. This made her realize she can take the test again.
1725	10597	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring, that means that the plant is about to burst into full bloom. That also means that Saeng will be well - prepared in the spring to take the test again. Also, the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can survive the tough winter and thrive, then the girl can pass her driver's test and be happy in both the success of the plant and her own achievement.
1726	10598	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because the author is stating that it's going to be a significant year, or some notable change is going to take place. He feels that they could have performed better than what they actually did and is determined to take that test again to achieve a better result.
1727	10599	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the new beginning that Saeng is eagerly looking for. She was extremely disappointed when she failed her driver's test. The hibiscus was the very thing that could make her happy. She desperately needed a new beginning to start afresh in a new country. The flower, the snow, the geese, and the test all symbolize new beginnings and challenges to overcome. The geese and snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus represents new life, and the passing of the test represents a significant milestone in Saeng's life. Ending the story with this paragraph makes the reader expect something new and exciting to unfold in Saeng's life.
1728	10600	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to clearly explain to the reader that she isn't done with gardening. She'll definitely go back when the plants bloom once again. Also, she has no intention of stopping. In fact, she'd much rather spend her time gardening than going to school. This is precisely what the author concludes about the story with the last paragraph.
1729	10601	4	3	The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again.” because she strongly wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something just because she failed once. She is firmly determined to keep going forward until she succeeds in passing “the test” and achieves her desired goal.
1730	10602	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already clearly knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months. Here, this winter hibiscus.” It shows that the mother wants Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficulty. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season…” It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she's living in right now is almost the same as their old home. In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should bravely face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and smoothly follow the flow of life.
1731	10603	4	3	The author concluded this story for an internal adjustment. Saeng's memories are vividly expressed through the one at the hibiscus. Spring, a season where everything is fresh and new, holds great significance. As spring arrives, Saeng's hope would be restored and start thriving, just like the budding hibiscus. And then, she will have the ability to try at the test again with more strength and inspiration, ready to face the challenges ahead.
1732	10604	4	3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, firmly vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is in full bloom. This is a poignant way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up easily. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus in bloom because the hibiscus is a powerful symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is quite common in her home country, and the hibiscus she bought vividly reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is earnestly trying to accept her new lifestyle and uses the hibiscus as a valuable tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower, she makes a firm vow to retake the failed driver's test after spring comes. Spring is a well - known symbol of a fresh start. Saeng also sincerely feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the harsh winter in @LOCATION1, so can she. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of vivid imagery that strongly suggests that Saeng will be strong and continue to build a life in @LOCATION1.
1733	10605	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that Saeng fails the test, and through this experience, she learns to appreciate nature a little better. This realization adds depth to the story, showing that setbacks can lead to personal growth and a newfound connection with the world around her.
1734	10606	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring, perhaps to find the same source of inspiration and comfort. This return symbolizes her perseverance and the hope for a new beginning, suggesting that she will carry on and face future challenges with renewed strength.
1735	10607	4	3	The author states that idea because if you cannot do it once, do it again. First, if you take a test and can't pass it the first time, give it another try and you will likely be able to pass. For example, in the story, Saeng could not pass a test, and it would have been beneficial for them to let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help from others or use a book and study thoroughly. For instance, it will significantly help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. By persevering and seeking assistance, success becomes more attainable. That is what I think the statement means, highlighting the importance of determination and learning from failures.
1736	10608	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because it shows how each year will begin and end, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and experiences.
1737	10609	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been genuinely comforted by the hibiscus and is whole - heartedly willing to give the driver's test another try. She is now much more open - minded about the entire situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was extremely upset and annoyed about failing her driver's test. For example, “the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I - I failed the test,” Saeng said to her mother in a distraught voice. Obviously, she was deeply upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn't want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe that this attitude was because of the memories of her mother country that soothe her and also the loving support of her mother. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a valuable lesson that one should let change occur and understand that time does heal emotional wounds.
1738	10610	4	3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the motivational paragraph because he/she wants to clearly show the reader that Saeng is firmly determined to adapt to her new life and home and bravely overcome common obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a really hard time coping with her problem, so she bought a hibiscus because it vividly reminded her of home. I think that the line “and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” from the last paragraph is a powerful symbol for growing up and successfully overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a heart - warming and satisfying ending that leaves a positive impression on the reader.
1739	10611	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she is going to have significantly higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story, the geese had flew away. So when the geese return, the sight and sound of the geese will vividly remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes, the hibiscus flower will bloom once again, bringing with it a sense of renewal and hope for her test - taking endeavor.
1740	10612	4	3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” when spring comes back, it brings new hopes, comfort, and belief. As she said in the story, “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” When she hears that the hibiscus comes back, it brings new hopes to her life for taking that test. Here, the hibiscus means hope. Second of all, when she said “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” she means that it is a source of comfort for her. This comfort is stronger than hope, and it is even more powerful when her mom helps boost her belief in herself because it is not easy to do it without her mom's comfort. Lastly, she said “Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She means that as the season is coming and the hibiscus grows, she will regain the belief and the strength that she needs to take the test. The hibiscus means a great deal to her as it represents new hopes, comfort, and belief, which are essential for her to face the test with courage.
1741	10613	4	3	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng, feeling dejected, is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished memories about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to the beautiful flowers that grew by her old home, with their bright colors and gentle fragrance. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, who has to adjust to a new environment, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind, if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she, and she will surely succeed next time."
1742	10614	4	3	The story of “Winter Hibiscus” is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland deeply but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, such as the new culture and daily life here, and pass her driver's test to gain more independence. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, when the world is full of new life, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleviates some home - sickness, making her feel a bit closer to her homeland. Saeng’s promise indicates that she is coming to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying in the sky, forming beautiful patterns, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.” I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that she is allowing herself to change and embrace the new life.
1743	10615	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotional connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back vivid memories of the happy times they spent together. The sight and smell of the hibiscus make her acutely aware of the loss. Later on in the story, she carefully takes the plant to her mother. At first, her mother is upset as she might not understand Saeng's strong attachment at that moment, but then she becomes understanding of her daughter’s actions and feelings, realizing how much the hibiscus means to Saeng. Saeng is upset that she didn't pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because she wants the reader to see that because the hibiscus is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, it will give her a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing the test.
1744	10616	4	3	Since it is getting close to winter, the weather is getting colder and the geese are going south in search of warmer places. The plants are losing their leaves, looking a bit bare and lifeless. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return in a lively flock and the hibiscus buds, with its delicate petals starting to unfurl, it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother. When she first saw it and gently held the leaf, it brought a tear to her eye, as a flood of memories rushed back. And when it comes back next year, blooming beautifully, it will rejuvenate her spirit and give her the strength to face the test again.
1745	10617	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to Saeng very well. This paragraph neatly summarizes Saeng's emotional journey throughout the story. It shows her struggles, her connection to the hibiscus, and her new - found determination. By ending with this, the author allows the readers to understand Saeng's growth and her readiness to move forward, making the whole story complete and leaving a lasting impression on the readers.
1746	10618	4	3	The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it clearly shows the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscuses, and how deeply one can feel just by seeing it. It also shows that the hibiscus motivates her because it vividly reminds her of her homeland that she loves so dearly, and it's like having a physical memory of her cherished homeland. This connection adds a poignant touch to the story's conclusion.
1747	10619	4	3	The author is relating to the idea that when the geese are fully ready, they will surely come back, and when the flower reaches its readiness, it will begin to bud and grow gracefully. Similarly, when she is truly ready, she will take the test, which is what is being subtly conveyed. She is explaining that she, just like the geese and flowers, needs a reasonable amount of time. So, one can effectively compare Saeng to both the geese and hibiscus because they, in their own ways, also require time to be ready to do what they are meant to do. In a sense, Saeng has seamlessly molded as one with both these natural objects, highlighting the patience and timing in life.
1748	10620	4	3	I think the author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolizes how the girl perceives things. The girl means that when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, it clearly indicates that it is going to be warm again. This warmth brings her spirit up significantly because it vividly reminds her of her homeland. I believe that by her being reminded of her homeland, it would help her take the test more easily as she will be in a happier state of mind. This positive state of mind, I think, will undoubtedly help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower brings her a sense of comfort. I firmly believe that being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion, I think the author ends the story like that because they wanted the readers to understand the strong connection between the girl and her homeland, and how the flower provides her with much - needed comfort.
1749	10621	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sounds like a truly interesting ending paragraph that has a direct and significant connection with the story. It ties up loose ends and leaves the reader with a sense of closure while still piquing their interest, making it a fitting conclusion to the narrative.
1750	10622	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it clearly shows that she is gradually adapting to the new place. It also emphatically shows that she isn't going to give up easily. Just like the geese don't give up flying back and forth every winter and spring, facing various challenges along the way, she too is determined to persevere in her new environment. This comparison emphasizes her resilience and the hope for a successful adaptation.
1751	10623	4	3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng decides to retake her failed driver’s test in the spring. She makes this decision because she finds comfort in the moderate weather of the spring. Its gentle warmth and pleasant breeze remind her of home, and Saeng is deeply and very closely attached to her home. This feeling of nostalgia makes her long for the familiarity and security it represents. It reminds me of all the places I've been and how, even after all this time, I still vividly remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I have a habit of buying objects that remind me of my old home. Saeng’s strong commitment to her old home makes me feel less alone when I miss my old home, as it shows that the longing for a familiar place is a shared human experience.
1752	10624	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is determined to start over and do better the second time around. She has a strong sense of self - respect and does not want to disappoint herself with another failure. Knowing that she has the potential to succeed, she is ready to face the challenge again. That is precisely why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it showcases Saeng's resilience and determination.
1753	10625	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it clearly shows a new beginning. When the spring arrives, the world undergoes a remarkable transformation. Everything comes back to life in a vibrant display of nature's renewal. Plants that were once dormant grow back with fresh green leaves and colorful blossoms. Animals that had hidden away during the cold winter are seen again, scurrying about or singing in the trees. The sun shines bright, spreading warmth and light across the land. This is a new beginning for them, and it can be seen in the same light for Saeng. She could try again because the arrival of spring gives her another chance at success. Another reason the author ended the story like this is because Saeng has a deep love for nature. Maybe when nature is back around her, with its beauty and vitality, it will infuse her with hope and confidence to pass her test.
1754	10626	4	3	The last paragraph of the story was: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story, she is visibly upset and not really fond of the change. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept,” the text says. This shows her initial struggle with the new situation. However, this last paragraph seems optimistic, talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning, which seems like she is starting to accept the change. In my opinion, the author added that paragraph to finish the story on a positive note, to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic about her future.
1755	10627	4	3	Saeng told her mother that she failed the test. She felt really bad about it and wanted to make up for it. So, she decided to help out in the garden. She knew that working in the garden was something useful she could do to atone for her failure. Her mother welcomed her in and then started to make dinner, perhaps appreciating Saeng's attempt to make amends.
1756	10628	4	3	The Author concludes that, when the geese come back in the spring, she will take the test because she believes she will be more fully prepared for the test. She thinks it will be easier in the spring as this will give her more dedicated time to learn and study thoroughly. Hopefully, her head will be more focused, instead of being distracted by thoughts about her home. It will indeed be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels extremely bad as if she let her mother down by failing it. “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this shows that she felt so ashamed that she couldn't even look at her mother. So next spring, she is determined to make her mom happy and pass the test because she will be truly ready.
1757	10629	4	3	The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow gradually melts and all the geese gracefully return, the flowers @CAPS1. That one particular flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on, which seems to hold some symbolic significance in the context of the story.
1758	10630	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to firmly tell people never to give up. She conveys this message to people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be well - prepared. In the story, the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could imply that she realizes what happens; happens and one should never stop striving towards a goal they desire. One more reason she @MONTH1 might have used this is that even though you're feeling down, you have friends and family to support and pick you up from it. The line “Ö Through the quiet repetition of season upon season.” This basically indicates that she just needed to establish a routine and she will be able to achieve her goal.
1759	10631	4	3	The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a clear comparison between the resilience of flowers and the perseverance required for the test. To finish with this shows she will try season after season, just as geese return faithfully every year. Since she attempts to make this comparison, it shows she hasn't given up and will keep trying year after year. Also, it clearly demonstrates that this girl is highly determined and she won't stop trying until she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph can offer valuable insights about the whole story. Lastly, I think it imparts a distinct feeling for the entire story, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
1760	10632	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph so the reader has something meaningful to think about. When the author concludes with something like that, he/she wants the reader to craft their own ending or make their own prediction. And sometimes, this kind of ending implies the possibility of a sequel, leaving the story open - ended and full of potential.
1761	10633	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it creates a happy ending where the protagonist doesn't give up and is taking the test again. She is determined not to disappoint her mom; instead, she wants to make her happy by giving the test a second chance. This conclusion leaves a positive impression, showing the character's resilience and hope for a better outcome.
1762	10634	4	3	She ends it with that statement to clearly show that she is fully ready to relive spring in the new country now that she has found comfort in the hibiscus. The test here represents the process of adapting to the new country, and she believes she failed it because she needed the solace of her native plants. However, she is confident that she will pass the test next year as each repetition of the season allows her to become more accustomed to the new culture. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,” all these natural signs tell her it's a new year, making it easier for her to accept the changes happening around her and move forward with hope.
1763	10635	4	3	She realized that things come and go and also undergo changes. During certain times of the year, the world around her transformed, and she had no control over these changes. Additionally, she had to cope with the challenges of living in a new country. Living in a new country was extremely difficult for Saeng. She had to try new foods, listen to unfamiliar sounds, and see things she had never witnessed before. Failing her driver's test was a hard blow for her. Not knowing the language and what was going on around her was tough on her as the world around her was not what she was used to. She understood that she had to change herself and work harder to achieve what she desired, and this self - awareness would guide her towards better adaptation.
1764	10636	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph to clearly let the readers know that the protagonist did not give up. Throughout the story, it seemed like she had fleeting thoughts of giving up, but the memories and thoughts of her homeland provided her with comfort whenever she felt on the verge of quitting. However, in the last paragraph of the story, she firmly confirmed that she was not going to give up, leaving the readers with a sense of her determination and perseverance.
1765	10637	4	3	I think the author concludes this story like this because the beautiful `@CAPS1 were seen as symbols that gave her good luck. The @NUM1 time around, she didn't know they were there, but now their presence might bring a different outcome. The author likely wants to end the story on an optimistic note, suggesting that these beautiful elements could change her fortune and lead to a more positive result.
1766	10638	4	3	To me it seems like whoever was saying that must have been going through a lot of difficult things and that they were feeling like they were being tested or something. Or maybe somebody left her whom she really loved because it says “when they come back”. So @CAPS1 is thinking somebody @MONTH1 has left or something. And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 might have felt as if they were being tested is because it says “I will take the test again”. This indicates that they've faced a challenging situation and are ready to confront it once more.
1767	10639	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because it clearly shows that she is still uncomfortable. For instance, when she broke down in the flower shop, it was a vivid display of her unease. This shows that even though certain things can remind her of home, it isn't the same. You have to gradually get used to and become accustomed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to adjust to her new home, she will be able to pass the test of truly feeling at home there.
1768	10640	4	3	The author uses this conclusion for a well - thought - out reason. The reason the author uses this cliff - hanger of a conclusion is to effectively keep the reader interested and constantly wanting more. By saying, “I will take that test again”, the author makes the reader deeply question if Saeng will pass the test next time. Moreover, the reader will also wonder what “the test” actually is. This sense of mystery compels the reader to keep thinking about the story long after they've finished reading.
1769	10641	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn't want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldn't return. The return of the geese might bring back painful memories or signify a change she isn't ready for. Also, I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking. By sharing these thoughts, the author gives the reader a deeper insight into Saeng's state of mind and her emotional connection to the environment.
1770	10642	4	3	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to clearly show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng previously was upset and tearing the plant apart out of frustration. But it seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud against the odds and survive. This realization inspired her. So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed. This shows that even in the face of failure, one can find motivation and the will to try again.
